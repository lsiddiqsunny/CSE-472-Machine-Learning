"<p>I would like to buy a 3D printer, but I'm concerned about the health risks that are associated with its operation. Some groups of scientists say it can be <a href=""http://www.techworld.com/news/personal-tech/scientists-warn-of-3d-printing-health-effects-as-tech-hits-high-street-3460992/"">harmful</a> for humans.</p>

<p>What do I need to consider before buying a 3D printer if I care about my health? Are there any safe printers?</p>

"<p>I know the minimum layer height will effect how detailed of an item you can print and the amount of time it takes to print something, but is it necessary to have an extremely low minimum layer height if you plan to print only larger objects?</p>

"<p>Plastic is used in 3D FDM/FFF printing partly because it had a wide temperature range for its glass state - where it can be flowed with some force, but won't flow due only to gravity.</p>

<p>Most metals have a very narrow, or non-existant, glass state.  They transition from solid to liquid with almost no flowable-but-not-liquid state.</p>

<p>Are there any metals or alloys that display a glass transition state?</p>

<p>What are techniques to print objects with more than two colors for one object?</p>
"
"<p>Filament is the plastic strands used as the print material for 3d printers. The most common types are PLA and ABS. There are also other types of filament that used other types of plastics as well as other materials.</p>
"
For questions related to different filaments used as the print material.
"<p>Almost all 3D printers have issues that could cause health problems.</p>

<p>FDM/FFF printers heat plastic to a temperature that may cause it to off-gas, and these byproducts may not be healthy.</p>

<p>SLA printers often use epoxies that may off-gas, or may be somewhat toxic prior to being cured.</p>

<p>Powder based printers can also off-gas, in addition to the powder itself presenting a possible hazard.</p>

<p>Many hobbyist and small companies dance around the problem, and suggest that the machines always be used in well ventillated areas.  Professional machines often have filters and ventillation systems built in.</p>

<p>Rather than trying to find a ""perfectly safe"" 3D printer, spend some time deciding what you want to use one for, find printers suitable for your use, and expect that you'll need to provide reasonable ventilation for almost any printer.  Plan your installation for that, and you should be able to make any printer safe for your required use.</p>

<p>If, however, you plan on setting up a printer farm with many printers, and plan to have yourself or others spend significant time operating them, I suggest you work with a health and safety professional and have them identify possible hazards and plan mitigation.</p>

"<p>I'd like to print modifications for my birdfeeder, both to patch over the hail damage from last summer and to try to deter the neighborhood squirrels.  I have an FDM printer (and experience with nylon, ABS, and PLA, though don't restrict answers to those if there's something else that's better), what kind of filament would stand up best to daily exposure to sun, rain, snow, etc?</p>
"
"<p>Surface of my printed parts using PLA plastic look rough and uneven.</p>

<p>Does changing filament to a better one would do any difference?</p>

<p>If not, what kind of methods I can use to achieve a smoother finish for my for 3D printed objects?</p>
"
"<p>There is very little information about safety available, as home 3D printers are relatively new. However, plastics such as ABS have a long history in making plastic products, and a study found that at traditional manufacturing methods (such as injection molding and hot wire cutting) <a href=""http://annhyg.oxfordjournals.org/content/57/3/399"">do not release dangerous levels of carcinogens and/or respiratory sensitizers in to the air</a>.</p>

<p>Of course, 3D printers are not among the processes covered in the study. In home 3D printing circles, <a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1352231013005086"">this study</a> that looks at ultrafine particle (UFP) emissions, is often cited. It finds that printing ABS releases relatively high levels of UFP's and PLA releases significantly fewer (but still quite a large amount). However, it is unclear whether/how dangerous these UFP's are in the amounts emitted.</p>

<p>It is often suggested that PLA, partly because of the reduced UFP emissions is safer to print than ABS, partly because of its ""natural"" origins as it can be derived from materials such as cornstarch. I would caution against this line of reasoning since ""natural"" materials can still be poisonous (snake venom is natural, after all) and the cornstarch is heavily processed so it hardly resembles its original form. The lower UFP emissions may suggest it is safer, but the study is only quantitative, not qualitative.</p>

<p>That said, PLA does probably pose less of a risk (despite my earlier argumentation against ""natural"" materials, PLA does play quite nicely with the human body), but I contend the risk with ABS is not too large anyways, given that it has been safely used in factories for decades.</p>

<p><a href=""http://fire.nist.gov/bfrlpubs/fire86/art017.html"">Another study</a> is often miscited, supposedly saying that 3D printing ABS releases hydrogen cyanide. The study only looks at the thermal decomposition of ABS, which happens at significantly higher temperatures than are reached during printing (but a significantly malfunctioning printer might cause toxic gasses to be released, but I contend that at that point you should worry about your printer being on fire, rather than temporary exposure to some toxins).</p>

<p>There are no printers out there that are fundamentally safer than others. However, some printers have an enclosure (containing the fumes) and some even have a carbon filter and a fan for fume extraction. If you would like to err on the side of caution, this might be a good choice (but again, it is not clear if a carbon filter is totally effective).</p>

<p>Finally, as printers are generally quite noisy it tends to be preferrable to keep your printer in a separate room from where you usually work. In this case, fume exposure (during the few minutes that you go to check on your print) is minimal, and the potential advantages of a ""safer"" printers or using ""safer"" materials diminish.</p>

<p>Incidental exposure as a hobbyist is probably not a big deal; workers in factories are exposed to the fumes of melted plastic their entire lives and they don't seem to be dropping dead. On the other hand, if you are going to be printing structurally then it is probably preferable to move your printer to a separate room, if not because of health and safety because of the noise.</p>
"
"<p>With an ABS or PLA extrusion 3D printer, are there any potentially negative quality differences that could occur if I try to print at a higher resolution?</p>

<p>I am not concerned about print time as the equipment is not under high demand.  I am, however, worried the device may be more prone to fracture, likely to have defects, or have other issues I cannot currently imagine.</p>
"
"<p>I would like to print parts (e.g. jewellery) for use which I don't want to look or feel like a plastic, but metal-like, so briefly people won't see much difference.</p>

<p>Are there any specific type of home-printers that can achieve that? Or it's rather kind of filament that you should use?</p>
"
"<p>Apart from the inherent process itself and direct health hazards from that, many 3D printers also require some complementary technology to work.</p>

<p><a href=""/questions/tagged/fdm"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;fdm&#39;"" rel=""tag"">fdm</a> printers have a printing head that needs to move around in 3D space. <strong>Moving machinery parts can be a hazard</strong>. In a home/hobbyist environment with children for example, I would recommend to buy a printer with a housing. </p>

<p>""open"" designs often feature <strong>bare electronics</strong> mounted directly to the printer structure. This rises the possibility of short circuits and electric shock.</p>

<p>The printers that heat material often do so at very high temperatures. <strong>Hot parts of the printer</strong> should not be touched.</p>
"
"<p>I am aware of several ""clear"" filaments for a ABS or PLA printer.  They, however, have a cloudy or frosted glass appearance. I do not believe this is possible to eliminate but I believe it can be reduced.</p>

<p>Are there effective ways to make a print have a more transparent appearance?</p>
"
"<p>I""m no expert on this, but the article at <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amorphous_metal"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amorphous_metal</a> may be relevant for you.</p>

<p>There are some special alloys, such as gold/silicon and various titanium-based ones, that become ""bulk metal glasses"" if cooled extremely quickly (for example, by sputtering onto a spinning cold surface). The speed of cooling prevents crystal formation. Early BMGs were quite strong but brittle; improvements have reduced brittleness and required cooling speed.</p>
"
"<p>PET(G) is a strong contender. It is very strong and water-resistant, and as such is often used to make pop bottles.</p>

<p>PLA has a reputation for being ""biodegradable"" and therefore it is often discouraged to use PLA outside and/or in contact with water. However, PLA only biodegrades under very specific conditions which it won't generally be exposed to so it can be used (though, as a harder and less flexible material it is more likely to be damaged by hail).</p>

<p>ABS and Nylon are good choices as well. Basically, any plastic you have on hand will last for years, even in an outside application.</p>
"
"<p>My printed parts consist rafts, supports and other extraneous filament when printing with ABS or PLA.</p>

<p>What are efficient general techniques of removing them?</p>
"
"<p>I would like to understand the differences between rafts, skirts and brims. They appear in the software which I'm using to edit my 3D objects.</p>

<p>Can anybody elaborate what are these and what are the main differences between them?</p>
"
"<p>It is called <strong>Acetone Finishing</strong></p>

<p>Basically the 3D printed part stays in acetone vapor and the outer shell turns to smooth surface. PS: I heard that it works better with ABS. </p>

"<p>I've acquired all the parts to build a Reprap Prusa i3 rework, the only missing part is the frame. </p>

<p>I'm in doubt between a MDF cut (cheaper) or acrylic (more expensive), of course a cheaper one is my preferred option until I see any disadvantage on making it of wood. </p>

<p>I thought about variables like heat and humidity and the possibility of expansion/contraction of the frame, is this a valid concern? Will I have more precision buying the acrylic one or is it irrelevant?</p>

"<p>Use Taulman t-glase and after a light sanding with really fine paper (optional really, but go for it if you can), spray it with polyurethane varnish or something similar. Check out the article <a href=""http://3dprint.com/29292/taulman-hacks-clear-t-glase-3d-printing-material/"">here</a>.</p>

"<p>Generally speaking, MDF will weather OK. In areas of high humidity you might experience warpage, and you can mitigate that by sealing the surface with paint or varnish. However you will probably find that of the two materials acrylic will be more stable over a few years. </p>
"
"<p>The most obvious solution is to pause the print and swap filament for another color.</p>

<p>Another option is to <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdlqGR5n9Zk"">splice pieces of filament</a> together, though this does not allow very precise control of when the switch happens. There is also a device that can automatically slice filament this way.</p>

<p>Finally, another option that uses very little external equipment is to <a href=""http://reprap.org/wiki/Coloring_filament"">use (permanent) markers to colorize light-colored filament</a>.</p>

<p>Other options include upgrading to a printer with more hotends, or installing a hotend with multiple filament inputs and one outputs, but these options would involve significantly changing your printer setup.</p>

<p>What kind of printer is required to do that, briefly how long it takes and how much does it cost? Is this even achievable at home? Doesn't need to be that specific one. </p>
"
"<p>You can make a mold from the print and then get a cast from that mold with a clear casting material.</p>
"
"<p>Your two easiest options are dipping your print in acetone or giving it an acetone vapor bath. Note this process generally only works with <strong>ABS</strong> not <strong>PLA</strong>, with the exception of some brands. There are <a href=""http://fabsterdam.com/3dprinting/smoothing-pla/"" rel=""nofollow"">many</a> <a href=""http://fabsterdam.com/3dprinting/smooooooth/"" rel=""nofollow"">articles</a> <a href=""https://ultimaker.com/en/community/10412-acetone-finishing-on-pla"" rel=""nofollow"">online</a> where you can learn more about the process.</p>

<p>Aside from finishing, you will generally get a smoother looking end result by <strong>lowering the layer thickness</strong>, and <strong>removing any hysteresis/wobble</strong> in your print head making sure it's well calibrated.</p>
"
"<p>You will need a laser sintering or lasercusing printer, which will not be something you can buy for home use. They are horribly expensive.</p>

<p>You could always print this in PLA or ABS and cast it in aluminium. Then you have to find a safe method to test the result, because casting is not quite as simple as it looks and the bike could be seriously dangerous.</p>
"
"<p>There is a 3D desktop printer <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RepRap_project"">RepRap</a> which can print most of its own components.</p>

<p>Assuming each printed printer will print the next one and so on. Are there any limitation how many times this can be achieved?</p>

<p>For example somebody printed for me printer and I do the same for my friends and they do the same for theirs. Can this go forever (since 3D model stays the same), or there are any serious side-effects/disadvantages of doing that continuously?</p>
"
"<p>PLA parts can be finished with a coat of epoxy like <a href=""http://www.smooth-on.com/Epoxy-Coatings-XTC/c1397_1429/index.html"">XTC-3D from Smooth-On</a> this will smooth out the part and give it a pretty nice shine. </p>

<p>I've also had a fair amount of success sanding prints, giving them a coat of automotive filler primer, and using glossy spray paint. </p>

<p>You can also get great results with a acetone vapor finish if you're willing to switch to ABS. Though that will require a heated bed and can be a bit more finicky to work with than PLA.</p>
"
"<p>On a number of occasions, I've broken small plastic parts that are nearly impossible to replace, but could easily be 3-D printed, and to me seems like one of the most useful possible applications for 3D printing.  The latest such mishap is the volume knob on the factory-installed radio on my car.  </p>

<p>I have little experience in 3D printing, but would like to be able to replace these parts with something very close to the original.  If necessary, I'll design them by measuring the broken pieces and drawing the piece in software, but I'd prefer something to scan the broken pieces in 3D and somehow just seal up the seam where it's broken.</p>

<p>Is there a scanning/printing/software system to do this, and what's the easiest way to accomplish what I need?</p>

"<p>Acetone vaporing is a great way to smooth ABS prints. For PLA, however, acetone smoothing does not work. An <a href=""http://fabsterdam.com/3dprinting/smoothing-pla/"">article about smoothing PLA</a> says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is a pity, since PLA is much easier to work with than ABS.

"<p>I have a few kg of 3mm filament when I only have use for 1.75mm.</p>

<p>How can I make 1.75mm from 3mm filament?</p>
"
"<p>The files used to print these objects are digital, and do not degrade in any way after each printing. There are no side effects or degradation that occurs over time due simply to printing them multiple times.</p>

<p>This is the RepRap philosophy, and the machines are actually designed with enough tolerance for printing and building mistakes that even if the print isn't perfect, it will not only work fine, but it can print a printer better than it was printed, with some care and attention to calibration.</p>

<p>The process still takes a lot of human intervention, in the way of building the new printer and properly calibrating it.  If there are errors in the printer or the prints it produces, they can almost always be attributed to the builder/calibrator/user, and not to the design or the fact it's the Nth generation of printer.</p>

"<p>I would like to print 3D desktop printer, but currently I know only <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RepRap_project"" rel=""nofollow"">RepRap</a> project. Ideally I'm looking for some better quality or larger alternatives (e.g. for printing larger parts than RepRap allows).</p>

<p>Are there any?</p>
"
"<p>The easiest way is as you currently do: model the pieces by hand, using (digital) calipers to measure them.</p>

<p>Scanning technology isn't very good, and the models are not of printable quality. Usually, fixing a scan is more work than modeling an item from scratch.</p>
"
"<p>The best option is to find somebody in need of 3mm filament and trade them for it (either in exchange for 1.75mm filament or in exchange for legal tender with which to buy said filament).</p>

<p>The next best option would be to cut it into small pieces, and feed those into a filament extrusion system such as the <a href=""http://www.filastruder.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">filastruder</a>.</p>
"
"<p>In theory, making filament is easy.  You take a 3mm hotend with a 1.75mm hole, and extrude the 3mm filament, let it cool, and then reel it up.</p>

<p>In reality there are a lot of pitfalls to making filament - if the pressure isn't even, the hole not perfect, the temperature uneven, you can end up with oval filament, filament with bubbles, or worse.  If you are over temperature you may damage the filament and it could look good, but not melt correctly when used.  If you reel it too fast you may thin it out more than the intended diameter, or too slow and you may thicken it. A lot of hotends use steppers, which may result in ripples in the filament, so you may end up building a nearly custom filament machine.</p>

<p>Resolving all these problems is probably not worth simply selling or giving away the filament to someone that can use it, and buying the right size for your machine.</p>

<p>If you are still interested, though, you might as well go all the way and build a full filament extruder that accepts raw plastic feedstock (usually pellets) as well as your filament, and convert it that way, then continue using it to create your own filament.</p>
"
"<p>You could build a machine that has a nozzle with 3 mm input hole and 1.75 mm output hole, based on some designs for filament making machines. Or you could just cut the filament into little peaces and use them instead of the granulate in an original filament making machines.</p>

<p>There are some open designs for such machines <a href=""http://www.instructables.com/id/Build-your-own-3d-printing-filament-factory-Filame/"" rel=""nofollow"">you can build</a>, or you could buy one, such as <a href=""http://www.filabot.com/collections/filabot-core"" rel=""nofollow"">Filabot</a>.</p>

<p>However, as mentioned by <a href=""http://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/users/36/kaine"">kaine</a>, this is very unlikely to be worth the cost/effort. Best option for you is to try to sell the 3 mm filament to someone who has a use for it, take the money and buy some 1.75 mm filament instead.</p>

"<p>The reprap printers have often been compared to plants, providing fruits to you and the possibility to reproduce themselves.</p>

<p>This analogy holds in both good and bad ways. Any life form can reproduce itself only so often without artefacts (mutations) being introduced.</p>

<p>It takes a bit of <strong>skill to build, configure and run a reprap printer</strong>. While the parts can be passed on, that doesn't necessarily hold for gained experience.
Chances are that the parts your printer produces are not as good as those that you have received to build the printer. At least not until you caught up on the learning curve.</p>

<p>A reprap has a lot <strong>other parts that are not printed and can vary in quality independently from the printed parts</strong>. It makes a difference what steel rods are used, what driver circuit for the motors, etc. If you give printed parts away that are as good as those that you received yourself, the added parts are not necessarily as good as your.</p>

<hr>

<p>My recommendation would be that <strong>you and your friends get printer parts from that somebody and you build your printers together</strong>. While giving parts to others is a great thing, building 3D printers together with friends is greater. </p>

"<p>I am printing a print using PLA on a Prusa i3 printer and an MK8 extruder, at 210 degrees celsius, 60 mm/sec, sliced with slic3r. The print consists of a base, with 4 tower-like projections that then join with a near-vertical overhang slope that isn't posing a problem for my printer.</p>

<p>However, even before the overhang begins, I am getting large amounts of strings as the extruder head jumps between the four towers in the print, leading to a ""spiderweb"" effect between them. How can I deal with these strings, and are they a warning that there might be something amiss with my printer, or possible other failures in other parts of the print?</p>

"<p>When using thermoplastic-filament, this can be potentially <a href=""http://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/q/2/20"">hazardous</a>, since constant printing can emit hazardous fumes and odors that may be emitted by heating the plastics.</p>

<p>Are there any practical methods of limiting such exposure? For example locking it in some special box, covering it or suck the odors? Would that help?</p>

<p>Do you have any experience doing so?</p>
"
"<p>You could experiment with slicing. For example, you might not need high resolution all over the object, but you can speed up some straight parts by using greater layer high there. See a <a href=""http://manual.slic3r.org/expert-mode/variable-layer-height"" rel=""nofollow"">part of Slic3r manual</a> about such thing.</p>

<p>It is also possible to print thicker infill every Nth layer, see <a href=""http://manual.slic3r.org/expert-mode/infill-optimization"" rel=""nofollow"">Infill optimization</a> in Slic3r.</p>

<p>Other slicers might have those features as well.</p>
"
"<p>Stringing is often a result of too-high a temperature, or insufficient retraction. When there is highly liquid filament in the nozzle tip, it can adhere to the remainder of the print while dripping as the nozzle moves, leading to a thin string of the filament forming. As further travel moves are performed in each layer, this turns to a web.</p>

<p>The high temperature causes filament to be very liquid, causing it to move downward in the nozzle chamber easily, as opposed to having to be extruded forcefully due to viscosity. The temperature setpoint of 210 was high enough to cause this to happen.</p>

<p>A second possible cause, insufficient retraction, can also be blamed for this issue. Retraction is a process in which the extruder reverses its movement to pull filament back up the hotend, preventing it from dripping at the tip, and forming a string. Most slicers will allow specifying a numeric value in millimeters of filament to be retracted. Remember that printers with Bowden tubes between nozzle/hotend and extruder motor will require increased retraction and priming (extrusion when starting to print after a retract-and-move). Note that too much retraction can cause other problems, such as insufficient plastic in the hotend chamber at the start of the next printing move, which can cause gaps and other issues.</p>

  <p>parts ... I don't want to ... feel like a plastic</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is harder than looking like metal.  Plastic doesn't have nearly the density of metal, nor the thermal conductivity of metal.  So by touch people will be able to tell the difference between almost any metal item, and a plastic item that looks similar.</p>

<p>For jewelry, as long as the wearer doesn't mind that it's not metal (they will be able to tell) you can fool most viewers with proper finishing.  Sanding/smoothing, and then painting the printed part will work for most things.</p>

<p>For things which dangle significantly, the swinging and action of the item may give away its density, but some objects people expect to be hollow metal can be printed in solid or high density plastic and give the same weight, though they are lower density. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Are there any specific type of home-printers that can achieve that?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For things which feel metallic, no, except for very small items where the weight and thermal conductivity won't be significant.  A laser sintering printer could make real metal parts if this is needed, but these don't fall into the category of home machines.</p>

<p>If you don't mind a multi step process, you can make molds of the printed object, then cast real metal, or very high density epoxies, to accomplish your goal.</p>

<p>Beyond that, a high resolution machine with a lot of hand-finishing work is going to get you as close as you'll get to looking like metal.</p>

"<p>All three of these features are used to improve the quality and success rate of prints, especially those failing due to issues on the first few layers, or due to the small size of the first layer.</p>

<h1>Raft</h1>

<p>A raft is a horizontal feature made as the first few layers of a print, and is used to help with bed adhesion issues, primarily used with ABS. The first few layers printed are the brim (typically prismatic), with the part itself on top of it (with a small separation distance to aid in separation, to allow the part to be removed from the raft). This separation distance needs to be adjusted to allow the first layer of the actual part to adhere, but also for the raft to be removed easily.</p>

<h1>Skirt</h1>

<p>A skirt is a single-layer feature designed to help extruder priming and to establish a stable filament flow for an optimal first layer. They are generally a few passes around the first layer ""footprint"" in the rough shape of the first layer, but they do not touch the part itself or help adhesion directly (although having a primed and ready extruder helps extrusion on its own). </p>

<h1>Brim</h1>

<p>A brim can be considered a skirt touching the first layer shape. It is used to help adhesion, and increases the first layer surface area (thus having more area to adhere to the bed). Brims are best used for parts with small first layers that fail to adhere properly. They are generally done as perimeters (as opposed to the crosshatching of infill) to be easily removable without damaging the part.</p>

"<p>For ABS print, I recommend <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetone"" rel=""nofollow"">acetone</a>. It is not a glue, but it will dissolve the plastic a bit and if you apply it to both connecting parts and push them together, they will stay connected after the acetone dries. However, it does not dry very fast and you have to be careful not to destroy the object.</p>

<p>For PLA I usually use regular super glue (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyanoacrylate"" rel=""nofollow"">Cyanoacrylate</a>).</p>

"<p>Using negative pressure ventilation and a suitable organic filter will limit your exposure to toxic compounds, but won't completely remove them from your environment.</p>

<p>Enclose your printer in as air-tight a box as you can manage, then use a fan to suck air out of the box.  This negative pressure will ensure that any leaks in the box will not allow gasses to escape.</p>

<p>The air should be blown through an organic filter.  This might be done with face mask filters for painting, for instance.</p>

<p>Additional filtering may be done depending on the compounds you expect the printer to produce, but the ideal situation is to set up a ventilation system to the outdoors where the products cannot concentrate and harm anyone.</p>

<p>Another poorer option is to simply wear a proper organic filter mask yourself.  It's not as good, since the compounds can spread through your residence or remain in the air and be inhaled when you aren't printing.</p>

"<p>I've made a few 3D prints at school on what I assume are very low-end 3D printers, but they seem cheap, flimsy, and pretty ugly.  How much better quality can I expect from professional-level 3D printers (those commonly used by online printing services)?</p>

"<p>Is it possible to re-use ABS or PLA filament material from printed parts?</p>

<p>If so, what is the techniques to reform it?</p>
"
"<p><strong>Rafts:</strong></p>

<p>Rafts are a few layers of plastic a placed on the printing surface before the object is printed.  If non water dissoluble filament is used, a bit of an air gap will be placed between the raft and the print itself so it can be removed easily. A raft can help a print stick to the printing surface as it normally has a larger surface area than the bottom of the print.  It also allows the bottom layers of the print to contact another layer of plastic so there is less spreading compared to printing on the printing bed itself.</p>

<p><strong>Skirts:</strong></p>

<p>Skirts are loops of plastic that are extruded around the object that is being printed.  On the first layer this allows the filament to get pushed through the extruder so that a steady flow can be established.  A multiple layer skirt can be used to create a blockage around the print so there is less air movement on the print and the print can cool slower.</p>

<p><strong>Brims:</strong></p>

<p>A brim is a layer of plastic that is placed on the first layer of the print go allow for better adhesion to the printing surface.  It does not extend under the print as a raft does, but only goes from the edge of the print to a set distance away.  </p>

"<p>I print ABS on a LulzBot Taz 5 and frequently have issues with the corners of objects lifting off the bed.</p>

<p>My extruder is at 230 C and the bed is at 90 C for the first layer and 100 C for the rest of the layers.</p>

<p>I have experimented with using ABS slurry (ABS + acetone) on the bed for increased adhesion, building a foam enclosure for the printer, and varying the fan speed. I have noticed the problem is more common the taller the parts are and the sharper the corner is.</p>

<p>Adding ABS slurry helped for smaller parts (less than an inch tall) but with my more recent larger parts the adhesion to the bed was so good that the corners of the part lifting actually peeled the PEI tape off of the bed.</p>

<p>I have tried using both a skirt and a brim with no change. The skirt stays on the bed, the brim gets pulled up with the corner.</p>
"
"<p>The best way to get rid of them is to change the design of the printed object to make them unnecessary.</p>

<p>Instead of printing the one part with support material, the piece can be split into two or more parts which can be printed without support material and assembled after the printing.</p>

<hr>

<p>Given that this is not always fully possible, a convenient way to get rid of additional structures is to use a different fillament for them that can be removed easily. <a href=""https://www.matterhackers.com/3d-printer-filament-compare"" rel=""nofollow"">This list of printing materials</a> includes Polyvinyl Acetate (<strong>PVA</strong>), which is water soluble. You can wash the support material away given that your actual printign material is not water soluble. Here's a quote from the website (emphasize mine):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>PVA (Polyvinyl Acetate) filament prints translucent with a slightly yellow tint and is <strong>primarily used as a 3D printing support material</strong> because it is water-soluble, meaning that <strong>it will dissolve when exposed to water</strong> (and so MUST be kept dry prior to use). PVA is most often used with 3D printers capable of dual extrusion: one extruder printing a primary material (such as ABS or PLA) and the other printing this dissolvable filament to provide support for overhanging features. PVA 3D printer filament is available in 1.75mm and 3mm.</p>
</blockquote>

"<p>The biggest effect I've see on resolution is due to plastic stress due to thermal gradients.</p>

<p>The higher resolution prints build up more layers of material, and each layer has a cumulative effect on thermal stress.  The upper layers pulling up more as they cool, and the lower layers curling up more strongly as the layer count is increased.</p>

<p>To counteract this, a heated (or even just a draft free) enclosure makes a big difference.  Having a heated print bed helps significantly, as long as the bed itself resists deformation (a sheet metal or PCB bed will bend more than glass under the same tension, for instance).</p>

<p>The actual plastic strength, however, appears increased.  Laying down thinner layers of material appears to increase the bond strength between layers.</p>

"<p>Increasing the distance between the support/raft and the print should allow for easier removal.  Some slicers (such as Slic3r) have settings for 0.0 mm spacing for water dissoluble supports, and 0.2 mm for regular plastic supports.  </p>

<p>Changing the upper surface of the support also can help.  Some slicers will leave the support as lines all the way to contact with the print.  Others will put a full layer on the top of the support before the print.  The full layer allows for better adhesion and the print not falling between the lines, but it makes it harder to remove.</p>

<p>When the raft/support is done with lines, putting pressure on the lines in the opposite direction should cause them to break off.  As you break some of the outer ones, the support can be pulled down which will continuously rip the support off.  There may be a few pieces that remain.  These can be removed with wood chisels. Sliding the pointed end between the support and the print will cut into the plastic which removes the support.  <em>Note: always push the chisel away from you as it may slip.  You do not want a sharp blade moving uncontrollably towards your body./</em> </p>

"<p>A raft helps when the part has few points of contact with the print bed, and doesn't therefore adhere well at points within and without the part.</p>

<p>A brim helps when the part doesn't adhere well around the perimeter of the part.</p>

<p>There are very rare situations where you'll need both, but typically you'll only use one or the other.</p>
"
"<p>A raft will allows for better adhesion for the whole print as the raft attaches to the printing surface and the print attaches to the raft.  Rafts go the full way under the print and are multiple layers compared to a brim which is only 1 layer and on the outside of the print.  Rafts are normally harder to remove than brims because of the less contact with the print.</p>

<p>From my own experiences, the brim does not help a lot with layer adhesion as it is only 1 layer.  I normally use a raft when I need a nice looking 1st layer that is not on the bed or there are not enough contact points.</p>
"
"<p>How can I ensure that my print cools evenly and does not warp? Should I put a fan on the bed?</p>

<p>Will no fan and a tall skirt help?</p>

<p>Or are my edges turning up for another reason?</p>
"
"<p>A raft is used to prevent warping. Instead of printing directly on the build surface, parts are built on top of it. You remove and dispose of a raft post-print. The raft is larger than the part and so has more adhesion. Rafts are primarily used with ABS to help with bed adhesion. Rafts are also used to help stabilize models with small footprints (e.g. a pole), or to create a strong foundation on which to build the upper layers of a model. If your only concern is bed adhesion it is better to use a brim.</p>

<p>A brim is attached to a model and extends outward. Brims typically have several outlines and may be a few layers tall. Brims are often used to stabilize small parts of a model, such as legs of a table, because brims help these areas stay connected to the print bed.</p>

<p>TLDR: brim is only around a model, raft is also under it.</p>
"
"<p>The solution I prefer to prevent ABS withdrawal is using <a href=""http://reprap.org/wiki/BlueTape"" rel=""nofollow"">Blue tape</a> on the bed, and then spread a thin layer of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyvinyl_acetate"" rel=""nofollow"">Polyvinyl acetate</a> (Vinavil glue). </p>

<p>If your printer allows it, you can also print with the bed at 110°C.</p>
"
"<p>After doing the processes that hroncok described, the edges of the print can be finished with a 3D printing pen.  The pen extrudes filament as a regular print head does, but is hand held.  The filament can be extruded on the previous gap between the two prints.  It will melt between the two sides and can be finished to create a smooth connection point.</p>
"
"<p>This is a common problem with ABS. You might prevent it by enclosing the printer inside a box/chamber - that will create a warmer environment and the extruded material will cool down more slowly, hence not creating such a tension.</p>

<p>Other option is to use PLA instead if possible, the problem is not so significant with PLA.</p>
"
"<p>Without more information we cannot address what is causing your edges to turn up. This can depend on the model being printed, the process, the material, the bed, and the method used to bond it to the bed.</p>

<p>As far as the initial question, a fan will most certainly ensure <em>uneven</em> cooling.</p>

<p>The middle of the print is, and will remain, the warmest.  If you want the print to cool evenly, you'll need an enclosure to block out drafts and air currents, and you'll need to bring the heated bed temperature and enclosure temperature down slowly over a long period of time.</p>
"
"<p>Adding a manually added brim with a larger bulk at the corner extremities that you can cut off after printing should help. My larger prints come off the printer looking like tents with concrete weights tied to their corners.</p>

<p>The 'weights' are attached to the print by very short a 2-3 layer (depending on print size) brim-like strip that makes them easy to remove using side cutters. The 'weights' are usually enough to hold the corners of my target print on the plate in conjuction with a weak slurry.  </p>

"<p>Paraphrasing <a href=""http://www.protoparadigm.com/news-updates/the-difference-between-abs-and-pla-for-3d-printing/"">this</a> site. Feel free to add suggestions in the form of comments and I will try to incorporate them.</p>

<p>Summary</p>

<ul>
<li>ABS: Stronger, machinable, more flexible, and more temperature
resistant than PLA. Typically printed on a heated bed. Warping is a common problem when printing ABS.</li>
<li>PLA: Wider range of filaments available, easier and in some cases faster to print. Not as strong as ABS and the fact that its biodegradable could be seen as both a benefit and a drawback.</li>
</ul>

<p>Material Properties:</p>

<ul>
<li>ABS: Strong plastic with mild flexibility. Naturally beige in color. Can be filled and sanded. Higher temperature. Easy to recycle.</li>
<li>PLA: Not as strong as ABS but more rigid. Naturally transparent. More difficult to fill and sand. Can sag in hot temperatures. Sourced from organic matter so it can be broken down in commercial compost facilities.</li>
</ul>

<p>Part Accuracy:</p>

<ul>
<li>ABS: Part warping is a significant issue. Sharp corners will often be rounded.</li>
<li>PLA: Less heat required contributes to less warping. Becomes more liquid at common extruder temperatures so finer details can be printed.</li>
</ul>

<p>Safety and Handling:</p>

<ul>
<li>ABS: Strong burning/melting plastic smell is present when printing ABS. Health concerns have been raised regarding airborne ultrafine particles generated while printing with ABS (<a href=""https://dx.doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.atmosenv.2013.06.050"">ref</a>). ABS will absorb moisture causing popping when the moisture enters the hot end. This leads to discontinuities in the print job.</li>
<li>PLA: Doesn't smell as strongly when printing due to its organic nature. Moisture can also be absorbed into PLA and can irreversibly damage it.</li>
</ul>

"<p>I made a test print for a small gear (~ 1.5 inches in diameter) a few months ago, with a hole through the center. On the first try, the filament (ABS) fused to the print bed, meaning that I had to spend ten minutes scraping off material to loosen it. One solution to this is to use painter's tape spread across the print bed.</p>

<p>This yielded a good print during the next run. The problem with this method was that some of the tape subsequently fused to the backside of the gear; it was so tight that I had to discard the prototype. Multiple varieties of tape made no difference.</p>

<p>Is there a way to continue using this tape without having it fuse to the filament?</p>
"
"<p>The Colorfabb metal filaments are the most metal-like filaments I've used (copper, brass, and bronze) and probably the ones that would make the most sense for jewelry.  While not as dense as solid metal, it's about 3 times as dense as regular plastic and when polished the metal shows through.  Print at 100% infill to make it heavier. Bronzefill is about 3.9g/cm³, about 80% metal by weight, maybe 30-40% by volume.  I wouldn't say the polished result feel like solid metal, but it feels even less like plastic.</p>

<p>There's also Filamet, which promises to be almost entirely made of metal and can be sintered into solid metal, but it hasn't been released yet.</p>
"
"<p>This can highly depend on the slicer you are using. Some software such as Makerware and Slic3r allow you to adjust the settings for the first raft/part layers. I might suggest adjusting this ""Z0"" point to about 1/4-1/2 of your layer height. Essentially the first layer (or two) will not adhere as well.</p>

<p>This is just one suggestion of many solutions. Here are some other variables I could think of off-hand:</p>

<ul>
<li>Type of build plate tape (ie masking, painters, kapton, etc.)</li>
<li>Type of material. I've noticed that PLA is very stubborn if you let the part completely cool after printing and that it's much easier to remove the part from the build plate/raft right after it's complete.</li>
<li>Type of build plate. Are you applying too much heat (if you have a heated bp) for the material such as PLA?</li>
<li>Try lowering your layer height. This will ensure that each strand does not have too much surface area and therefore less chance that it will create a vacuum affect with the build plate. This can, however, result in a worse surface finish.</li>
</ul>

"<p>I would like to print multiple parts continuously (non-interactively), so
I can leave the printer alone for a longer time. So after finish, parts could be moved somehow out from the printing area, so the next can start.</p>

<p>Are there any methods of achieving that with standard desktop printers without having to use multiple printers?</p>
"
"<p>For standard ABS and PLA filament, most distributors recommend storing the filament in an an airtight bag.  Does not doing this actually make print quality worse?  I have left mine in the open for a year and have had no noticeable problems.</p>
"
"<p>There are a few main safety precautions you should consider.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong><a href=""http://sinkhacks.com/building-acetone-vapor-bath-smoothing-3d-printed-parts/"" rel=""nofollow"">Make sure the area is well-ventilated.</a></strong> Acetone is flammable. A buildup of acetone gas could quickly get concentrated, meaning that a single spark could lead to disaster. Using a fan is good; angle it towards an open window. This is also to prevent exposure to acetone because of its toxicity.</li>
<li><strong><a href=""http://www.sciencelab.com/msds.php?msdsId=9927062"" rel=""nofollow"">Be prepared to fight a fire.</a></strong> Should vapor ignite, you may need to fight the fire. If it is large enough, then you should clearly evacuate the area. If it appears to be small, use dry chemical powder to snuff out the fire. Alcohol foam, water spray, and/or fog may be used on slightly larger fires. Acetone is not likely to cause a large inferno to rip through the building. But there's always the chance of a small fire. Be careful.</li>
<li><strong><a href=""https://rivercitylabs.org/acetone-smoothing-chamber-3d-printing/"" rel=""nofollow"">Create a vapor chamber.</a></strong> This is another way to stop a potential fire from spreading. It can also reduce contamination.</li>
<li><strong>Wear gloves.</strong> This can minimize any potential transfer toxic effects. However, skin exposure is unlikely to cause major issues.</li>
</ul>

<p>Acetone is toxic, as I mentioned before, but it is not highly toxic. Exposure via <a href=""http://ccohs.ca/oshanswers/chemicals/chem_profiles/acetone.html"" rel=""nofollow"">the eyes and nose/mouth</a> is the main risk. Skin effects may occur (e.g. mild irritation), but they are minor and generally arise only after long-term exposure (hence the recommendation of gloves in some cases).</p>

<p>Acetone exposure is only a serious problem when a person is repeatedly exposed to levels <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/idlh/67641.html"" rel=""nofollow"">greater than 1,000 ppm</a> (severe effects only arise at much higher levels). It seems unlikely, given a proper ventilation system, that this will be an issue</p>

<p>In addition to all this, basic safety precautions such as wearing a ventilator mask and goggles should definitely be taken. When working with any such chemicals with the potential for bodily harm, these should absolutely be used.</p>
"
"<p>There are many different approaches to solving this issue and most of the answers already are spot-on. However, the fundamental reason for the ""warping"" is incorrect and inconsistent temperature across the material.</p>

<p>If there is too much fluctuation in the temperature across the object in this heated state can result in warping. The reason you see this mostly on the build plate is because the temperature of the first few layers of molten plastic vary much more against the build plate than against higher layers. Note that you can see additional warping mid-print using ABS and this can be a result of a draft or sudden drop in ambient temperature.</p>

<p>So, to help solve your problem, here are some suggestions (sorry if there are duplicates):</p>

<ul>
<li>Completely enclose/seal your machine's build area to reduce (or eliminate if possible) draft and prevent the natural heat of the machine from escaping.</li>
<li>Increase the temperature on your build plate. I almost exclusively use ABS on my printer and I keep my HBP at about 112C. However, I live in the NW of the US, so my climate is naturally cooler than say Florida.</li>
<li>Alternatively, try decreasing the nozzle temperature to a lower point within the ABS melting range. This will just shorten the gap between the inconsistencies in temperature across layers. It is typically better to print at lower temperatures if you can help it. Obviously there are differences in the filament, so you'll have to find that ""sweet spot"".</li>
<li>Ensure your build plate is flat and your tape doesn't have bubbles. Your BP being flat should be a no brainer, but if your kapton tape (or whatever you use) has bubbles, your freshly printed plastic may not be getting the same temperature from the BP as the rest of your part. This is a bad thing as mentioned earlier.</li>
<li>Use extra adhesion techniques such as ""ABS Glue"" (ABS w/ acetone) or even hairspray. This works about 80% of the time for me, but can make it a bit difficult when removing the parts off the BP.</li>
</ul>

"<p><strong>Humidity may be the problem.</strong></p>

<p><a href=""http://3dprint.com/68083/airtight-filament-delivery/"" rel=""nofollow"">Humidity tends to degrade filament, making it weaker.</a> If you leave a coil of filament out, over time it will be exposed to humidity. I have yet to hear of this happening over a short period of time - the real threat comes if you leave it out for weeks or months - but it can happen nonetheless.</p>

<p>Contamination with other materials is possible but unlikely. The odds of some sort of impurity developing from nearby particles is extremely low unless the filament is actively exposed to some other material.</p>

<p>In most cases, though, things should be just fine.</p>
"
"<p>It depends on a lot of factors, type of plastic, whether the parts need to be strong, can you use a vase print, etc.  Here's a few thoughts.</p>

<p>PLA - The brand of PLA makes a big difference, some can be printed very clear, some can't.  Most of the transparent PLAs I've used print much more clear at around 240°C.</p>

<p>ABS - I've seen some pretty impressive clear parts printed as a single layer shell in ABS and then vapor smoothed. I tend to find ABS more translucent and less transparent though.</p>

<p>PETG - Again the specific PETG you use matters, but I haven't seen nearly as much variation as with PLA.  I'm not sure how much temperature matters, but if it's too hot you get bubbles which will decrease clarity.</p>

<p>Thin Wall Prints - I don't have much experience here, but the Smooth On XTC-3D or vapor smoothing seem to be effective.</p>

<p>Solid Prints
If I want transparency, I usually print it at 100% infill (should be a real 100%, too much overextrusion or underextrusion will decrease transparency).  Printing slower and with less cooling sometimes helps.  It's easier to get the infill solid with a direct drive extruder, I couldn't get decent results with a long bowden tube (a short bowden tube works fine).</p>

<p>Here's a page where I tested 10 transparent filaments, the printed samples are 2mm thick, 100% infill - <a href=""http://thrinter.com/10-transparent-filaments"">http://thrinter.com/10-transparent-filaments</a>.  Those samples are all overextruded a bit, you can get better results if you dial in the extrusion precisely, but that's hard to get right, and the optimal settings may change slightly depending on the part geometry.  Larger nozzles and thicker layers may help to, but I haven't experimented much with that as there are significant downsides to that approach.</p>
"
"<p>I haven't had any other issues storing it in the open, but keeping it in an airtight environment (especially if you live in a humid environment) keeps it moisture free, which can effect print quality. Manufacturers recommend this to help keep filament dry.</p>
"
"<p>I've seen where certain slicers and/or firmware installations will allow you to set pauses mid-print so you can insert a different filament and resume. Such firmware that I'm aware of is <a href=""http://www.sailfishfirmware.com/doc/install-installing.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Sailfish</a>. I haven't personally used this, but I've heard many great things for people who enjoy tinkering with their machine(s). Alternatively, there are 3D-printable attachments for your extruder that allow you setup markers to <a href=""http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:77424"" rel=""nofollow"">color your filament</a> (mentioned by Tom in another answer).</p>

<p>I'm worried that 3d printed objects (FDM) would degas under high vacuum. Is that an actual concern?</p>
"
"<p>I'm considering purchasing Filabot or some similar filament maker.</p>

<p>What kind of plastic can I use to produce my own filament? Can I use any type of plastic or just specific printable filaments? Can I also mix different types of filament together or only one type at a time?</p>
"
"<ol>
<li><strong>No fire.</strong> Acetone is highly flammable. Avoid open flame, smoking, soldering etc. near acetone or acetone fumes. Be ready to fight a fire.</li>
<li><strong>Ventilate.</strong> Acetone is very volatile so the fumes will be everywhere in the room. While bathing them should not kill you, it is certainly not good for your health. It may cause drowsiness or dizziness. It is also a good idea to close the container/jar as soon as possible and do not keep it open when not necesery.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid eye contact.</strong> Acetone causes serious eye irritation. IF IN EYES: Rinse cautiously with water for several minutes. Remove contact lenses if present and easy to do – continue rinsing. Seek medical help if needed.</li>
</ol>

<p>You should also avoid skin contact; repeated exposure may cause skin dryness or cracking, but this never happens me if I wash my hand after using acetone.</p>
"
"<p>It makes a difference where I live, and I'm not in a particularly humid climate (California).  When printing with wet filament, you'll sometimes hear it popping and see steam coming out of the extruder (it's usually only this extreme with nylon).  With most other filaments, when they're wet, the extruded filament will have small bubbles in it and the surface finish of the parts will be rougher, with breaks in the layer lines.  It can also lead to more oozing and stringing.  Air print a few centimeters of filament and look at it closely to see if there's any bubbles, if not, it's probably dry enough.  Whether the filament absorbs enough water to be noticeable in a few hours, in a day, or in a week depends a lot on the filament (and I assume the humidity too).  I'm mostly noticed problems with nylon, ABS, and NinjaFlex, less with PLA and PETG (though I avoid leaving any filament out for more than a day).</p>

<p>If you're not seeing any difference between, then I wouldn't worry about it.  Storing filament dry is a hassle.</p>

"<p>In addition to the aforementioned enriched filaments which give an excellent result, ABS can be plastered , painted and even chrome plated.</p>

"<p>I would recommend using a raft on your print.  A raft is a few layers that are printed on the bed before your print starts. </p>

<p>The larger you make the raft the stronger the center of it will be.  The edges may warp, but the inside where your print is will be fine.  Using a raft that is mainly comprised of lines instead of solid surfaces would allow a smaller chance of warping as it could only warp with the lines.</p>

"<p>Normally you should check and follow guidelines provided by filament manufacturer or please contact them for more details. It can vary as not all environments are the same. For example frequent temperature fluctuations can increase chances of making a filament turn brittle.</p>

<p>For example <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polylactic_acid"" rel=""nofollow"">PLA</a> can be easily transfigured at temperature ranging from 55-70°, so it should not be exposed directly under sunlight for an extended duration<sup><a href=""http://www.botfeeder.net/faq.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">faq</a></sup>.</p>

<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyvinyl_alcohol"" rel=""nofollow"">PVA</a> specifically is a water-soluble filament, so keeping it dry is absolutely necessary, because when it gets wet it can become unusable. Therefore when possible, keep them in original packaging (a sealed bag with a dessicant packet) as long as possible.</p>

"<p>Contrary to what the other answers suggest, the risk of fire is <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJWhfpWlGFg"" rel=""nofollow"">not that great</a>. An acetone ""explosion"" is even more unlikely, since you need a ratio of 2.5%-12.8% acetone vapor to air for that: too much acetone (as would be the case inside of your smoothing vessel) and nothing happens, too little (as would be the case inside of a badly ventilated room) and nothing happens either.</p>

<p>Note that even if you were working in a completely non-ventilated, ridiculously small 1m^3 room you'd still need to evaporate over half a liter of (liquid) acetone to reach that bare minimum 2.5%. In any case, well before you got into the ""danger zone"" the air would become unbreathable.</p>

<p>So, then what should you be mindful of when using acetone?</p>

<ul>
<li><p>It can give you a headache. Avoid breathing the fumes and ensure adequate ventilation.</p></li>
<li><p>You may opt to use gloves, as skin contact should be avoided (acetone can irritate the skin and possibly be absorbed through the skin). However, limited skin contact isn't a big deal: acetone is an ingredient in some nail polish removers.</p></li>
<li><p>Acetone is heavier than air, so if you use a sufficiently high container fewer fumes will escape.</p></li>
<li><p>If somehow a fire does start, it will likely be limited to your container. Having a lid handy allows you to starve the fire of oxygen, harmlessly putting it out.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>All in all, smoothing using acetone is not very dangerous. Acetone isn't suspected to be carcinogenic, though it isn't something you should be careless around either. The risk of starting a fire is small. On the other hand, solvents like MEK (used for smoothing PLA) aren't as nice by far, and should only be handled with a respirator.</p>

"<p>Is there any regulation against a 3D printed weapon in the United States or Europe?</p>

"<p><strong>Sort of.</strong></p>

<p>Fully plastic guns are banned in the United States by <a href=""http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/STATUTE-102/pdf/STATUTE-102-Pg3816.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">the Undetectable Firearms Act</a>, because <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/14/fashion/the-rise-of-3-d-printed-guns.html"" rel=""nofollow"">they can pass unseen through metal detectors</a> - a huge problem. One way around this is to insert a slip of metal into the gun, thereby making it detectable by metal detectors. 3D-printed guns made of metal - were that possible - would not violate the law.</p>

<p>The UFA was originally enacted in 1988, extended from 2003 to 2013, and then again until 2023. It may seem a bit unnecessary, as all-plastic guns, like the famous Liberator have structural issues that make them extremely difficult to fire when compared to a normal all-metal gun. However, then <em>can</em> be used.</p>

<p>In Europe, gun laws vary widely by country. <a href=""http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/ALL/?uri=CELEX:31991L0477"" rel=""nofollow"">The European Firearms Directive</a> is the main international agreement on gun laws, but its application varies, and it does not directly address 3D-printed guns.</p>

"
"<p>Here's just a few of the things you might want to look into.</p>

<p>plastic - some plastic types are more stringy than others and there's also variation between brands and colors.</p>

<p>moisture in filament - water turning to steam tends to cause the extruder to ooze when it isn't printing, which can cause stringing.</p>

<p>temperature - too hot or too cold can cause stringiness.</p>

<p>retraction distance - not enough retraction can leave some nozzle pressure, causing it to ooze during travel moves (not sure how much retraction speed matters but I suspect it can make a difference too).</p>

<p>acceleration - if it's too slow it's more likely to draw out strings.</p>

<p>travel speed - faster travel speeds are more likely to prevent strings or make them thinner and less of a problem.</p>

<p>z-hop - raising the extruder on travel moves makes stringing more likely.</p>

<p>wipe - a longer wipe distance can be helpful to reduce stringing, especially with some of the more stringy filaments.</p>

<p>combing - avoiding passing over open spaces can reduce stringing in some cases</p>

<p>part cooling fan - more cooling might help to reduce stringiness.</p>

<p>There are other things too, the extruder design makes a big difference with longer bowden tubes being more challenging to tune.  The order in which the layers are printed can make a difference too in some more specialized cases.</p>

"<p>I have an 3d printer that uses ABS filament. The software I use will generate vertical supports for my objects before printing that can be easily broken off after they have been used during print to hold sharp angles up that would normally fall.</p>

"<p>I use normal wet/dry sandpaper and it works just fine. If I remember correctly, I usually start with 220 and then work my way up to 400, 600, and 800.</p>

"<p>I'm going to 3D print a part that needs to meet certain strength requirements, due to its usages. I know how strong a particular plastic (eg. comrpessive/tensile/shear strength) is when dealt with in a solid chunk, but not when it is 3D printed. What is a good way to estimate the change?</p>
"
"<p>Especially for smaller parts, I would suggest looking into electroplating.  You can get a really nice, copper, nickel, or even gold finish using it.</p>

<p>The biggest issue is that to electroplate something, it must be conductive, but there are many conductive paints on the market which you can use to apply a very light coating to make the plastic conductive. I heavily suggest priming well (2-3 coats) before applying the conductive paint, as it will help to minimize the amount of conductive paint needed.</p>

"<p>I have a bunch of solutions to this problem but I'm always looking for additional ideas. I usually start by slicing as much as possible off with a hobby knife. The more than can be removed before sanding the better.</p>

<p>For big prints I like big <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B001449TPS"" rel=""nofollow"">generic sandpaper sheets</a> from the hardware store.

"<p>For ABS I use a gel super glue (<a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B003TP2TBQ"" rel=""nofollow"">Loctite is my current favorite</a>), it seems to slightly melt the ABS parts together and makes for a great bond. A slurry of old scrap ABS and acetone also works well, though I find that it will evaporate even if left in a closed mason jar over time. The small nozzle applicator and the fact it doesn't seem to evaporate makes super glue the better choice for me. </p>

<p>The gel super glue works ""OK"" for PLA but I've had parts fail after taking a small tumble. I just started using this <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B003HNFLMY"" rel=""nofollow"">acrylic cement</a> for PLA. It cures <em>very</em> fast but seems to slightly melt the PLA in the same way the ABS options do.</p>

<p>For internal seams I like to put a bead of <a href=""http://www.mcmaster.com/#7518a61/=10nnkbd"" rel=""nofollow"">""high performance"" hot glue</a> over the seam. It's just a bit flexible and seems to do a good job taking drops. </p>

"<p>In most cases, you should be fine with ABS or PLA out of an airtight container. If you're worried about it, throw a few desiccant packets where you store your filament.</p>

Questions about general maintenance and upkeep of printers.
"<p>It's hard to tell without actually testing the part. There are many ways you can 3D print a part, even on the same machine, that can yield different results.</p>

<p>Here are some tips to help uphold strength requirements:</p>

<ul>
<li>Identify where your stresses are and avoid allowing the natural ""grain"" of the print (ie each layer) to coincide with the stresses of the part. For example, I just printed a part with hinges today. I set my part up to ensure that the circular profile of the hinge on each layer, instead of having the machine ""bridge"" the circular profile.</li>
<li>Make your part more solid by increasing the infill. Note that somewhere around 35% won't really provide much more strength than say 50% with a standard infill pattern (ie hexagonal, diamond, catfill). However, I would imagine that if a spherical infill pattern was ever designed, that would be the strongest.</li>
<li>An easy way to beef up small areas of a part is to increase your shell variable (how many profile layers for each layer). Again, referencing my hinge design, I made sure that my hinges were completely printed using shell instead of shell/infill.</li>
<li>Don't be afraid to do some post-processing such as adding epoxy(ies) in high-stress areas.</li>
</ul>

<p>If it's not an expensive part to print, I would suggest playing with some of these ideas yourself and conduct controlled tests to see what setups work best for your application(s).</p>
"
"<p>As with any manufacturing process, you'll need to learn to ""use the right tool for the job"". It depends on the requirements of the part. To answer your question, I would suggest using a larger layer height for the sheer fact of reducing print time on larger objects.</p>

<p>However, it depends on the part and how small the details are on the part. If your part has sharp edges that are required for the proper functionality of the part, then you'll want to use a smaller layer height. Or if your part fits into another part, you'll probably want to use a smaller layer height.</p>

<p>Another variable might be whether or not post-processing is necessary. Is this part going to be purposefully printed larger/rougher with the idea to use a Dremel later to smooth everything out? If yes, then use a larger layer height.</p>

"<p>The only thing I can think of off hand is an old mod for the early MakerBot machines. It first was released for the Thing-O'-Matic I believe, but is compatible with Replicator 1 machines (and its knock-offs). Here's the <a href=""http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4056"" rel=""nofollow"">Thingiverse page</a>, but look up Automatic Build Plate.</p>

<p>Essentially, you can use the Replicator G slicing program and there is a setting for ""ABP"" or Automatic Build Plate. This will basically tell the ABP to run its routine after the controller receives the response that the printing program is done and roll the finished part off the edge of the build plate, then start the same program over again.</p>

<p>Drawbacks:</p>

<ul>
<li>I don't think it's easily compatible with newer machines/slicers. But, it's open source</li>

"<p>An option that might be feasible for some situations (depending on your setup) is <strong>Sequential Printing</strong> - a feature provided by some slicing software, for instance <a href=""http://manual.slic3r.org/advanced/sequential-printing"" rel=""nofollow"">Slic3r</a>.</p>

<p>In short, this allows you to print multiple objects <strong>one at a time</strong> rather than simultaneously. This has some obvious benefits, but also some downsides:</p>

<p><strong>Benefits:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Each object is finished individually, and you will therefore not have multiple half-finished prints <em>when</em> something goes wrong. </li>
<li>No particular printer or bed swapping mechanic is needed.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Downsides:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>With most consumer printer, print area is somewhat limited, and sequential printing requires you to place objects so that the hot end can move freely between the finished objects, potentially restricting the effective usage of your print volume.</li>
<li>By printing objects one at a time, you limit the natural print cooling that happens when printing multiple objects at the same time. In particular for smaller prints, you might not want to print sequentially unless your print cooling solution is up for it.</li>
<li>Requires some setup</li>
</ul>

<p>You specifically mention that you would like the finished prints to be moved outside the print area. In it self, sequential printing does not do this for you; however, if you fit your printer with a large, motorized print bed, you might achieve the same effect without moving into unfamiliar technology!</p>

"<p>Food safety is a property of both the process and the material. You can't stick food-safe material in a printer that has previously been used to print something food-dangerous and expect the result to be food safe.</p>

<p>The only way to know if a given material is food-safe is to ask your supplier, but a lot depends on how you then process it. For instance, FDM printers often have brass nozzles, which contain lead. To print food-safe materials, you need to use a stainless steel nozzle.</p>

<p>Food safe materials can be identified by mean of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_safe_symbol"">an universal symbol</a>.</p>

<p>Moreover, to ensure food-safety of a 3D printed model you may need to further process it (for instance, by vapor smoothing or coating with a food-safe lacquer). Some claims circulate on the internet that 3D printed models may have surface porosity in which bacteria can grow, but I've not been able to find a reliable source for this claim. Still, you need to be cautious.</p>
"
"<p>I believe the <a href=""http://manual.slic3r.org/first-print/first-layer"" rel=""nofollow"">Slic3r Manual</a> summarizes this quite nicely:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A thicker layer height will provide more flow, and consequently more heat, making the extrusion adhere to the bed more. It also gives the benefit of giving more tolerance for the levelness of the bed. It is recommended to raise the first layer height to match the diameter of the nozzle, e.g. a first layer height of 0.35mm for a 0.35mm nozzle.</p>

"<p>So, as you say you want to materials for printing robotics parts. And as you have not given any budget constraint, I would give you a list of materials which would help you achieve the task, and you can choose amongst them accordingly.</p>

<ol>
<li>Plastics: Basically used for building prototypes. Nylon Polyamide should be a choice for you.</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>Polyamide 3D printing is achieved through SLS 3D printing. It offers
  strong and flexible prints. The upside of this material is that the
  printing technology requires minimum preparation of the 3D file before
  printing. There is no need for support. And it also offers the
  possibility to create intricate shapes and moving part in just one go.
  After the print the polyamide can be polished and dyed.</p>
</blockquote>

<ol start=""2"">
<li>Metals: Metals like Brass, Alumunium and Steel should be a good choice.</li>
</ol>

<p>But, if I were to achieve your task, I would select carbon fiber. some details about it:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Carbon fiber consists of 90% carbon atoms, each fiber is 10 times
  thinner than a human hair. Carbon is especially prized for its lack of
  combustibility and infusability but also by its incredible strength
  (stronger than steel) and ability to create flexible structure, light
  weight and corrosion resistance. Its melting temperature is 1500, this
  heat there are only carbon.</p>

"<p>Filaments that are intended for making parts that require strange should be rated by the manufacturer for strength and flexibility.</p>

"<p>You will likely not see a noticeable improvement by upgrading from a 16x or 32x to a 64x or 128x microstepping driver. Depending on the motors you're driving and the size of the load you could actually see a decrease in quality.</p>

<p>Although microstepping increases theoretical resolution it does not necessarily increase accuracy. The reason is that microstepping significantly limits the incremental torque of the motor. This means that you may ask for a step but not get one because the torque of the step won't be enough to actually turn the shaft.</p>

<p>As an example: a motor running in full steps will have 100% of its rated holding torque. Moving to 16 microsteps/full steps drops this to ~10%, 128 drops it to ~1%.</p>

<p>The practical effect of this is that in high torque situations (such as printing at fast speeds) the motor may end up skipping some of the steps. In this way the increase in resolution can actually lead to a decrease in accuracy (smaller steps but they may not actually be taken).</p>

<p>A relevant calculation to do would be to work out what the different number of microsteps to full steps works out to in terms of horizontal, vertical, or whatever movement the motor drives. You can do this by measuring how far the stepper moves said surface in one revolution provided you know the number of steps it takes per revolution.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong> </p>

<p>With no microstepping: 1 turn/inch * 200 steps/turn = 200 steps/inch or .005 inch/step (127 micron resolution)</p>

<p>With 16x microstepping: 16 * 200 steps/inch or .0003 inch / step (8 micron resolution)</p>

<p>In this example 128x microstepping would be absolutely foolish. Every situation is different and you should use this information to make a decision based on your setup. Many manufacturers have recommendations on how far their motors can be microstepped.</p>

"<p>The stepper motor itself does not.  You may want to inspect the motors for debris or dust.</p>

<p>Depending on your configuration you may want to check on parts of your printer that connect to your stepper motor such as shaft couplings, pulleys, lead screws/threaded rods and belts.  The stepper motor wires should occasionally be inspected for wear and strain.</p>
"
"<p>Regarding the sturdiness of the final print, I believe it depends on the inter-layer adhesion of the filament itself - which varies greatly. Also, normally, thicker layers would increase the strength of the print up to a certain point. </p>

<p>An informal study of strength/layer height ratio can be found <a href=""http://my3dmatter.com/influence-infill-layer-height-pattern/"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>: this study suggests that the strength of the print increases up to a layer height of 0.25 mm, and then stabilizes. </p>

<p>On the other hand, printing at high resolution often will hide defects that occur from bad quality filament, in particular filament that has degraded by absorbing too much moisture. Due to the less amount of plastic extruded per layer at high resolutions, some general printing defects also tend to be less pronounced and easier handle afterwards.</p>

"<p>I'm interested in finding online APIs where you could perform a call to some third party service with some print preparation request with my model (i.e. ""heal a model"" or ""set up support"") and get in return GCODE file I can send to a 3D printer.
My input will be :</p>

<ul>
<li>The 3d model (obj, stl)</li>
<li>My printer (makerbot, ultimaker, whatever) or a printer profile</li>
<li>A printing profile</li>
</ul>

<p>This is opposed to all the classical 3D printing processes we have right now. Currently when printing in a 3D printer you would need to go through these phases:</p>

<ol>
<li>Create/Download a model</li>
<li>Prepare the model for printing with some 3rd party desktop software</li>
<li>Export the model as gcode</li>
<li>Save the file to some flash drive</li>
<li>Plug the flash drive into the printer</li>
<li>Print the model with the printer interface</li>
</ol>

<p>I would like to know if this process can be simplified to a point where you can just print your model directly from your web browser without going through all these steps.
I know I'm over simplifying things here, but I would still want to see if solutions like I suggested exist?</p>

"<p>It would be possible and not too terribly difficult to rig a servo or solenoid with a push plate like a plow, on top of your build plate. </p>

<p>However this would require another processor via raspberry pi or arduino to control it. Scripting execution when the print has completed wouldn't be terribly difficult either, but it isn't readily available and certainly isn't part of a mass produced printer. </p>

<p>My issue with the concept is if you push a bunch of prints off the build plate, what guarantee do you have they wont become damaged in the process?</p>
"
"<p>The patents that cover Lego bricks have expired, so you are free to print bricks using the same interlocking system. You are even allowed to offer such prints commercially.</p>

"<p>There are printers designed for medical use, and the manufacturers supply them with varying levels of <a href=""http://www.medicalplasticsnews.com/opinion/passing-the-test_1/"" rel=""nofollow"">certification and testing</a>, however I've not seen a filament manufacturer certify their material as bio-compatible separate from the printer. The printing process changes the material slightly in the best case (and significantly with poor temperature control or badly set parameters), so even if bio-compatible filament were found, the resulting product might not achieve the same level of bio-compatibility.</p>

<p>If your intent is to use hobbyist level machine for medical purposes, you might simply want to use an interface, such as a sock or a molded/cast polymer that you know to be bio-compatible between the printed part and the skin.</p>

"<p>No. Such figures are generally covered by copyright, which means that nobody but the copyright holder is allowed to (re-)produce copies of the work. Copyright also covers personal use. In the US there are limited fair use exceptions but they do not apply here.</p>

"<p>I would like to print edible cookies or ornamentation for a cake.</p>

<p>Is printing with edible materials achievable by standard thermoplastic-like 3D desktop printer? Or you need to buy a special printer to do that?</p>
"
"<p>If a person is running a print shop where there are given STL files by customers, and they print the part for them, does the legality of the printed object matter?  The customer would be supplying the file so the print shop would not know if it was legally obtained (or even what the object is).  Could the print shop get in trouble with the law for this?</p>
"
"<p>You can, but that doesn't mean it's very easy.</p>

<p>You don't have to buy a special printer, but you need a special extruder (such as <a href=""http://www.structur3d.io/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.structur3d.io/</a>). Most of these systems can print anything with the consistency of Nutella. However, many parts of the printer may not be food safe.</p>

<p>Another option (if you simply want 2d designs) is something like the <a href=""http://www.pancakebot.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">PancakeBot</a>. It can probably also ""print"" with anything that has the same consistency of pancake batter.</p>
"
"<p>You cannot print edible models using a ""standard"" consumer 3D printer without first installing an ""hot end"" capable of depositing edible - normally thicker - substances as well as a suitable extruder mechanism. </p>

<p>However, there are not necessarily any technical limitations in the electronics, software, slicers etc. in a typical printer that wouldn't allow you to install such an upgrade. For instance, you could calibrate your extrusion rate and nozzle width to suit batter and similar.</p>

<p>Some commercial printers, such as the <a href=""http://www.personalfab.it/en/products/deltawasp-20-40/"" rel=""nofollow"">DeltaWASP</a> allow for upgrades that print clay, which wouldn't be very different from printing liquid food.</p>

"<h3>Food Contact Substances</h3>

<p>There are regulatory agencies in most developed countries that regulate food containers.  In the USA, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates <a href=""http://www.fda.gov/Food/IngredientsPackagingLabeling/PackagingFCS/ucm2006853.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">Food Contact Substances (FCS)</a> which are materials that come into contact with food during production, manufacturing, storage, packing, and use.</p>

<p>They have many lists of FCS which are either approved for use, generally recognized as safe, regulated, restricted, or otherwise already evaluated and for which they have recommendations.</p>

<p>It is up to the manufacturer to ensure that FCS are safe, so the liability rests with the person making the 3D prints.  If you make something that looks like a cup and could be confused with a cup, you may be responsible for following these guidelines.</p>

<h3>US FDA regulation for ABS and PLA</h3>

<p>The FDA has an online resource to help guide manufacturers through these lists, <a href=""http://www.fda.gov/Food/IngredientsPackagingLabeling/PackagingFCS/RegulatoryStatusFoodContactMaterial/default.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">Determining the Regulatory Status of Components of a Food Contact Material</a>.</p>

<p>Within this, for instance, you will find the list for materials that are appropriately regulated indirect additive, under which you'll find where polymers are listed, <a href=""http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?node=pt21.3.177"" rel=""nofollow"">21 CFR 177</a>.</p>

<p>Part 177, INDIRECT FOOD ADDITIVES: POLYMERS</p>

<p>Notably, PLA is not present in this section, or any other list that I've searched (but a more thorough search may prove productive).</p>

<p>ABS is included here, in section 1020, which I've quoted below. Whether your filament manufacturer is following this ABS formula or not is something you will have to determine for each ABS supplier you use, though. Additives, colorants, and other ingredients may make a specific ABS non food safe, according to the FDA.</p>

<h3>Regulation globally</h3>

<p>The <a href=""https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/sanco_foods/main/?event=display"" rel=""nofollow"">EU has a database</a> for this, though without some industry specific experience it appears difficult to search. For instance, rather than listing ABS as an item, it lists the three monomers that constitute ABS seperately, so you have to read through the Acrylonitrile section, the butadiene section, and the styrene sections seperately to understand the food safety aspects of ABS.</p>

<p>Of course someone has gone to the trouble of parsing all these different regulations in different countries and created a book that summarizes much of what you can glean from individual databases, <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B00W53IY8K"" rel=""nofollow"">Global Legislation for Food Contact Materials</a> J S Baughan but it's not an inexpensive resource, and needs constant update so may need to be repurchased each year to keep up with the latest legislation worldwide. It would, however, be a handy reference and starting point for a hack space or library for makers.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>Keep in mind that these are regulations formulated by government bodies.  They may have a scientific basis (and hopefully they all do) but they do not replace your own testing and common sense.  Even if you follow these regulations, you may still be liable for any unsafe objects you create.</p>

"<p>I am going to address the air issue as it is currently unresolved. the third dimension offers <a href=""http://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/a/15/188"">a great answer for common safety issues</a>.</p>

<p>The short answer is that based on our limited knowledge at this point, there may be imperceptible health hazards related to <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fused_deposition_modeling"">FDM / FFF printers</a> and therefore additional safety precautions are, in my opinion, necessary and not optional or secondary as suggested by some in the community.</p>

<p>In other words, if you can isolate your printer in a well-vented area where people rarely go, then of course it's not a health risk, but if people will be exposed to the air of the printer for any significant periods of time, you need to do something about it. This is my situation - where I live dedicated workshops and extra rooms are luxuries that most people do not have.</p>

<h1>Realistic Chance of Being Dangerous --> Treat It As Dangerous</h1>

<p>The key information at this point in time is <a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1352231013005086"">the UFP (Ultra-Fine Particle) study</a> that is linked in <a href=""http://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/a/12/188"">Tom's answer</a>.</p>

<p>Leaving out the scary / detailed parts:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Therefore, results herein suggest that caution should be used when
  operating these 3D printing instruments inside unvented or unfiltered
  indoor environments due to their large emissions of UFPs.</p>
  
  <p>One important limitation to this study is that we have no information
  about the chemical constituents of the UFPs emitted from either type
  of 3D printer [...]</p>
  
  <p>[...] there may also be
  differences in toxicity because of differences in chemical
  composition.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This means that although many processes release UFPs (the authors of the paper compare to cooking), all UFPs are not created equal. Since the UFPs from 3D printing are still an unknown, the only real answer from a safety perspective is to treat them as dangerous.</p>

<hr>

<h1>This is not legal, safety, or professional advice!</h1>

<p>I am not qualified to give an opinion on what should be done but I will share what I would do:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Venting</strong> - Active airflow pushing the envelope of air around the print into a large, unpopulated body of air.</li>
<li><strong>Enclosure + Venting</strong> - By fully enclosing your printer, it will probably keep the UFPs mostly within the enclosure. You could combine that with either continuous venting or as some have suggested purge venting before opening the enclosure.</li>
<li><strong>Enclosure + Filtering</strong> - A filter can be applied both to the vent to reduce the output of UFPs (e.g. if you have no access to a safe body of air) and as a recirculating system that removes the UFPs from the body of air within the enclosure.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>A note on <a href=""http://www.silverstonetek.com/techtalk_cont.php?area=en&amp;tid=wh_positive"">positive vs negative pressure</a></strong> related to venting and filtering: if you produce positive pressure within the enclosure, you are going to be blowing all the UFPs out into your environment anyway. Negative pressure vented to a safe body of air or neutral pressure with good seals and recirculated filtering may avoid that.</p>

<p><strong>A note on filters</strong>: Activated carbon filters will not remove UFPs. HEPA filters may remove 3D printing UFPs.</p>

<hr>

<h1>Which Printer?</h1>

<p>As long as the uncertainty exists, I predict that as the market matures, filtering and enclosures will become more standard. At this point in time, the only enclosed AND HEPA filtered consumer-grade FDM printers I am aware of are the <a href=""https://www.3dhubs.com/3d-printers/up-box"">Up! Box</a> and the <a href=""https://www.3dhubs.com/3d-printers/zortrax-inventure"">Zortrax Inventure</a>. There are a number of enclosed printers without filtering.</p>

<p>As an alternative, at least <a href=""http://www.3dprintclean.com/"">one company</a> has appeared with products targeted at those who are concerned about various safety aspects of 3d printing.</p>

"<p>In my experience building with smaller layers also makes bridging and overhangs more pronounced and less likely to fail. </p>

<p>The smaller layers allow gradual changes for overhangs that are more abrupt with thicker layer. </p>
"
"<p>There are two aspects to this question that probably should be addressed separately.  This is not legal advice and I'm not a lawyer, so consult with an experienced IP attorney.</p>

<p>Copyright law may apply, and other IP laws, such as patents and trademarks, may apply.  They each have different requirements and restrictions.</p>

<p>Notably, IP law varies from country to country.  WIPO has made significant inroads into regularizing IP law across many countries, but this answer will still focus on a US-centric reading of US IP law.</p>

<h3>Copyright law</h3>

<p>It's already established that printed works, such as photographs, texts, and similar works will result in prosecution against the person and the company that the person outsourced the copying of the copyrighted work to.  Attempt to copy a book or copyrighted photo at a paper copy shop and they will typically refuse to reduce their liability.</p>

<p>Even if you show that you have rights to the work, through educational use laws, for instance, they may still refuse because they may be putting themselves in danger of a lawsuit by a particularly aggressive copyright holder.</p>

<p>This applies to 3D printing shops in a similar manner.  If you don't know the source of the 3D model, and that the person has a right to the model, you may find yourself liable for copyright infringement.  Even if you are sure, a lawsuit can financially ruin your business if it comes from a large corporation.</p>

<h3>Patents</h3>

<p>Patents apply even if you were unaware of them.  So any model you print that contains patented techniques, technology, or concepts may also pull you, as the print shop, into a lawsuit for patent infringement. </p>

<h3>Reducing liability</h3>

<p>A suitable contract with the person requesting the 3D print, as written by an IP lawyer, may reduce, but not eliminate, your liability. It won't completely absolve you of all responsibility, but may reduce your exposure to such lawsuits, and give you some leverage in court should someone prosecute you.</p>

"<p>MakerBot Industries had a mod available for their early open source machines called the Frostruder. It was basically a syringe connected to your print head.</p>

<p>I like to relate 3D printing as ""A hot glue gun on rails"". The beauty is that a lot of the home machines can easily be almost anything on rails.</p>

<p>So, you could always try to 3D print a solution of your own. Please keep in mind any federal regulations on food processing materials (ie ABS is not recommended for most food applications).</p>
"
"<p>There are many factors, here are a few things to check:</p>

<p>I'd first suspect filament feeding.  This type of ridging can be caused by a filament coil that is binding occasionally, or a filament that doesn't have an even diameter or volume per length.  Binding within the filament feeder and feeder tubes can also be a cause. Bubbles in the filament, or sometimes a mismatch between the filament ideal temperature and the head temperature could create results like this, but it probably wouldn't vary so much between the layers.</p>

<p>Next I'd look at the print head.  If it has blockages, or poor temperature control this could result.</p>

<p>Lastly, I'd check the mechanisms - disconnect the motors and see if all the carriages slide smoothly without any binding, particularly the Z axis.  It doesn't look like you're missing steps, but binding here may result in greater backlash, which could result in similar ridges. Make sure any belts and gears are tight.</p>

"<p>In my slicing software (Slic3r) some of the vertices/walls of my model seem to have disappeared, so that the inside of the model - which should be solid - is visible, while the surface appears as a thin shell.</p>

<p>Why does this happen? Is it still safe to export the model for printing?</p>
"
"<p>Almost all of the FDM materials outgas even at normal atmospheric pressure, and, in fact, most plastics outgas.  Further, FDM and many other printing processes do not guarantee no internal voids - meaning that putting a 3D printed object into a vacuum may result in breakage, cracking, and possible explosion hazards.</p>

<p>For this reason I would focus only on SLA, as the model is printed within the liquid resin pool and should have a reduced possibility of internal voids.</p>

<p>Finding a resin that has a low out-gas rate after curing, though, is still going to be difficult. </p>

<p>For this to be answered more completely, you need to specify your tolerable outgassing rate, and the processes used inside the vacuum chamber.  For instance the answer would be completely different if you are discussing an electron microscope vs a sputtering chamber. As a start you might consider companies that specialize in <a href=""http://www.boedeker.com/outgas.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">engineered materials intended for vacuum use</a>. They may be able to provide guidance as to which of their materials might be 3D printed and usable in your setup.</p>

"<p>I'm interested in designing &amp; 3D printing as a hobby (e.g. printing chess sets, small toys for family etc.)</p>

"<p>Having performed a quick search through all the resources at the FDA Food Contact Substance resource, I cannot find PLA in any list except an occasional notification that a specific manufacturer has obtained approval for use in specific circumstances, with the notice that such notifications are only valid for that manufacturer and cannot be used to validate another use of a substance.</p>

<p>There are companies that have received approval for their specific formulation and use of PLA as a food contact substance.  You may wish to discuss this further with your material supplier to find out if they have approved PLA product available.</p>

<p>Without specific product approval, though, PLA is not on the lists of generally recognized as safe, nor approved for food contact use.</p>

<p>Regulations in other countries may differ, so you may want to search the EU directives, for instance, to find out their opinion on PLA as an FCS.</p>
"
"<p>Regardless of whether the actual filament you are printing is marked as Food Safe by the provider, remember that actually printing the filament might contaminate it. </p>

<p>If you previously have printed a toxic filament on your printer, you cannot be sure no remains of that filament are deposited onto the model. Equally, I believe very few printers only consist of parts that are all marked as Food Safe - the parts that touch the filament that is.</p>

<p>Another aspect of food safety is your ability to properly clean 3D printed objects. Due to the highly structured surface of 3D printed objects, I would not be certain that they are truly clean after washing, particularly since many plastics cannot be cleaned in a dishwasher.  </p>
"
"<p>As others have pointed out, PLA isn't specifically not food safe, but materials that have been printed previously can contaminate the PLA.</p>

<p>Additionally, anything 3D printed is extremely porous. Once a part is used for food, moisture and bacteria will accumulate in the pores, and can never be completely cleaned out, contaminating any food that contacts it. It can't be sterilized either, because the temperatures needed for sterilization would deform or melt the plastic.</p>
"
"<p>My understanding is that this occurs when the object is not a true solid. Since an STL holds the triangulation of each face and spline, the slicing engine is not ""smart"" enough to determine if there is a gap in the model and therefore if it should be filled in and how. When the slicer encounters a gap, it will either treat the endpoint as the end of the feature or navigate to the next point on the layer, resulting in either gaps in the print or extra inclusions that don't make sense.</p>

<p>I've noticed that my models will fail as a true solid when I use complex solid tools such as Union, Subtract, and Trim. A lot of times there will be a rounding error in how these tools interact with the solid model that will result in a small (sometimes not very small) gap in the outer shell of the solid model. When exported to an STL, the gap is retained. </p>

"<p>Here are few things to consider from my point of view</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Printing technology</strong></p>

<p>The first thing that you need to take into account is printing technology. The most common[citation needed] right now is Fused Filament Fabrication. ""Liquid light-sensitive resin"" is being used in Stereolitography and Digital Light Processing - the SLA printers I found are less common and more expensive than FFF ones.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Price</strong></p>

<p>Bigger allows you to print bigger things. You need to ask yourself how big things you really want to print. Remember that 3d printing is quite slow process - how often you will want to print big things that will take 60hrs+ to finish?</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Printing materials</strong></p>

<p>What kind of materials you want to print with? Some materials will need higher temperatures so check the max hot-end temperature, some will require heated bed.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Assembled or DIY kit</strong></p>

<p>You can usually get kits for self-assembly cheaper than Ready-To-Print machines. However, it will require additional skills (i.e. soldering), tools and time to assemble. I am not sure if I would buy DIY kit for commercial use, but as an enthusiast I immensely enjoyed putting my Rostock Max together.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Reviews and reputation</strong></p>

<p>It is generally safe to buy printer that already has some users. Beware of new magical Kickstarter printers which will ""change the 3d printing forever"".
Reddit /r/3dprinting suggests that your new printer should meet 3 criteria:</p>

<ul>
<li>Printer passes the youtube test - has lots of youtube evidence that this particular printer is working.</li>
<li>Printer is out of the pre-order phase. This means that all pre-orders have been delivered.</li>
<li>Printer has a reputation of working well among current users.</li>
</ul>

<p>I found it to be a very good set of rules.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Upgrade capabilities</strong></p>

<p>That's very user-dependent, but this point is very important to me. I want to be able to change and improve certain parts of my printer. Check if you can switch the extruder, replace the hot-end etc. </p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Support</strong></p>

<p>I think one of the most important points. See if you can find a forum for your printer and how active community is. It will be immensely helpful if something goes wrong (and it will).
Also, company support is very important. What will happen if you need a replacement part or your printer will stop working altogether?</p>

<hr>

<p>This list is definitely not complete.
There are many more things that might be taken into account like configuration (delta or XY), multiple extruders, closed cases etc.</p>

"<p>One of the biggest questions you should ask yourself is: What is your end goal? </p>

<ol>

"<p>I'd say polarity and voltage are the biggest things -- about all you can do is double- and triple-check everything; then check again....</p>

<p>Be very careful about where you feed in 12V power (mainly for heaters and fans), vs. 5v (for the Arduino). </p>

<p>In many cases I found it unclear which way +/- went going <em>out</em> from the board (the <em>inputs</em> on my boards were at least marked clearly!). I found that if I plug in a limit switch connector backwards, that connects 5v straight to ground, which will probably make your power supply cut out (assuming it's properly protected -- otherwise it could potentially catch fire). Stepper motors, on the other hand, just run the wrong direction if you plug them onto RAMPS backwards (good design!).</p>

<p>Another thing to watch for only comes up if you're powering the Arduino via USB (I do that a lot, since I'm plugged in anyway to send files and such). A short can try to draw too much power from USB. In that case my Mac shuts down USB and gives a message; I don't know what would happen with other hardware.</p>

<p>I have heard that plugging a stepper-driver board onto RAMPS backwards is likely to fry a board, and that plugging or unplugging a stepper motor while powered is also risky. But I haven't messed those up yet, so I don't now for sure. :)</p>

<p>I may be overly cautious, but I never leave the power supply plugged in when I'm not around.</p>

<p>Best wishes!</p>

"<ul>
<li><p>Polarity matters, sometimes. Be especially mindful of the wires from your power supply to the board, as getting those the wrong way around will definitely cause damage. Heated beds and extruders are not polarity sensitive, and can go in either way. Fans are polarized, but will probably survive if you get them backwards - they just won't run. Stepper motors don't care about polarity, flipping the connector around just makes them run backwards.</p></li>
<li><p>Take special care with endstops. The endstop connectors have 3 pins (VCC, 5V and signal), endstops with 2 pins are usually connect to GND and signal. Putting a 2-pin endstop across 5V and GND will destroy the 5V regulator.</p></li>
<li><p>A common cause of damage is wires not being clamped in their respective terminals properly. The offending wire will arc, melting and destroying the connector. Tighten down screw terminals properly, use proper crimps if you have them. Soldering the ends of wires going into screw terminals is not encouraged, but if you do solder the ends then make sure to check after a while and tighten the screws again.</p></li>
<li><p>Put the stepper drivers in the right way around.</p></li>
<li><p>For things like the heated bed and wires going to your power supply, use sufficiently thick wires. Especially with the heated bed, a lot of current flows through the wires and flimsy wires will heat up and melt.</p></li>

"<p>I upgraded to an Mk9 dual extruder, and it came with thermocouples installed instead of the thermistors I had before. </p>

<p>No matter what I did with the thermocouples, the indicated temperature jumped around by as much as 30C or more. In short, after several weeks of fiddling I never got the thermocouples to work well, and replaced them with thermistors, which have been fine.</p>

<p>So my question is: what is required to get thermocouples to give reliable, consistent, accurate readings? Are they just incredibly touchy?</p>

<p>Some things I tried include:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Of course, one must add circuitry (typically a thermocouple amplifier board such as <a href=""http://wiki.ultimaker.com/Thermocouple_Sensor_Board_v1"">http://wiki.ultimaker.com/Thermocouple_Sensor_Board_v1</a>), to convert the tiny voltage differences to larger differences usable with Arduino or similar analog inputs.</p></li>
<li><p>Place those boards close to the thermocouples, but far enough that they are at pretty stable temperature themselves.</p></li>
<li><p>Have absolutely no wire extensions of splices, changes of wire types (material), etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Avoid doing repeated measurements too fast.</p></li>
<li><p>I replaced a thermocouple board with 5V through a potentiometer to the analog input pin, to rule out problems in the Arduino, pin configurations, or software, and got stable readings.</p></li>
<li><p>I checked for shorts-to-ground from the heater block, both sides of the thermocouples, the heater itself, etc. None found.</p></li>
<li><p>The thermocouple wires are surrounded by a braided shield (not common or shorted to either thermocouple wire); I tried grounding that at either end and at both ends, to the heat block, the printer frame, the power-supply ground, and the RAMPS board ground. These had various effects (sometimes large), but I couldn't find any configuration that made the readings stable (much less accurate!).</p></li>

"<p>There are a few different approaches I've seen which you could look into.</p>

<p>The easiest and most common is multiple extruders, each with a different color of thermoplastic. Tools like Pronterface and Slic3r have built-in support for multiple extruders. With multiple extruders you can get one color per extruder; there's no clear way to mix colors and get a color between the input materials' colors.</p>

<p>Another, more complicated approach is to use a single extruder with three inputs, like <a href=""http://www.aliexpress.com/item/Diamond-hotend-Prusa-i3-Extruder-Full-kit-E3D-V6-Brass-Multi-Color-Nozzle-3-IN-1/32516521911.html"">this one</a>, where thermoplastic from the three inputs can be mixed in varying amounts to get color gradients between the input colors. With red, yellow, and blue filament, you could get a rainbow of colors...albeit without any control over value (white to black) or saturation (bright vs dull color).</p>

"<p>As with many topics in 3D printing, there can be many variables that produce this result.</p>

<p>Immediately, your images make me think that the belts on your machine are not tight enough. This can cause noise in every direction of movement and is more prominent in backlash areas. I would suggest going through your general maintenance checklist:</p>

<ul>
<li>Replace Build Plate tape</li>
<li>Level build plate (An uneven plate or improper height can yield these results as well)</li>
<li>Teach your axis belts</li>
<li>Clean/lube guide rails</li>
<li>Clean drive gears</li>
</ul>

<p>Keeping up on your maintenance (I do mine about every 5 prints) should reduce noise in your motion and ensure better quality prints, mechanically speaking.</p>

<p>As mentioned above, your results may be caused by your BP being leveled too low (or too high). If your build plate height is off, the filament will not adhere to previous layers very well (if too low) and can cause this back and forth ""spaghetti noddle"" effect on outer layers. If the build plate is too high, you might see the nozzle physically ""spreading"" the previous layer around as the nozzle digs into the layer.</p>

<p>Another possible fix for this would be to play with the settings in your slicing engine that involve the order that shell/roof/floor layers are printed. ie Start inside-out or start outside-in.</p>

"<p>Some things I've tried that have helped:</p>

<p>Lay down a layer of masking tape. Most people who do this use blue painter's tape. The plastic should stick nicely during printing, yet release reasonably easily when you remove the print from the heated bed.</p>

<p>Lay down a later of Kapton tape. The principle is the same as masking tape, but Kapton tape has a smooth surface and is more durable than masking tape. The down side is Kapton tape is far more expensive, and applying it correctly is a LOT more work, since you have to use water and you have to keep bubbles from getting underneath it.</p>

<p>Put some ABS scraps into a bottle of Acetone, and allow the acetone to break down the ABS til you have a slurry. Spread this slurry as evenly as possible across the build plate, and allow the acetone to evaporate away. This leaves a thin film of ABS on the plate, and will release much better than if you print directly onto the build plate. I recommend using clear ABS if you can, since some of it will stick to your print and clear will be the least visible. You'll need to re-apply it regularly, since it will come off with your print where it touches the build plate. <strong>WARNING</strong>: Use proper ventilation and avoid contact with acetone. That stuff's not good for you. Also it's flammable, so keep a fire extinguisher nearby.</p>

<p>I prefer the ABS/acetone slurry method, but it requires good ventilation and a handy fire extinguisher. Also note that you don't have to print in ABS to use an ABS/acetone slurry; I print primarily in PLA and it makes no difference.</p>

<p>I've also heard of others using a glue stick or some other surface treatments that allow for good adhesion during printing while still allowing for easy removal.</p>

"<p>You can try using a raft with a bottom that is not 100% solid.  Something with lines or crossing lines will lessen the contact area with the bed making it easier to remove.</p>

"<p>A tool that you might find useful for experimenting with acceleration is <a href=""http://prusaprinters.org/calculator/"" rel=""nofollow"">RepRap Centrals Acceleration Calculator</a> (at the bottom).</p>

<p>By setting an <em>acceleration</em>, <em>length of travel</em> and <em>target speed</em>, you can see:</p>

<ol>
<li>The theoretical speed that can be achieved during the travel with your set acceleration (yellow line).</li>
<li>The time required to reach your target speed, and for how long it will hold that speed before slowing down (blue line).</li>
</ol>

<p>For instance, setting <code>acceleration = 3000, length = 30 and speed = 150</code> it will take somewhat less than 5 seconds to reach the desired speed of 150 mm/s, while that same acceleration theoretically could give a speed of 300 mm/s. </p>

<p><strong>Calculating speed, acceleration and jerk:</strong></p>

<p>In many cases your printer will have some limitation in maximum speed or settings given by your provider that can be used as a starting point. If not, trial and error is the most straightforward way of doing it. </p>

<p>I would separate speed calibration into three task:</p>

<ol>
<li>First find the <em>maximum speed</em> your printer can tolerate. One way of doing this is to print an object with long travel distances, and vary the maximum travel speed.</li>
<li>Using the calculator above, increase the <em>acceleration</em> for various traveling distances until you get suitably smooth acceleration curves for your desired speed for medium to long traveling distances.</li>
<li>Adjust your <em>jerk</em> setting to allow for quick speedup on short traveling distances. Jerk speed is the speed that the printer will immediately jump to before taking acceleration into account. With a jerk of 20mm/s, the printer will make an immediate jump from 0 to 20 mm/s, and thereafter speed up to the desired speed by following the acceleration profile.</li>
</ol>

<p>As a rule of thumb, it might be smart to then set the actual speed, jerk and acceleration approximately 20% below the the maximum found as a safeguard when printing. </p>

<p>Also, bear in mind that <a href=""https://www.google.no/search?q=stepper%20motor%20strength%20curve%20NEMA%2017&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=985&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi74aLL46fKAhVIdCwKHdJbDa4QsAQIGg&amp;dpr=1#imgrc=NbUjFTxiWehyKM%3A"" rel=""nofollow"">the strength of stepper motors lowers for higher speeds</a>, so that the nozzle will not hold its path very well if obstructed.

"<p>The thinnest wall your printer can print is determined by its nozzle size, and will be a little thicker than that nozzle size.</p>

<p>A great challenge when dealing with thin, hollow cylinders is that the cross-section has very little surface area and it can delaminate easily, especially if the tube is long.</p>

<p>You could try printing the tube with a very thick extrusion with, and using only a single perimeter. That would give better gas-tightness and layer adhesion than two, thinner perimeters, but it may turn out too fragile for your application. In that case, you'll need to print additional perimeters. Sticking to thicker extrusion widths would still be beneficial.</p>

<p>At a two centimeter diameter I'd say the single perimeter has a decent chance of working if you handle them gingerly.</p>

"<p>As Tom pointed out, binary search is the best way. In case that term isn't familiar to all readers, here's a little more detail:</p>

<p>1: establish an acceleration value that you're sure is too low (call it ""L""), and one that you're sure is too high (""H""). It sounds like you know such values already from experience.</p>

<p>2: figure out the speed in the middle: (L+H)/2.  Call that ""M""</p>

<p>3: Try printing at speed M. Something like a stepped calibration cube might be a good choice of object (plenty available on thingiverse).</p>

<p>4: If M is still too fast, take M as your new high-speed limit (that is, reset H to the value of M), and repeat from step #2.</p>

<p>5: If it's slow enough to work, take M as your new low-speed limit (L), and repeat from step #2.</p>

<p>Each repetition will cut the range in half. Keep repeating until L and H get as close as you want; say, within 5% of each other or so.</p>

<p>I wouldn't bother trying to get super-close, because the workable value will vary somewhat over time (friction from dust getting on various parts; slight voltage differences; different mass and pulling tension for the filament roll, temperature of motors, complexity of the object you're printing, behavior of the slicing program you use, you name it).</p>

<p>Hope that helps.</p>

"<p>Lubricating the filament is the most common solution I've heard of to stop filament jams and clogs. Lubricating makes for a smoother ride through the print head. While you're at it, make sure that the filament is clean. The best way to stop jams from dust is to get rid of the dust in the first place.</p>

<p>Some people recommend <a href=""http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:103729"" rel=""nofollow"">canola oil</a>, which I've heard works reasonably well for both ABS and PLA (though especially for PLA). You can even <a href=""http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:52203"" rel=""nofollow"">3D-print dust filters/lubricators</a>, if you think this could be a serious issue.</p>

<p>I personally try to clean the print head regularly, after every couple prints or even after each print, if I have time. Something sharp, like tweezers, can pick off bits of filament near the tip of the nozzle. I haven't tried other utensils yet, but there are certainly other tools that would work. I've also heard of people regulating temperature with a fan, in order to prevent partially melted bits of filament clogging up the inside of the nozzle, but I don't know if that's effective.</p>

<p>In some cases, the problem could even be as mundane as a support issue. I once set up a spool of filament, only to have a jam when the support for the spool failed, leaving the line of filament tugging at the nozzle and clogging it. Taking steps to prevent this from happening can be simply and effective. Whatever the cause, preventative measures are always my choice.</p>

"<p>I am reconfiguring a Printrbot Simple Metal that has been retrofitted with a RAMPS+Arduino Mega running Marlin, with a fairly slow feedrate due to mechanical and quality limitations.</p>

<p>I am finding that upon cancelling a print where something goes wrong, I have a long period of time in which the printer is continuing to print from the G-code and movement buffer, although the host software (Octoprint) has long stopped sending G-code.</p>

<p>Is there a way I can either a) configure Marlin to have a smaller print buffer (since Octoprint has no trouble keeping up with the printer as it stands) or b) send a particular signal or G-code to the printer that stops it without continuing to read buffer contents?</p>
"
"<p>Marlin does allow one to change the size of the buffers, in <code>Configuration_adv.h</code>. In the current version there's an ifdef that switches between two cases, one with SD support, and the other without. Both have a movement planner of size 16, which can be adjusted.</p>

<p>Additionally, in the same file, <code>BUFSIZE</code> can be changed to modify the size of the buffer storing <em>unparsed</em> commands before they are parsed and enter the movement planner buffer.</p>

<p>Additionally, for some firmwares, <code>M112</code> will immediately shut down the printer, no matter what is in the buffer, but the reset button will need to be used, and the axes will not be homed afterward. In Marlin, it's hardcoded to call <code>kill()</code>.</p>

"<p>The thinnest possible will be a single outline, so the best you can possibly do is slightly larger than your nozzle size.</p>

<p>The biggest issues I see in terms of making a thin airtight tubes are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Complex geometry: anywhere you have overhangs you may need to increase the wall thickness to ensure a sealed overlap.  Bridging will need extra layers to ensure good layer adhesion and any supports will have to be removed carefully to not damage the surface.</li>
<li>Perimeter start/end: The joint where the perimeter starts/ends not only has to seal to the layer below but it has to seal with the now cooling start point.  This could be especially problematic if all of your layers are started at the same point (which visually produces a vertical seam) because you don't have a smooth perimeter on the previous layer and any imperfections in the joint are compounded.</li>
</ul>

<p>Thoughts:</p>

<ul>
<li>Print on end where possible: You'll get a higher quality outer perimeter if your layers are full rings instead of printing up both sides of a pipe on its side.</li>
<li>If you can manage a single perimeter when printing on end try using the ""spiral vase"" setting, which will smoothly raise the z position and print as a spiral instead of printing discrete layers.  This removes any issues related to sealing the start/end of a perimeter.</li>
<li>If you're printing with multiple perimeters increment the wall thickness in multiples of the nozzle size to ensure the perimeters are sealed together.  Having the perimeters not bound together increases the chance of leaks and reduces stiffness.</li>
<li>Do the pipes have to have the same thickness all along them?  You can probably reduce thickness to save material for simple geometry (straight sections) if you change thickness gently.</li>

"<p>I would say that <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fused_deposition_modeling"">FDM</a> printing in general is out of the question for this task, ABS and PLA would both melt in the oven, and the grooves in the print from the FDM process would make it a nightmare to clean.</p>

"<p>In most cases, removing the old filament from the printer, inserting the new filament in, and running the new filament through the printer for a short period of time will clean the nozzle.  The skirt of the print can also be a time during the actual print for the old filament to be flushed.  Assuming the skirt is long enough, all that needs to be done is the new filament inserted and the print started.</p>

"<p>The biggest problem I see with using a Kossel (or any FDM printer) is that to print the mold directly you'd need a plastic with a low enough melting point you can print it and a high enough melting point you can bake it.</p>

"<p>If you feel you need to <em>clean</em> the nozzle the best approach is a <em>cold pull</em>.  You can perform this procedure with many printers, however, you should seek advice from your printer manufacturer before attempting this process if you have any doubts.</p>

<p>With the previously filament still loaded and the tool head cold:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Begin to raise the temperature of the tool to the printing temperature of <em>the next filament you intend to load</em></p></li>
<li><p>As it begins to warm up perform any tasks you normally perform during filament unloading (open the idler, for example). <strong>You should not be fighting against the extruder drive gear or any other part of the tool during this process!</strong></p></li>
<li><p>With a fair amount of pressure begin pulling on the filament</p></li>
<li><p>The old filament should eventually release from inside of the tool leaving the end of the filament roughly in a nice molded shape of the inside of the tool.  Begin loading the next filament you intend to print and manually feed some filament through as the tool finishes heating</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Anything left over from the previous filament including pigment or other residue should be stuck to the end of the filament.</p>

<p>You can perform <em>cold pulls</em> as many times as you wish by loading new filament, extruding a small amount, letting it completely cool and repeating the steps.</p>

"<p>I have a strange issue with my heated bed. It has been working well for a long time, but recently it has developed an issue where the temperature reported by the thermistor will occasionally jump by around 10 degrees.</p>

<p>My setup is a 600W, 240V silicone heater mat, with integrated 100k thermistor, that is switched with a solid state relay. The mat is fixed to a 4mm thick aluminium plate. It seems unlikely that these fluctuations are due to bad PID tuning since the reported temperature changes much more quickly than is physically possible.</p>

<p>I've checked the wiring, tried using a different thermistor port and making sure the connector was properly plugged in, but to no avail. The fluctuations are brief enough that they don't cause any problems when printing, but I'm worried about the issue getting worse.</p>

<p>I have a RAMBo board 1.1b, and I've tried using both the integrated 5V SMPS supply and an external USB supply.</p>

<p>The issue is not limited to the start of printing, the temperature reported can be stable for a long time before the issue pops up. The issue also occurs during cooldown (further confirming that PID has nothing to do with it):</p>

"<p>A Delta printer requires constant complex calculations to produce straight lines while printing.

"<p>It really looks like either a bad thermistor or bad electrical joints. Are the connections to the thermistor itself crimped, or soldered? Are there connectors near the thermistor that can get heated up by the bed?</p>

<p>Electrical connections that are mechanical in nature (such as crimped, or using a connector) can degrade quickly in heated situations, particularly when the heating is intermittent.  Consider replacing crimped connections with soldered joints where possible, and where not possible use gold plated connectors and crimps to avoid oxidation issues. Oxidation and poor mechanical connections will change resistance based on movement, giving you apparent increases or decreases in sensor readings even when the sensor output is unchanged.</p>

<p>Chances are good that the thermistor itself is fine, but that the connection nearest the thermistor, between the wires and the thermistor, is faulty. If it's crimped, you may be able to simply add flux, then solder it to increase the bonding between the wires and the thermistor and decrease future issues with oxidation.</p>

<p>Note that soldering is really only useful for the thermistor on the bed.  The head thermistor must be crimped, as the head temperatures can exceed solder temperatures depending on the target temperature and the solder alloy.</p>

"<p>Auto speed is calculated from maximum volumetric speed in mm<sup>3</sup> per second. If you normally print at 80 mm/s, your extrusion width is 0.5 mm and you are printing 0.2mm high layers, your volumetric speed would be 80 * 0.5 * 0.2 = 8 mm<sup>3</sup>/s, which is the volume of plastic extruded by your printer every second when printing at that speed (not accounting for any die swell).</p>

"<p>I think the closest you're going to get is with a composite material. Over the last 2 years or so, there have been more and more composite filaments emerging on the market for consumer 3D printers. I good example of composite filaments can be seen on <a href=""http://www.proto-pasta.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">Proto-Pasta</a>. Since the filament must mostly be comprised of the polymer ""binder"", the material will obviously not exhibit all the properties of both.</p>

<p>Without getting into too much Material Science, consider the composite of both ABS and Iron (or some other ferrous-based metal). You cannot expect to print a solid circuit out of the filament because the iron may not be represented throughout all directions of the filament, therefore resulting in resistance or flat out non-conductivity. </p>

<p>So, to answer your question: I'm not aware of a significantly larger glass state in a type of metal/alloy. Your best bet is a composite, but it depends on the requirements for your part if a composite will work. Then, you'll have another battle of finding the right type of composite and worst of all, a good supplier lol</p>

"<p>I believe casting typically uses a wax for the positive when using casting sand. So, I would suggest using <a href=""http://www.machinablewax.com/product.php?product=52"" rel=""nofollow"">wax filament</a> in your 3D printer.</p>

<p>I would try to shy away from hard polymers like PLA/ABS/Nylon (all typical 3D printing filaments) if the goal is to ""melt it away"" because a certain amount of the plastic material will either bind itself with the metal or large chunks of plastic will cause inclusions in your part. Both of these side effects will potentially degrade the quality/strength of your part.</p>

<p>I haven't personally used wax filament, so I can't tell you what the correct setting are. However, you can get most of the necessary information from whichever supplier you go through.

"<p>I am designing a part that has to clamp around a 11mm bushing, and due to other design constraints, it has to be printed with a semicircle-shaped overhang:</p>

<p><a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/LcLSm.png""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/LcLSm.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>This is proving very challenging to print. Two copies of this part have to clamp tightly around the bushing in all directions. Support material is rather hard to remove from the very top of the arc (where the overhang angle is the highest) and I often end up removing just too little of the support material (so the part doesn't fit around the bushing) or too much (and the bushing can wobble around).</p>

<p>Is there any way I can modify the design of this part (bearing in mind that it absolutely has to be printed in this orientation) to make it more tolerant of my inaccuracy when removing supports, or is there perhaps some way to manually design supports that are easier to remove (Simplify3D and Cura both don't quite cut it)?</p>
"
"<p>If your printer is printing support material that is too strongly attached, you can increase the space between the support and the part in some slicing softwares. On Cura it is located in the ""expert settings"" menu (you can open it by pressing Ctrl + E), under the ""Support"" text. Try fiddling with the ""Z distance"" setting until you find the right setting. You can also change the type of support and support infill amount and see if it have any positive or negative effect.</p>

<p>Edit : I think you should also redesign your part : it seems that it cannot lock the bushing on. The semicircle should be a bit smaller to have a bit of space between your two parts. This way the bushing will be secured firmly by the tightening force of the screws and precision should be less of an issue.</p>
"
"<p>I think a lot of this depends on the slicing engine you're using as to what options you have. I use MakerWare (now MakerBot Desktop) which has many options for the support scaffolding as well as other useful settings for your situation. As someone else stated, adjusting the distance (even slightly) can make a world of difference in how easy the supports are removed. Also bear in mind that supports can be more difficult to remove with larger layer heights, so try printing in a lower layer height.</p>

<p>Often times, you shouldn't need to use support structures for a feature like this. I might suggest printing without supports at a reduced speed and lowered nozzle temperature. This will help ensure that the material hardens quicker, which becomes helpful higher along the arc.</p>

<p>Related to the suggestion above, you can focus your slicing setting on better bridging. This should give better control on feeds/speeds while ""bridging"" a gap between overhanging features. Some slicing engines allow you to specify a different layer height for these areas on the print.</p>

<p>So, I would try printing with reduced print speed, nozzle temperature(s), and layer height with supports. My machine has a range of 0.1mm to 0.3, but I've had more success printing between 0.12mm and 0.15mm layer height with scaffolding in mind.</p>

<p>Last suggestion (when absolutely all else fails) purchase some sort of dissolvable filament (ie PVA - water soluble) and set your scaffolding-to-part distance really close and print. Obviously this only works if you have a multi-extruder head or a lot of time on your hands to swap the materials and adjust the nozzle temperature for each layer (please don't do that...)</p>

<p>If I recycle PLA and ABS together into one strand of filament, will there be any negative side effects (e.g. reduced strength)?</p>

"<p>I moved to a plain glass heated bed with a brush applied acetone and abs mixture. Using an old emptied nail polish bottle with brush, I added some acetone and then threw in abs pieces until it reached a brush-able consistency.

<p>I just found previously that abs would adhere to my kapton taped heated bed too strongly to use, and so while this involves a little work before each print, it's overall better than kapton for me.</p>

<p>I did experiment with sheet metal beds coated with kapton, but they curl during printing due to the abs thermal stress, allowing my parts to be concave on the bottom side.

"<p><strong>What bed material cools faster?</strong></p>

<p>I found an <a href=""http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/thermal-conductivity-d_429.html"">extensive list</a> which relates various materials to their <em>thermal conductivity</em>, k [W/mK]; the lower thermal conductivity, the better the material insulates, and the slower the print bed will resist changes in temperature - both heating up, and cooling down. </p>

<p>Here are the thermal conductivity for some common materials for 3d printer beds:</p>

<pre><code>Aluminum    205
Glass       1.05
Acrylic     0.2
Air         0.024 (for reference)
</code></pre>

<p>There is also the matter of thermal capacity, but I will not go into that right now (need to do some research myself first!).</p>

<p><strong>Will bed material affect cooling time?</strong></p>

<p>Bed material, I believe, is not necessarily related to print cooldown time: it depends on the situation, such as whether we are discussing cooldown during or after printing, and if the bed is heated or not. </p>

<ol>
<li>If you are <em>not</em> using a heated bed, I believe the bed material doesn't matter at all.</li>
<li>With a heated bed <em>while printing</em>, only the first dozen layers or so are probably affected by the rising heat sufficiently that it affects the printing process.</li>
<li>With a heated bed <em>after printing</em>, the thermal characteristics of the bed will determine how quickly the print cools (and thus can be removed).</li>

"<p>Why do we have two standard filament sizes, 1.75mm and 3mm? Does it really make a difference when printing? Or is the 1.75mm just for smaller printers?</p>

<p>In what situations should I be using 1.75mm?</p>

<p>When should I be using 3mm?</p>
"
"<p>There's no appreciable difference. Just use the filament that fits your particular printer.</p>

<p>If you don't yet have a printer, then I'd get one that uses 1.75mm filament:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>1.75mm is increasingly becoming the ""standard"", thus being easier to get. Some filaments are not available as 3mm.</p></li>
<li><p>1.75mm filament allows for finer control, because feeding in 1mm of filament corresponds to less plastic extruded.</p></li>
<li><p>1.75mm filament requires less force to extrude. Compressing 1.75mm down to 0.3mm takes less force than doing the same to 3mm filament.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>However, the advantages are fairly minor. I don't see any reason to replace a functioning 3mm extruder with a 1.75mm one (yet).</p>
"
"<p>There are a few factors to consider those two:</p>

<p><strong>3mm</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>More rigid - easier to print with flexible plastics. I couldn't make my 1.75mm printer print with NinjaFlex using standard bowden extruder.</li>
<li>Can extrude faster</li>
<li>Quality is less affected by changes in diameter - it is a concern mostly when using cheap plastics</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>1.75mm</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>More popular, easier to buy</li>
<li>Needs smaller extruder than 3mm</li>
<li>Easier to use with bowden tube</li>
<li>More precise when printing</li>
</ul>

"<p>I believe the post by @tbm0115, covers many of the general options. However, I would also consider <em>installing additional fans</em> to improve cooling of the model during printing.</p>

<p>As pointed out by <a href=""http://www.desiquintans.com/coolingtests"" rel=""nofollow"">this excellent article</a>, installing a fan can significantly reduce issues the from printing overhangs. Regarding the type of fan to get, they stated that: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It seems that the fan shroud you choose is less important than the fan type. The blower fan was consistently weighted above the stock 40 mm fan regardless of shroud. Using a blower also gives you the best possible airflow through any shroud you decide to use.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In addition - in my experience - adding having two or more fans blowing on the model from different directions will further improve overhang performance. This is because all parts of the print are less likely to experience lack of cooling due to <em>wind shadow</em> - or <em>drag</em>.</p>
"
"<p>I think (as do a lot of others) that the differences are rather minor. So just my 2 things I know from experience. We've been using 3 mm for some years and now we are moving towards 1.75.</p>

<p>1.75 mm filament is very easy to entangle, especially, if it is not on spool. You can even easily create knots on the filament and it is very hard to untangle. As long as you keep it on spool and always buy on spool, you should be fine.</p>

<p>3 mm filament on the other hand, creates very high tension when the spool is about to end. Sometimes the last couple of meters are unusable because of this and you have to throw the rest of the spool away.</p>
"
"<p>As an extension from <a href=""http://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/264/when-to-use-1-75mm-vs-3mm-filament"">this</a> question, is there any reason that you would not be able to use 1.75mm filament in a printer that takes 3mm filament?  I know you would have to change the filament size in the slicing of prints but would there be any other problems?</p>

<p>Also, would using 1.75mm filament be possible if the nozzle diameter was greater than 1.75mm but less than 3mm?</p>
"
"<ol>
<li><p>It may work for a short time but you're going to fill the melt chamber quickly and possibly overflow to a point where the filament isn't constrained causing a messy jam.  All the molten plastic will likely flow backwards to a point where the diameter isn't 3mm any longer (probably next to your drive gear) but depending on the length it may just flow up, cool down and jam the extruder.</p></li>
<li><p>No, the filament would just pass through unheated and not do anything.</p></li>

"<p>I've been printing for a week now on my new printer and have been getting great results, including great adhesion. However, most of my prints have had a fairly small footprint.</p>

<p>Now, I'm stepping up the types of items I'm printing, and I've started to run into a problem. Long, thin parts are starting to lift off the bed, especially at the edges of the bed.</p>

<p>I've read <a href=""http://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/61/why-do-the-corners-of-my-abs-object-lift-off-the-bed"">the question dealing with this issue with ABS</a> and realize some (most) could apply to me. However, I'm printing entirely in PLA on a non-heated bed.</p>

<p>My question is: What is the best way to go about troubleshooting this problem? In which order should I attempt fixes to narrow down the problem most quickly?</p>

<p>Printer: Monoprice Maker Architect 3D (Very similar to Makerbot)</p>

<p>Material: PLA</p>

"<p>There are several things you could try without spending much but even PLA will warp on an unheated bed.  I had a Legacy Kossel that I switched to an acrylic bed and had many issues with warping and prints pulling off the bed.  </p>

<p>Some cheap things to try would be...</p>

<ol>
<li>Adding a brim to the print.</li>
<li>Blue painters tape on the acrylic, remove the other material if doing this.</li>
<li>Place cheap piece of glass/mirror on bed and use hairspray/gluestick.</li>
<li>Use hairspray/gluestick directly on acrylic.  You must be careful here because first layer height is very critical to prevent damage to the acrylic from the plastic welding.  A layer of hairspray or glue should prevent it but dial in your height before printing.</li>
<li>If you aren't currently using a fan, you could try sealing the sides to prevent drafts.  I doubt this would change much since you are using PLA but it's an option.</li>
<li>If these are your designs, there are steps you can take to reduce warping as seen <a href=""http://hackaday.com/2011/11/15/a-technique-to-avoid-warping-on-large-3d-prints/"">here.</a></li>

"<p>Typically an extruder and hot end are designed for one or the other, and cannot support the other without mechanical changes.</p>

<p>The extruder may not be able to grip a smaller diameter filament with enough force to assure even feeding and retraction.</p>

<p>The hot end, however, is much more complex. The filament has to be pushed with force into the melting zone, which means the filament has to slide along an area inside the hot end where the filament is plastic but still put pressure on the filament ahead of it.</p>

<p>When you put filament into a hot end, the filament softens before the melt zone, but since the walls of the hot end are just barely larger than the filament it has no choice but to continue pressing down on the liquid filament below.</p>

<p>With a narrower diameter filament, though, the filament can heat, soften, then travel <em>backwards</em> along the sides of the hot end and cool in place, jamming the hot end, or at least preventing an even continuous flow of plastic.</p>

<p>Some hot ends will accept a small Teflon tube that takes this space up and allows you to do this with fewer issues, and if you like to tinker you can experiment with this, but be prepared to learn a lot and fail a lot as you find out the hard lessons of hot end design.</p>

<p>Generally you should upgrade your entire extruder and hot end setup to the size you want to use.</p>

"<p>It sounds like EM interference to me, though Adam's points about connections are also a good bet. I would try re-routing the thermistor wires far away from other wires. If that helps, then either leave them re-routed, or shield them. In any case, please let us know what you find.</p>
"
"<p>Here are all the ways I can think of:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Turn the temperature down just a little, which may reduce sagging</p></li>
<li><p>Crank up cooling, like bigger fan(s) aimed at the print, so it solidifies faster</p></li>
<li><p>Change orientation when possible (not in this case)</p></li>
<li><p>Use soluble support material, and wash it away afterwards (requires 2-head printer)</p></li>
<li><p>Pause the print as you go up, and insert support material manually (ick)</p></li>
<li><p>Omit support material at the very top</p></li>
<li><p>Machine out the support material afterwards with a more precise tool, like a drill or sander the same diameter as the bearing. I'm eagerly waiting for a BoxZY printer that can swap in a milling head in place of the extruder.</p></li>
<li><p>Remove support material as now, but if you remove too much, fill the gap after installing the bearing to prevent wobbling -- epoxy, hot-melt glue, melted PLA, etc. might work, depending on how the part will end up being used.</p></li>
<li><p>Add a set-screw to secure the bearing</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Of course, these all have tradeoffs; but I hope at least one of them might help.</p>

"<p>You could modify it as shown in my picture.  I added lines tangent to the 11mm circle and in this example I set them to a 40 degree overhang which should be fine, the top line is also tangent to the circle and in my experience it's easier to bridge a small section rather than do a bunch of small overhangs like an arc would do.  You still end up with quite a bit of contact but also easy to print.</p>

"<h1>Safety Advice for Acetone Handling/Usage</h1>

<hr>

<p><strong><em>Please remember that you handle acetone at your own risk! By using this advice you agree to hold me harmless and not sue me as a result of using these instructions/advice. Remember that I am not a professional chemist or a lawyer (this isn't professional or legal advice)!</em></strong></p>

<hr>

<p>I encourage you to research safety precautions and risks on your own to build a personal body of knowledge. The most effective safety precaution available to you is knowledge; the brain is the most important piece of safety equipment! This listing of advice for acetone handling is generated from the highlights of a Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) for acetone. After reading this advice you should read an MSDS for acetone directly. It would actually be an excellent idea to find and read the MSDS for all the chemicals you use during 3D printing. </p>

<p><strong>Safety Equipment</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Wear safety clothing! Acetone requires that you wear protective gloves, protective eyewear, and a respirator (to protect your airway). It is also highly recommended to wear protective (ideally also chemically resistant) clothing (like a smock or an apron). These safety clothes are recommended because acetone is a toxic substance which can absorb through the skin and walls of the lungs directly. Make sure to verify the gloves are made of a substance which blocks acetone absorption, also, verify that your respirator is rated to protect against acetone (many respirators are not capable of blocking acetone due to it's volatility).</p></li>
<li><p>Possess, prepare and understand how to use an eyewash station, a fire blanket, a fire extinguisher (rated for chemical fires), a chemical shower/dousing system and other standard laboratory safety equipment. Posting warning signs along the entrances and exits to the work area about working with a volatile, flammable and explosive gas is also recommended.</p></li>
<li><p>Keep an inert absorption media readily available to cleanup spills should you accidentally fail to avoid a spill. Diatomaceous earth, silica/sand and activated charcoal are all potential absorption media. Should you have a large spill or not possess absorption media (which should not happen - always verify safety equipment is present and working before handling chemicals!) then you may also dilute the spill with water and mop up the dilute solution of acetone. No matter which method you use to cleanup a spill remember to dispose of the contaminated cleanup materials according to the requirements/laws of your local area. <strong>Do not</strong> lazily dispose of the acetone down the drain without doing research on the correct disposal methods!</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Control Your Environment</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Ensure proper ventilation of your workspace (ventilation is required in addition to your respirator due to explosion/fire risk). If the atmospheric concentration of acetone becomes too high the risk for fires and explosions quickly becomes unacceptable (the risk is never going to be zero working with acetone unfortunately, but minimizing it is very important). Working outside is the perfect way to insure the ventilation is adequate, although that presents it's own problems and considerations. Alternatives include using a fume hood, or even something as simple as a fan blowing air through an open window. </p></li>
<li><p>Eliminate any and all sources of flame or spark for a considerable area around all sources of acetone (10-15 meters minimum). Take special precautions to prevent being unknowingly contaminated with acetone (which could then be accidentally transported from the work area to a flame source using you as a carrier). Personal contamination can lead to injury if you attempt to smoke during a break or at anytime before verifying you are not contaminated. It is important to provide an ignition-free environment that extends quite far away from the immediate vicinity of the acetone because acetone can ignite a vapor trail of acetone and allow the flame to travel distances via flashing over the vapor trail. Physical isolation is the ideal solution to this dangerous problem. A policy of always closing the door to the acetone work area is an example of physical separation which would hopefully prevent this vapor trail flash-over.</p></li>
<li><p>Avoid acetone spills. Acetone is an excellent solvent which could easily eat away the paint on your wall or destroy the finish of your table. Spills also necessitate following special precautions for cleanup and disposal, which have already been provided earlier within this list. </p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Acetone Chemistry</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Do not under any condition mix your acetone with chemicals without an extensive analysis and understanding of the products and the risks associated with the reaction. The following list of chemicals will create an explosive compound/mixture when reacted with acetone, so do not allow them to come into contact with acetone: hydrogen peroxide, acetic acid, nitric acid, nitric acid + sulfuric acid, chromic anydride, chromyl
chloride, nitrosyl chloride, hexachloromelamine, nitrosyl perchlorate, nitryl perchlorate, permonosulfuric acid, thiodiglycol +
hydrogen peroxide, potassium ter-butoxide, sulfur dichloride, 1-methyl-1,3-butadiene, bromoform, carbon, air, chloroform,
thitriazylperchlorate.</p></li>
<li><p>Should you accidentally ignite some acetone, you must take additional precautions while evacuating or while attempting to extinguish the fire. Acetone is a hydrocarbon and the reaction of burning it produces products which include carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO2). Essentially, humans are incapable of detecting these gases with their senses (detectors exist to measure concentration). However, these symptoms of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide can help alert you to the fact they are present: shortness of breath, blackness along the edges of your vision, confusion, headache, unconsciousness, coma, and finally, death. Carbon monoxide is far more dangerous than carbon dioxide because often the first symptom is unconsciousness, which prevents you from evacuating, leading to death. The dangerous of gas inhalation are substantial enough that as soon as a fire becomes medium-sized you should seriously consider evacuating the area rather than staying to extinguish the fire. It is better to lose property to the fire than to die (if you die I would guess that your property is destroyed anyway!).</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Risk Analysis</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Acetone is a confirmed developmental toxin for females and a suspected developmental toxin for males as well. The risk of breast milk contamination is unknown, but it is a suspected toxic contaminant. Mutagenic and tetragenic effects are not known. The result of this toxicity is that pregnant or breastfeeding women should not handle or be around acetone (due to vapors) even for short periods of time.</p></li>
<li><p>The risk of cancer and the carcinogenic properties for acetone are not well-defined, with some declining to classify acetone as a carcinogen and others classifying it as being carcinogenic. California, for instance, has required that acetone bear a proposition 65 warning about cancer risk.</p></li>
<li><p>Acetone is definitely a toxic substance, but it is not highly toxic and accidental ingestion or absorption is essentially incapable of causing severe symptoms. Small exposures to acetone (like the exposure levels likely encountered during 3D printing) are more-or-less not very harmful. However, if you do get a problematic exposure to acetone, contact a poison control center.</p></li>
<li><p>The LD50 (""lethal dose 50%"", dose where half of subjects die) in rats is 5800 mg/kg, making the predictable (humans are often similar to rats in regards to toxicity) LD50 for an adult human similarly high. With such a high lethal dose, the predicted toxicity of acetone likely causes chronic sub-lethal damage instead of causing an acute and lethal response. If we assume an average adult human (62 kg) shares the LD50 of a rat- that human would need to consume 392 cc of acetone to reach the LD50. 392 cc is nearly equivalent to 4/10 L- meaning that there is essentially no chance the small consumption of acetone caused by working with it could poison an adult human (if our assumptions are correct).</p></li>
<li><p><em>Potential effects of inhalation, ingestion or skin absorption of acetone:</em> dry skin, nausea, vomiting, skin irritation, eye irritation, burning sensation, redness, tearing, inflammation, corneal injury, depression, fatigue, excitement, stupor, insomnia, hypersomnia, ataxia, tremors, dizziness, drowsiness, confusion, headache, muscle weakness, loss of motor coordination, speech abnormalities, narcotic effects, coma, kidney damage, liver damage, brain damage, and death.</p></li>

"<p>With <a href=""/questions/tagged/fdm"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;fdm&#39;"" rel=""tag"">fdm</a> printers, the 3D object that should be printed can be positioned anywhere in the build volume. But it's only practical to place it on the bottom, because otherwise support material would be necessary.</p>

<p>stereolithography has the same problem. Even though the photopolymer can be cured at any position in the build volume, the result would drift away if it was not held in place by support material.</p>

<p>The powderbed based printers (either powder+binder or any of the laser/electron beam sintering/melting variants) do not have this problem, because they continuously fill the entire build volume with powder. The support material that other printing technologies require is part of the powder based printing anyway. It would be possible to pack the build volume with many prints and print them in one go.</p>

<p>Given that the machines are relatively expensive, it would be economical to increase the throughput. A company that does use such printers heavily could wait a certain amount of time until a few print queued up that fit together in the build volume and only then start the process. Do people do this?</p>
"
"<p>Yes, this is very popular. Look into the site Shapeways and you will see that this is exactly what they do. I've also personally seen a local 3D print shop do this with their machine. It's called batching. I similar technique can be used in traditional machine shops (mills/lathes).</p>
"
"<p>The print speed for powderbed printing depends primarily on the height of the print; the lateral extent doesn't really matter.  Since powderbed printing provides its own easily-removed support structure, a packing that maximizes the number of items and minimizes the height will maximize throughput.</p>

"<p>E3D hotends use a thermistor whose legs are insulated with glass fiber sleeving and clamped down with a screw and washer:</p>

<p><a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/IAJDy.jpg""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/IAJDy.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>This solution enables the printing of high temperature materials, but it's a bit fragile and after reassembling the hotend a couple of times, the screw will have thoroughly mangled the thermistor's legs and sleeving.</p>

<p>Some knockoff E3D hotends use a (horrible) solution where the thermistor is just loose in its respective hole, and kapton taped to the heater cartridge wires which holds it in place:</p>

<p><a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/xMsxq.png""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/xMsxq.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>This solution seems kind of ad-hoc, and I'm worried about the thermistor coming loose. One advantage is that it can be reassembled arbitrarily often, since just pulling out the heater cartridge also pulls out the thermistor without damaging it. Note that the picture shows PTFE sleeving which restricts the temperature, but you could easily use fibreglass in this situation as well.</p>

<p>Another solution is the stud thermistor:</p>

<p><a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/ER2gr.jpg""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/ER2gr.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>It screws into the hole that is normally used for the clamping screw. Unfortunately you're limited to around 250C because of the epoxy used in the stud. I've also found that the epoxy fails after a while (regardless of temperature) and the thermistor isn't locked in place any more (it still works, by virtue of being constrained by the heater cartridge wires as in the previous solution but that's not ideal).</p>

<p>Are there any solutions, compatible with genuine E3D hotends, that:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>are not limited in temperature by epoxy or PTFE,</p></li>
<li><p>can withstand being disassembled and reassembled better than the standard fiberglass sleeving,</p></li>

"<p>It looks like the hotend may not be all the way in, are you sure it's not stuck?</p>

<p>If it's stuck and you can get it in further, those holes should go directly through the smaller ring on top of the J-Head.  You just need to run a machine screw into each hole to secure the hotend. The screw will need to at least be flush with the other side to work correctly.</p>

"<p>I know that melted polymers are used for DLP (digital light processing) printing, by displaying the model onto the liquid material, which is the melted polymer.</p>

<p>But, can I use materials like steel, carbon fiber, etc?</p>

<p>If yes, then what precautions and arrangement should I make to my apparatus for coping with their high melting point?</p>
"
"<p>DLP doesn't use ""melted polymer"". It uses a photosenstive resin which is at room temperature and polymerizes when exposed to (UV) light. At no point is any material melted.</p>

<p>As such, steel or carbon fiber can not be used as these materials are not photosensitive.</p>

"<p>I've played with v1.2.9 only a little bit (I primarily use MakerWare). However, it looks as though you can just go to <code>Print Settings -&gt; Speed -&gt; (Modifiers) First Layer Speed</code>. Here you'll have the option to set the speed in <code>mm/s or %</code>. If you're having issues with the first layer (or two) not adhering very well to a raft, try reducing the distance between the part and the raft. Mine looks to be a default of 0.2mm. This can be adjusted from <code>Print Settings -&gt; Support Material -&gt; (Options for support material and raft) Contact Z distance</code>.</p>

<p>Please note that the closer the part is to the raft, the more likely the part is to sticking to the raft once it cools. So, I would recommend being close by as the part finished so you can quickly remove the raft before it cools with the part. It become especially more difficult with PLA because it becomes hardened during the print process, therefore resulting in a more catastrophic material failure if any part of the object is broken (such as a raft).</p>

<p>I'll also note that I primarily use MakerWare for my machine and v3.8 has made it much easier to apply these types of settings. It's similar to Slic3r's interface and no longer in a JSON file that pops up. Through the MakerWare interface, you can navigate to <code>Settings -&gt; Custom -&gt; Extrusion Speeds -&gt; First Layer</code> to adjust the print speed. You'll also notice that there is a separate option for <code>First Layer Raft</code> that ensures that the two values are separate in the post-processer. I believe it still may be possible to use MakerWare for a non-MakerBot machine, just export the file to GCode and you should be able to load it directly into your machine via SD card or possibly even Slic3r (it might change some of the code though).</p>

"<p>I generally agree with the points in masteusz's and Tom van der Zanden's answers, but I would add a bit more detail. Generally, the differences are minimal, however:</p>

<ul>
<li>Generally speaking, a 1.75mm filament will make it easier to use a smaller nozzle diameter (&lt;0.4mm), allowing for more precise prints in some cases.</li>
<li>1.75mm filament will give you better flexibility with flow rates as it has a higher surface to volume ratio, allowing for faster melting in the nozzle, and allowing you to push your printer to higher volume extrusion rates.</li>
<li>The converse of the above points is also usually true. ""3mm"" filament (which is usually actually 2.85mm) will allow for better control and higher extrusion rates on wider nozzle diameters.</li>
<li>1.75mm filament is indeed more popular than 2.85mm, however the smaller diameter means that manufacturing tolerances really need to be tighter along the length of the filament—a ±0.1mm difference in width along the length of your filament is only ±3.5% for 2.85mm and more like ±6.7% for 1.75mm, so you're going to have a bigger difference in actual flow rates compared to your expected flow rate set in your slicer, resulting in lower-than-expected print quality. That means you're probably going to want to spring for more expensive, higher quality 1.75mm filament in order to get good prints.</li>
<li>Your printer's hardware setup matters, too: Bowden-based printers, like the Ultimaker 2, generally have more luck with the thicker filament because thinner stuff will usually compress more in the bowden tube and create a stronger spring effect, causing extra pressure in the nozzle. This will often cause blobbing, stringing, and over-extrusion and hamper the positive effect of your retractions.</li>
</ul>

<p>Ultimately, you can tune your printer and slicer settings to create or negate most any of the differences in print quality caused by filament diameter, but you may have an easier time with certain prints and printers with one diameter over the other.</p>

"<p>It is okay to just use bare wires in the type of screw connector found on your power supply. They're designed for it; they have a little plate under the screw that prevents the wires from being frayed by the screw.</p>

<p>If you want neater wire termination, you should use one of the spade type ones. Pick the smallest size that fits your wires.</p>

<p>PC power cords are generally fitted with an IEC C13 plug, and those are rated for 10A (meaning also the wires themselves will be able to carry at least that much current). This is fine for any home 3D printer which usually draws a fraction of that.</p>

"
"<p>This is still work in progress, and here is what I have so far, but first:</p>

<p><strong>A useful alternative for similar problems:</strong></p>

<p>A problem very similar to this would be to use different settings for different parts of a model in Slic3r. For most settings, this can be achieved through <a href=""http://slic3r.org/blog/modifier-meshes"" rel=""nofollow"">modifier meshes</a>.</p>

<h1>Post processing scripts:</h1>

<p>As far as I know, Slic3r does not give you the option of setting the speed of the first layer after a raft directly, but they do allow you to run <a href=""http://manual.slic3r.org/advanced/post-processing"" rel=""nofollow"">post processing scripts</a>; that is, to automatically run a set of operations - programmed by you - on the g-code output.</p>

<p>Although far from trivial, you can in theory make a program that runs through the output g-code, adjusts the settings to your preference, and then saves it again at the target destination.</p>

<h3>Tuning overall printer speed through g-code:</h3>

<p>As it turns out, there is a <a href=""http://reprap.org/wiki/G-code#M220:_Set_speed_factor_override_percentage"" rel=""nofollow"">simple g-code command</a> that sets the overall speed of your printer's operation:</p>

<pre><code>M220 S[some number]     ; see the link above for compatible firmware
</code></pre>

<p>A <a href=""http://reprapworld.com/newletters/newsletter_4_201438.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">newsletter</a> from Reprapwold explains that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For example M220 S50 will reduce the speed to 50%
  of the original sliced G-code. If you want to hurry your print to the finish in time
  for dinner, use M220 S200, to print twice as fast (200%)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words, just like some printers allow you the change speed mid-print, you can use the M220 command to override the current speed used, either through a user interface such as PrintRun, or by fiddling with the original g-code itself.</p>

<h3>Manipulating the g-code output to adjust speed settings:</h3>

<p>The easiest way to achieve our goal would be to manually manipulate the output g-code file through a text editor, and insert our M220 command in appropriate places:</p>

<ul>
<li>Set M220 S50 just before the first <em>perimeter</em> layer (after the raft's <em>interface layer</em>), to slow down the first layer of the actual model.</li>
<li>Set M220 S100 sometime after the first perimeter layer, to resume the normal speed settings.</li>
</ul>

<p>In order to do this, though, we need to be able to distinguish these two points in the g-code output.</p>

<h3>Distinguishing insertion points:</h3>

<p>Slic3r offers a setting under <code>Print Settings -&gt; Output options -&gt; Verbose G-code</code> that - when enabled - inserts written comments all throughout the g-code files generated.  </p>

<p>If one inspects a g-code file outputted for a model with raft, one will find the comment:</p>

<pre><code>; move to first perimeter point      &lt;- lets call this A
</code></pre>

<p>and </p>

<pre><code>; move to next layer (x)             &lt;- lets call this B
</code></pre>

<p>littered several places throughout the gcode. </p>

<p>It is under my <em>impression</em> that the <em>first</em> occurrence of comment <strong>A</strong> happens right after the raft is finished, and before the actual model is being printed, while the first occurrence of comment <strong>B</strong> succeeding comment <strong>A</strong> can be used to set the speed back to normal.</p>

<p>It should be noted, however, that <strong>the comments in the output g-code does not seem fully consistent</strong>, and I would therefore not recommend anyone to automate this logic into a script without possibly finding other, more reliable breakpoints, and thoroughly verify these through several different models. </p>

<p>I have not looked into the details of writing an automatic script for this task as of yet.</p>

"<p>Most likely, the 3D-printers used on ISS does not incorporate some fundamental difference that allow them to print in zero gravity.</p>

<p>Some people over at <a href=""http://3dprint.com/62797/3d-printing-upside-down/"" rel=""nofollow"">3Dprint.com</a> raised a very similar question, and figured that when turning their 3D-printer upside down and on it's side:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>there’s not really much difference at all. It’s quite interesting to see how the orientation has little effect on the quality.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One of the early 3D-printer models - the <a href=""http://bukito3d.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">Bukito</a> printer - demonstrated that their printer was so portable it even could print on the move, and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePU4EEM3JEI"" rel=""nofollow"">upside down</a>.</p>

<p>In other words, some consumer 3D printers already print upside down, and so they would probably print in zero gravity as well!</p>

"<p>I have built a Kossel too. Got lots of tips from the Google Deltaprinter group.
Most important when using the Traxxas rod ends is to have the metal parts go into the freezer and the plastic parts in warm water(not boiling, just 60 degrees celsius or so). Then put the 2 together, due to the fact the metal crimps just a little and the hot water softens the plastic a bit, they will fit easy and will be stiff longer. These mounts tend to wear out causing play in the effector. I have printed 100's of hours on my Kossel mini with traxxas rods and still moves very nice and prints accurately.</p>

"<p>Answering this question fully depends on the type of printer you have. Some printers have a pause capability, while others do not. Some have multiple extruders, while most do not. Some have a tube leading to the extruder and others do not. You specifically are asking about dealing with more than two colors when you have a dual-extruder, but the question generalizes to how to get more colors than you have extruders.</p>

<p>Markers probably offer the easiest solution. You could have different markers on the feeds for each extruder.</p>

<p>For printers with no pause ability, you might have to snip one filament and hand feed the second color after the first one until it can be caught by the feeder gear.</p>

<p>There are rigs that are available, or that you can make, that will let you connect two strands together lengthwise. You can then make up a single piece of filament that has multiple colors. Thus, one extruder head will be generating multiple colors.</p>

<p>The Kickstarter mentioned elsewhere essentially does this automatically for several strands whose lengths are calculated precisely by special software. The result is a single strand of filament that goes into one of your extruders - the other extruder would be unused with this solution.</p>
"
"<p>To answer your question, you have to consider how the melted filament sticks to the print bed and to other layers, and if gravity has any affect on how it sticks. The answer is that gravity does <em>not</em> have any real affect on the stick-to-itivity of the filament. Instead, the plastic bonds to the print bed surface, and then subsequent layers fuse with the previous layer. Nor does gravity have any affect on how the filament is fed or how the belts and gears move. Certain filament roll holders may not be able to be used if they do not clamp the roll down, and the printer also needs to be clamped down. But, perhaps surprisingly, there isn't really anything else that needs to be done differently to make a printer work in space.</p>

"
"<p>One thing I haven't seen anyone mention yet is the issue of the size vis-a-vis time of the final print. 3mm filament allows the printer to spit out a <strong><em>lot</em></strong> of plastic at once, letting you build must taller prints much faster. Larger filament can also provide a much wider base for the next layer to rest on; smaller filament needs to print multiple times side-by-side to get the same width.</p>

<p>Of course the fineness of the layers will suffer, but you can go about twice as high in one pass compared to when you use the smaller filament. On the flip side, the smaller filament will more easily print extremely fine layers than the bigger filament. So it's a trade off.</p>

<p>Consider the printers building items feet or tens of feet in height. They use ""filaments"" that are measured in centimeters or decimeter a instead of millimeters.</p>
"
"<p>Some people use a nylon ""cleaning"" filament when switching types of filaments. It heats well to a variety of temperatures and seems to stick well to whatever is in there when pulling it back out. Be sure to heat it up to the temperature of the filament being removed to get that to bind with the nylon.</p>
"
"<p>I like the mounting method on my Mk9 extruder: there's a small hole drilled into the heat block, parallel to the heater hole. B3 Innovations sells a thermistor packaged into a small spring. The whole assembly goes in the hole, and a setscrew (gently!) secures it. You could just as well put a bare thermistor into a spring or something similar; it's mainly to protect the thermistor from the setscrew, and from excessive bending.</p>

<p>From your photo, it looks like the same thing would work fine for your hotend.</p>

<p>However you mount it, adding some thermal grease can help conduction from the surroundings.</p>

"<p>When designing parts that should either fit with external objects or other printed parts, what measures can one take to ensure that the dimensions of the final print are accurate and fit the other object?</p>

<p>To my knowledge, you at least have two options to account for printer inaccuracy and shrinkage:</p>

<ul>
<li>Adjust the space around joints in your CAD model</li>
<li>Adjust dimensional offsets in your slicer software</li>
</ul>

<p>Are there any good workflows one can use to design and print 3D-models accurately without resorting to trial and error?</p>
"
"<p>In theory, I imagine you can, but there are some practical considerations that might need some thought:</p>

<p>If you have a desktop printer with multiple extruders, you could probably print with both one <em>conductive</em> and one <em>structural</em> filament, and thereby build circuits in 3D.</p>

<p>One concern would be the low melting points of most 3D printed filaments, since one would have to limit the heat generated by the mounted components and connections so that the structure of the ""board"" would not be melted.</p>

<p>Mounting components to the board would also differ from a normal PCB, since you would have to connect the components with the conductive filament without melting the structure of the board. In other words, you probably would have to use conductive filament as ""solder"", and melt components into place. </p>

<p>Whether you could use typical tools used for mounting SMD components with conductive filament as solder is beyond my knowledge. </p>
"
"<p>I think the best way to go about this would be to calibrate your printer and slicer as best you can.  One of my pet peeves is when people upload STLs that have been adjusted to fit their printer/material.  There are many suppliers of material that vary in quality as well as many materials and different printers that the tolerances shouldn't be built into the part because in the end it usually just makes it harder for others attempting to print the model.</p>

<p>If you aren't sharing models then all I can say is you are still better off to calibrate your printer and tune your slicer to your material.  You'll have more luck with models from other people and have an easier time designing your own.  </p>

<p>If you still have trouble then modifying the model is probably the last option.  I don't know of any CAD programs that can work with problems 3D printers have so experience is going to be your only help.  I know in Inventor you can go around and Thicken/Offset individual surfaces of the model to compensate or if you had a percentage for your shrinkage you could get creative with formulas in the sketches.</p>
"
"<p>I think it's important to remember that a 3D printer is both an R&amp;D tool and a piece of manufacturing equipment. As such, we should treat it and it's process similarly to other pieces of manufacturing equipment (ie mills, saws, etc.). Other (albeit traditional) manufacturing methods such as a mill will typically require post-processing to parts to remove any burrs and clean the parts. Since tools like a mill are a subtractive technology, it can already hold tight positional/dimensional tolerances. However, as 3D printing is additive manufacturing, it's difficult to hold the same tolerances directly out of the machine as compared to traditional tools.</p>

<p>For this reason, I would suggest planning time for a more traditional process after the print if tolerances and connections are a concern. This could be as simple as using a Dremel or using a mill/lathe. I would recommend increasing your shell/floor/roof settings in your slicer to accommodate the subtractive process though.</p>

"
"<p>I'm not certain exactly what you're asking, but I'll give this a try. If I've misunderstood, please give more details.</p>

<p>It sounds like you're upgrading to the E3D v6. If so, the heater, thermistor, and fans should connect to the same places as the previous ones did. The exception would be if you had thermocouples instead of thermistors before; that's a more complicated change.</p>

<p>If the <em>connectors</em> are different, you'll need to get matching connectors from a parts supplier (post a picture if you're having trouble identifying them). Fortunately each of the items you mentioned has 2 wires, and for the heater and thermistor polarity doesn't matter. </p>

<p>For fans, polarity <em>does</em> matter, so match up red vs. black, or just try it one way, and if the fan doesn't turn, then swap the wires. Some fans have a third wire, which could be used for measuring the actual rotation speed (see [<a href=""http://pcbheaven.com/wikipages/How_PC_Fans_Work]"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pcbheaven.com/wikipages/How_PC_Fans_Work]</a>); but it's not necessary.</p>

"<p>I upgraded to a dual Mk9 extruder, and quickly discovered how critical it is to get the ends of both nozzles exactly level with each other -- that is, equally distant from the build plate at all times. Otherwise the lower one will crash against the plastic just extruded by the higher one.</p>

<p>So, what's a good procedure for getting the nozzles accurately level? About all I've figure out is to move the heads down close to Z=0, and then run X and Y back and forth and eyeball and adjust; then move even closer to Z=0 and repeat. Is there a better / more efficient way?</p>

The author settled on 57.5%Sn, 41.3%Bi, 1.2% In, which begins to melt at 130 and finishes by about 170. This has much better viscosity after melting, so it doesn't just drip away or bead up, and whose melting point is low enough that it can be applied directly on top of PLA or ABS. Brass nozzles corrode quickly, however, so another material is needed (anodized Al was an improvement). It sounds difficult but feasible.</p>
"
"<p>There is scanning technology: either hardware or software (such software typically works from multiple 2D photographs). It has limitations, but is an active research area, and getting better all the time. ""Autodesk 123D Catch"" and ""3-Sweep"" are a couple examples.</p>

<p>One tradeoff between automatic and manual is the complexity of the shape you need to duplicate. Sometimes you can make a much simpler shape that still works, and/or thicken the part so it doesn't break the next time. That can make manual design much more attractive.</p>

"<p>eSun has a cleaning filament that extrudes at a wide range of temperatures.  It may seem ridiculous to use filament that costs over $100 USD per kilo to purge the nozzle, but it's very convenient and in practice, you don't use much each time (it's sold in 100g packs).  I'm still using some samples I received with some filament over a year ago.</p>

<p>Cold pulls will probably be more effective though (as described in another answer), they're just more effort.  I usually use cold pulls with nylon when I want to clear out my nozzle, either as part of routine maintenance or when switching to plastics that are sensitive to contamination (usually PETG or ninjaflex).  I usually use the cleaning filament when I want to change from a dark to a light or clear filament, especially if the new filament is expensive.  Most of the time I just feed in enough of the new filament to purge out the old, with the temperature set to the max of the two.</p>

"<p>In addition to the thermal issues Tormod raised, there is a conductivity issue. Present conductive filaments are much less conductive than copper. The power loss may be enough to affect functionality. Also, the lost power goes to heat, making the thermal problems worse.</p>

<p>For bulk materials, ""volume resistivity"" is measured in ""Ohm-cm"", which is the resistance of a 1 cm cube of the material, measured from one entire face to the opposite entire face (see <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_resistivity_and_conductivity"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_resistivity_and_conductivity</a>).</p>

<p>Copper has a volume resistivity of about 1.68 <em>micro</em>Ohm-cm. </p>

<p>Proto-pasta conductive PLA filament claims 15 ohm-cm (<a href=""http://www.proto-pasta.com/pages/conductive-pla"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.proto-pasta.com/pages/conductive-pla</a>). Functionalize F-Electic&trade; claims 0.75 ohm-cm (<a href=""http://functionalize.com/about/functionalize-f-electric-highly-conductive-filament/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://functionalize.com/about/functionalize-f-electric-highly-conductive-filament/</a>).</p>

<p>Printing itself significantly raises resistivity. Proto-pasta claims 30 ohm-cm along X and Y, 115 along Z. More intuitively, each cm of length of a 2.5mm wide printed trace, 0.4mm thick, should add several hundred ohms with the Proto-pasta, or several tens of ohms with the F-electric. That may be enough to matter. </p>

<p>It's probably worth mentioning that there's a specialized PCB printer (the ""Voltera"") that uses (pricey) conductive ink, and can also dispense solder paste: <a href=""http://www.computerworld.com/article/2885188/3d-circuit-board-printer-a-smash-hit-on-kickstarter.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.computerworld.com/article/2885188/3d-circuit-board-printer-a-smash-hit-on-kickstarter.html</a></p>

"<p>My Replicator (you know, the one made of balsa wood) has blown a voltage regulator on its MightyBoard for the second time. The first time, MakerBot graciously replaced it. However, they replaced with the same model board with no apparent fix for the commonly faulty voltage regulator. I can't afford the now $500 replacement board, so my option is to replace the faulty component and hope no further damage was taken on the board.</p>

<p>As MakerBot Industries did not need me to send in my old board, I've <a href=""http://coolate.com/blog/blog/2015/02/23/its-alive-makerbot-replicator-repaired/"" rel=""nofollow"">followed these steps</a> to try and replace the voltage regulator on the old board.</p>

<p>I've offset the voltage regulator towards the power jack, jumped the remaining pin on the voltage regulator to the remaining lead on the board (where the old voltage regulator was), but I'm confused what/where the green wire does/goes (mine is blue on my machine). The image looks like he just soldered it onto the heat sink pad.</p>

<p>I tried to test it by plugging in the power and the RGB LED strip. The stepper motor driver LEDs turned on, but the LED strip and none of the other on-board LEDs turned on. I'm not very seasoned when it comes to electronics, so can anyone explain what the actual pinout should be or suggest other ways to resolve this issue?</p>

<h2>Update: Old Board Replacement</h2>

<p>So far I've replaced the regulator on my old board with some success. Before the replacement, the board wouldn't turn on (on-board LEDs wouldn't turn on). Now, all of the proper status LEDs turn on, but the board seems to be stuck in a boot sequence. The LCD screen provides two lines of block characters (as it normally does when initializing), but just hangs up there. I tried connecting the machine to my PC to try and restore the board to factory settings and install the latest firmware. However, the PC couldn't find the machine and I began to smell a bit of burning. I'm not sure if this is a result of permanent damage from the original regulator failing, or improper installation of the new regulator.</p>

<p>I'm going to dig around a bit more before attempting this fix on my main board. I'll edit this post as I continue the project.</p>

<h2>Update: New Board Replacement</h2>

<p>So, I've now attempted the fix on the newest board (the reason for this question). The results of this board are the same as the old one. I actually get power on the main board, but the LCD screen just shows two solid lines. I've taken pictures of what I've done.</p>

"<p>It takes quite effort to make PLA shiny and it's not as simple as ABS and acetone. </p>

<p>You have to sand down the print with sandpaper with different grit size (start with grit 100, then 240, 400, 600, 1500 and 2000).</p>

<p>To make the shining result you have to polish the print with plastic finish compound. Alternatively you can apply XTC-3D Print Coating.</p>

"<p>One of my favorite techniques is to join pieces with screws, and include a tapered feature that helps align the parts.

"<p>A problem I have come across when using Pronterface is that the operating system starves the resources of the program if the program's window is not in the front.</p>

<p>If I, for instance, started a print, then started browsing the web, it would sometimes suddenly stop. When bringing Pronterface back to the front, it would take a few seconds, and then continue (if I remember correctly).</p>

<p>On OS X - which I am using - I believe this is called <em>app nap</em>, while a similar mechanism exist for Windows. I ended up printing form an SD card myself after this, but you might want to try manually setting the resource priority for Pronterface in your OS.</p>

<p>In Windows, you could trying to increase the resource allocation for Pronterface by going to <code>Task Manager -&gt; Details -&gt; Right click the Pronterface process -&gt; Set Priority</code>. I would be careful to set it too high, since you are basically allowing the program more juice to potentially do something wrong.</p>

<li>Make sure that the <strong>bed is level</strong>. As the saying goes, a level bed is next to godliness or something like that. Pay extra attention to the direction the nozzles are offset by (if one nozzle is offset on the X-axis, pay extra attention to the bed leveling along the X-axis). <a href=""http://wiki.solidoodle.com/leveling-the-print-bed"" rel=""nofollow"">This can be done with just one nozzle and a business card or piece of paper</a>.</li>
<li>Use a <strong>bubble level</strong> to get the nozzles about right. Move your z-axis up a bit and put a bubble level against the nozzles. Adjust as necessary so it's exactly level. The nozzles should be level enough that the bubble stays in the middle.</li>
<li>Fine-tune it with a <strong>business card</strong>. When you home the z- axis, you should be able to just fit a business card under both nozzles with a moderate amount of resistance. Don't force the card. If sliding the business card under produces a different amount of resistance for one nozzle than for another, adjust the nozzle a <em>tiny</em> amount. You can also use an index card or playing card.</li>
<li>Once it passes the card test, try a test print. If it doesn't work, make sure your bed is level, your nozzle offset is correct in the slicing software, and try calibrating with an index card again. If the nozzles become way off, try the bubble level again.</li>
</ol>

<p>As for physically adjusting the level, another answer suggests shims made from aluminum foil, which work well. Personally, my extruder was off-level by almost exactly 1mm, so a pair of washers worked nicely for that.</p>

"<p>It's also worth noting that the ratio of nozzle diameter to layer height affects strength. The layer height is typically set slightly smaller than the nozzle diameter, so the nozzle ""squeezes"" the new plastic onto the previous layer.

"<p>What's the part number of the regulator you're putting in? The pin assignments vary from one part to another, but you can probably find them from the part number online. Some parts have the ground pin also connected to a metal part of their case. The green wire from the board <em>should</em> be ground (no promises!)</p>

<p>Assuming you've got a voltmeter, you can use it to find out which pins on the board are power and ground (easiest to do before the regulator is installed...). Then once installed, check that you're really getting 5V versus ground on the remaining (output) pin.</p>

<p>Since 2 of these burned out on you, I suggest taking steps to reduce the strain on the regulator. Voltage regulators turn the excess power into heat. Some things that can help:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Use heat sink grease to conduct heat from the regulator to the circuit board, the adjacent socket, etc. Hot melt glue, as the instructions you linked to mention, won't likely provide as much heat conduction.</p></li>
<li><p>Attach a heat sink to the regulator, or a <em>bigger</em> heat sink.</p></li>
<li><p>Get more air blowing across the regulator. You could do this by moving the regulator slightly, adding a fan, adding something to redirect some air onto the regulator, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Swap in a bigger voltage regulator (that is, one rated for more current)</p></li>
<li><p>Turn down the voltage just a tiny bit on your power supply (if it has a control for that; many do).</p></li>

"<p>Two good options for ROUGH alignment:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>For threaded thermal barrier type extruders:</strong> use a leveling jig
like this while the extruders are disassembled:
<a href=""http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:23013"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:23013</a></li>
<li><strong>For straight-shaft thermal barrier type extruders:</strong> Carefully level
the bed to whichever nozzle is lower, using your preferred piece of
paper / business card / feeler gauge. Then stick the same paper /
leveling tool under the higher nozzle, release the set screw or
clamp on the tube, and drop it down to rest on the leveling tool. You can also use a printed jig if your thermal barrier tubes are stuck and need some force to move.</li>
</ol>

<p>The best and easiest way for FINE alignment:</p>

<p><strong>Shims.</strong> </p>

<p>Just stick some folded-up aluminum foil (or layers of Kapton, or whatever) under whichever end of the cooling bar is lower, and tighten the screws holding it onto the carriage. Re-adjust as needed until perfectly level. This is ten times more accurate and much easier than trying to get precision alignment of the thermal barrier tubes in the bar itself. </p>

"<p>Thermocouples work by passively generating VERY small voltages via the Seebeck effect -- usually a few tens of millivolts. They're literally just a pair of wires made from two different special alloys, electrically connected together at the ""hot"" end. That wire junction can be mounted inside whatever kind of attachment tip or lug is desired.</p>

<p>The fact that they're very simple and passive devices makes them extremely precise and consistent between TCs of the same type, MUCH more so than thermistors. Any type-K thermocouple in the world will give you the same accurate output +/-1-2C or so. You can even cut a thermocouple in half, re-twist the ends of the wires together, and it'll still work! </p>

<p>However, the very small (millivolts) signal they generate is quite susceptible to electrical noise and circuit design. The signal voltage has to be greatly amplified to be useful. So it doesn't take much EMR from your heater or stepper wires to interfere with the TC reading. A frequent problem with TC circuits in 3d printers is the dreaded GROUND LOOP -- if the ""hot"" tip is electrically connected to the hot block, voltage and current on the heater and motor wires can induce small currents through the TC wires that totally screw up the millivolt signal. The amplifier picks up these stray voltages and it throws off the temp read. So, there are some important guidelines for keeping noise out of the TC wires:</p>

<ul>
<li>The TC wires must be electrically insulated from the mounting hardware (eye lug, thermowell, whatever your extruder has). You can check this with a multimeter -- you want infinite / out of range resistance from the TC leads to the mounting tip and hot block. While you're at it, make sure your heater cartridge wires aren't shorting to the hot block -- that's unsafe and can also cause problems with TCs.</li>
<li>Keep the two TC wires close together, and not immediately parallel to noise sources like PWM-controlled heaters or stepper wiring. If you must run the TC in a bundle with the other wires, TWIST the heater/stepper wiring pairs. (For steppers, twist each coil pair to a different pitch if possible. You don't need to twist the separate coil pairs to each other.) </li>
</ul>

<p>Another common issue with TC circuits is the COLD JUNCTION COMPENSATION. A thermocouple doesn't measure tip temperature, it measures the DIFFERENCE in temperature between the hot tip and the cold junction where the TC is connected to either the amp or copper wiring. The TC amp has an onboard thermistor that it uses to add the temp at the cold junction to the measured signal from the thermocouple. There are a few things you need to do to make sure the cold-junction compensation works properly:</p>

<ul>
<li>You should run TC wire all the way from the ""hot"" tip to the TC amp. You CAN splice it and install plugs, but only with more type-K TC wire and proper type-K thermocouple plugs. These use the same metal as the TC wire so they don't generate undesired junction voltages that interfere with the TC signal. If you splice copper wire between the TC and the amp, any temp differences along the copper will not be measured! This is a particularly big problem if you splice to copper inside a warm enclosure and then run copper to an amp outside the enclosure.</li>
<li>The amp should not be super hot. The onboard thermistor is designed to accurately measure temperatures reasonably close to room temp, not hot-block temps. </li>
<li>There should not be large temperature gradients near the amp or between the TC wire termination and the actual amp chip. Place the amp far enough away from the hot end and other heat sources (like stepper motors) that it isn't experiencing weird temp profiles.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you do the above, the TC will output a good signal, and the amp will read it properly. But there's one more hitch. The mainboard has to know how to understand the amp's output. 3D printer control boards that are designed exclusively for TCs, like Mightyboards, usually use digital communication between the amp and the main control chip (MCU). This is high-reliability and does not require any special firmware configuration -- support is baked in. But if you're strapping an external TC amp onto a board that is expecting thermistors, <strong>you will have to tell the firmware how to read the signal from the amp.</strong> The most common technique is for the amp to output a linear voltage signal to the MCU's normal thermistor input (ADC). Then you configure the firmware to use the appropriate ""thermistor table"" (really a voltage lookup table) for that particular amp. Depending on your controller board, you also may need to make sure the regular thermistor pull-up/pull-down resistors aren't affecting the amp's output.</p>

<p>So you need to make sure:</p>

<ul>
<li>You don't have electrical noise issues</li>
<li>The cold-junction compensation is working as intended</li>
<li>The firmware and controller board is configured correctly for your amp chip's output</li>
</ul>

<p>If you do all that, a TC should give superior accuracy and reliability over a thermistor. </p>

"<p>That's my picture :-)</p>

<p>I use a filament monitor with an encoder wheel that pauses the print if the filament stops moving (because a bulge got stuck, or filament ran out, or the hot end jammed, or whatever).

"<p>Unfortunately, different firmwares and different slicers require different calibration techniques! There's a lot of software-specific advice out there, like printing a single-wall calibration box and measuring the wall thickness. That's a good technique for Slic3r, but not for Simplify3D. It can be very confusing.</p>

<p>Here's the general outline of what you should do:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Rough calibration check</strong> for printer steps/mm. Do the values in your firmware settings make sense for your linear motion hardware? For example, you can calculate what the theoretical values SHOULD be based on belt pitch and pulley tooth count. Print something moderately big (~100-200mm) and check if it's +/-1-2%. If it's off by more than that, your steps/mm is probably wrong.</li>
<li><strong>Check for mechanical backlash</strong> using a backlash-checking print like this one: <a href=""http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:252490"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:252490</a> Tighten belts and perform other printer-specific tuning required to eliminate backlash. Backlash will throw off other calibration steps, so make sure there's no slop!</li>
<li>Follow the recommended <strong>extrusion volume calibration</strong> steps for your slicer. This starts with measuring your filament diameter with calipers and inputting that into your slicer. And then you will usually either <em>""print a single-walled box and measure the thickness""</em> or <em>""print a series of 100% infill calibration boxes and adjust the extrusion multiplier to the largest value that looks good without bulging.""</em> By measuring filament diameter and then adjusting an extrusion calibration setting in the slicer, you will be able to measure future filament and prints will come out right. Giving the slicer fake diameter values will force you to recalibrate every time the diameter changes. Note that you must redo this calibration for each FILAMENT MATERIAL and EXTRUDER DESIGN. Different material/extruder pairs will have different bite depths and effective drive diameter.</li>
<li><strong>Precision calibration check</strong> by printing a variety of object sizes and PLOTTING ""desired size"" as X and ""actual size"" as Y. Then find a linear fit equation, y=mx+b. (Do this separately for your printer's X, Y, and Z axes.) <em>The value ""m"" is your scale error.</em> You can use your slicer object scaling to fix this. For example, ABS usually requires 100.3-101% scaling to account for shrinkage. If you have scale error with a low-shrinkage material like PLA, you can adjust your firmware's steps/mm value to compensate. <em>The value ""b"" is your fixed width error.</em> Assuming you don't have backlash, this is usually caused by the small amount that molten plastic bulges out to the sides, or by extrusion volume calibration error. You can improve this by fine-tuning your extrusion volume. Many slicers also have ""horizontal/XY size compensation"" settings that you can use to shrink/expand the part by b/2 to correct the fixed width error. Any residual fixed-width error that you cannot correct with slicer settings should be added as a tolerance in your part models. </li>
</ol>

<p>If you follow these steps, you should get +/-0.1mm or better dimensional precision on your prints.*</p>

"<p>I found a story about someone <a href=""http://www.fablabamersfoort.nl/en/node/534"">3D-printing equipment for their Lego minifig</a>, using an Ultimaker. (Article is in Dutch, but accompanied by photographs).</p>

<p>I noticed that what they made weren't the actual connecting bricks, but the tools used by the minifig. And that even so, some filing and a dremel were needed afterwards to make them fit properly.</p>

<p>I'm told that to make something connect properly with real Lego, the machine needs to be tuned very precisely.  </p>

<p>So, what resolution is needed to print bricks that will connect with normal Lego bricks?</p>
"
"<p>It's really more about calibration than resolution -- a poorly calibrated printer will have dimension errors that prevent mating with true LEGO bricks or other printed bricks. </p>

<p>Also, ""resolution"" is an incredibly loaded term for 3d printers, because it can mean a lot of different things. But we don't need to get into that right now. There are really two big things to worry about: layer height and extrusion width.</p>

<p>Layer heights of 0.1mm or 0.2mm should be fine. Coarser layers may run into surface finish issues that make the bricks difficult to put together or take apart. There probably isn't much reason to go finer than 0.1mm for this application. Almost all FFF printers can do 0.1mm layer heights as long as it is reasonably well-tuned.</p>

<p><strong>Any typical household FFF printer with a ""normal"" nozzle size can print fine enough for the bricks to work. It just needs to be tuned well.</strong> The smallest ""must have"" feature in a standard lego brick is the 1.6mm thick wall around the sides. The typical minimum printable feature size for an FFF printer is 2x the extrusion width, because the slicer will place a path on the inside edge of the shape and the outside edge of the shape. (Some slicers will allow single-extrusion features, but this is not generally recommended because it makes weak parts.) </p>

<p>So, how wide is the extrusion width? It's adjustable, and different slicers auto-recommend different values, but as a safe rule of thumb it needs to be between 1x and 2x your nozzle size. There are some volume calculation quirks in different slicers that may encourage larger or smaller sizes, so sometimes people recommend [extrusion width = nozzle size + layer height] particularly with Slic3r. This is very system-specific. </p>

<p>Assuming you have the most common stock nozzle with a 0.4mm orifice, and also set the extrusion width to 0.4mm, the slicer should put four strands in the walls of the LEGO brick. That's good. </p>

<p>Where it gets tricky is if you have an extrusion width that does not evenly divide into 1.6mm. Say you are printing with an extrusion width of 0.6mm. There is enough room in the wall of the part to place two full 0.6mm perimeter strands... but then a gap 0.4mm wide will be left in the center. You can't put another 0.6mm strand into that 0.4mm gap. Different slicers handle this different ways. Some will leave an empty space between the walls, and you get a very weak print. Some will mash an excessive amount of plastic into the gap, causing poor print quality as excess material builds up more and more on each layer. Some will push a smaller-than-commanded strand to try to properly fill the volume. </p>

<p>So, the general advice with small features is to make sure your extrusion width goes into the part's minimum thickness a reasonable number of times.</p>

<ul>
<li>[Feature size / extrusion width &lt; 2] is BAD  </li>
<li>[Feature size / extrusion width = 2] is GOOD </li>
<li>[2 &lt; Feature size / extrusion width &lt; 3] is BAD </li>
<li>[Feature size / extrusion width > 3] is GOOD</li>
</ul>

<p>Although these will vary somewhat by slicer -- older slicers like Skeinforge tend to have more issues with this than newer slicers. What you should do in practice is check your slicer's print previewer to see whether it is leaving a gap between the strands. Then adjust extrusion width and perimeter/shell count to try to get an intelligent output. There's some trial and error involved.</p>

"<p>The first big space-specific issue is actually air quality. You can't just open a window to air out the molten-ABS smell from the ISS! </p>

<p>FFF printers put out fumes and nanoparticles. In a space station, the same air gets recycled over and over, and the air purification systems have a specific set of contaminants that they are optimized for, as well as a design capacity for air turnover and chemical removal rates that won't be adjusted just because somebody's printing a space-ratchet today. Protecting cabin air quality is a huge design factor for any experiment that goes into space.</p>

<p>The Made in Space printing experiments on the ISS to date were performed in one of the vacuum experiment chambers, so any unfiltered fumes (or fire flare-ups) could be vented directly to space if required. In the long run, this isn't going to work -- other experiments may need the vacuum chamber, or ""production"" printers may be too large to fit. So the printer needs to have its own internal air purification system. </p>

<p>Another MAJOR design constraint is launch survival. Rocket payloads must be designed for extreme g-forces without 1) damage, or 2) significant internal shifting of mass which would affect the payload center of gravity.</p>

<p>Total payload weight is also quite important here: lifting mass to low Earth orbit is EXPENSIVE. </p>

<p>Surprisingly, the microgravity environment itself isn't that big of a deal. Molten plastic is highly viscous and pretty much stays where you put it long enough to solidify, as long as it's sticking to something. But two impacts do come to mind. </p>

<ul>
<li>First, an unsecured filament spool will try to unwind itself. Gravity won't provide the contact friction we usually rely on to keep spools from bird's-nesting. (Think about it: a tightly-wound spool is literally a giant coil-spring.) </li>
<li>Second, heat flows are different in microgravity -- you can't rely on passive convection to cool the print or the motors. Accommodations must be made for sufficient forced airflow and heat-sinking on anything that requires cooling. And that includes the enclosure itself, since, as mentioned above, the print chamber must be sealed up tight for air quality control. </li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, reliability is critical. Amazon doesn't deliver to the ISS (yet). Even a single stripped screw may take the printer out of commission for months until a replacement part can be fit into an upcoming supply launch. Having the printer catch on fire because something shorted would be catastrophic.</p>

<p>So, really, it's all about making a printer robust enough to make it up there, operate safely, and never break. Printing upside-down is trivial in comparison. </p>
"
"<p>I was just shopping for filament, and saw some glowing claims about PETG being as easy to work with as PLA, but as strong as ABS, and less brittle. Anyone know if that's actually true, or what the tradeoffs are?</p>
"
"<p>PETG is great stuff to work with. It is stronger than ABS also. It prints slower than ABS and PLA. The formulas vary quite a bit from vendor to vendor. I have used 3 brands, and each of their properties vary. </p>

<p>From my experience you do have to be careful with moisture. You'll be able to tell you have moisture in your filament if you start hearing a slight hissing and popping and an increased number of structural zits on the object. Moisture will also increase the problem listed in Mark's post below regarding the accumulation of filament on the nozzle.</p>

"<p><strong>No, do not use this fuse.</strong> The current rating is too high to be reasonable for your printer. It will ""work"" in the sense that your printer will get power, but it won't provide anywhere near as much protection as a lower-rated fuse. </p>

<p>10A is a lot of current for mains voltage. Depending on what else you have plugged in, there is a fair chance your home's 15A breaker will trip before this fuse does, which kind of defeats the point of having it. </p>

<p>Even for ""fast"" fuses, it takes a significant amount of time for them to blow when conducting their rated current. The internal fusible link has to heat up and melt before the fuse stops conducting. The less the overload current exceeds the rating, the longer that takes. A 10A fuse conducting a 10.5A short might take 30 seconds to trip. In the meantime, your printer is melting. Lower-rated fuses will trip faster for the same short and thus provide better protection. </p>

<p><em>You need to size fuses as small as possible for the required current draw if you want to have any hope of rapidly cutting off an excessive-current event.</em></p>

<p>I would recommend a 4A fuse in the USA for this 350w power supply. (Note: the listing title says 360 but the photos show 350.) I use 4A fuses in several printers with 120v / 350w PSUs and they do not trip. But you can do the math for yourself:</p>

<p>350 watts / 120 volts / 80% efficiency = 3.64A</p>

<p>The smallest fuse you can find that is larger than this value is what you should use. </p>

<p>Now, we can argue over whether 80% is the right efficiency value... it could be lower. The PSU label says 6.5A input is required, but that amount of current draw implies either a &lt;50% efficiency (which is quite poor for this kind of PSU) or would only occur for abuse/surge scenarios like starting very large motors. Such short-lived inrush events generally won't trip a fuse unless you do something dumb like lock the rotor. And none of that applies to the small microstepping-driver stepper motor systems we're working with here. This PSU should not draw more than 4A in normal 3D printer use.</p>

<p>Looking at this on the other end -- how much damage will 10A do versus 4A? Lots. If the short is in the 12v system, and the PSU's short protection doesn't trip in (because it's a cheap knock-off) you would roughly multiply the AC fuse current times 10 to get the DC current. And 40A is a downright scary amount of current! Depending on wire gauge, putting 40A through heatbed wiring may make it smell and smoke. Whereas putting 100A through heatbed wiring will almost certainly start a fire. </p>

<p>You're much safer with a 4A or even 6A fuse for this PSU than a 10A fuse. </p>
"
"<p>In addition to what @AsaDeDeBuck said, PETG is also more flexible than PLA, and less stinky than ABS. Furthermore, some PETG variants like to accumulate on the nozzle (particulate build up) and then char a bit before being deposited at some random spot on the object.</p>

"<p>The Monoprice Architect is is a bare-bones FlashForge Creator that has been re-badged for Monoprice. The Creator line is a very popular set of printers, so there is lots of good advice out there. The FlashForge Google Group is a good community to join: <a href=""https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/flashforge"" rel=""nofollow"">https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/flashforge</a></p>

<p>The entire FF Creator line, in turn, is cloned from the original Makerbot Replicator 1. So you can use Makerbot slicing profiles for the Replicator 1. Just keep in mind that Makerbot does not generally test new software revs with their older printers, and DEFINITELY does not test new software revs with competitor knock-offs. Sometimes they appear to break functionality for non-Makerbot machines on purpose. So recent versions of Makerbot Desktop may not ""play nice"" with your FlashForge. <strong>The most recent ""known good"" free slicer you should use with this printer is Makerware 2.4.x. You can find links by searching the FF Google Group.</strong></p>

<p>On that note, you may have received instructions to use ReplicatorG with your printer. But RepG is abandonware: development stopped years ago. It should only be used for firmware updates, not as a slicer. You should also only use the most recent version posted on the Sailfish page on Thingiverse: </p>

<p><a href=""http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:32084"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:32084</a></p>

<p>Using older versions of RepG with newer firmware revs will corrupt your EEPROM! Only use the version downloaded from the link above. </p>

<p>The firmware that comes with the printer is FlashForge's slightly-customized build of either Sailfish or Makerbot's Replicator 1/2/2x firmware. But here's the trick: Makerbot's Rep1/2/2x firmware is just an old, out-of-date, slightly customized version of Sailfish. Makerbot stopped keeping up with bug-fixes and feature additions a long time ago. <strong>Everything is Sailfish:</strong> just different versions. You should use the most recent official release version listed at:</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.sailfishfirmware.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sailfishfirmware.com/</a></p>

<p>Follow the instructions in the Sailfish manual from the link above, and RepG will automatically pull the right builds from the official mirror and populate a list of printer options to choose. The trick here is which build to download. As of 1-21-16, there is not an official Monoprice Architect build yet. Which would mean editing a machine xml profile to avoid the firmware throwing warnings. I STRONGLY recommend getting used to the printer using factory firmware before trying to fight with custom machine profiles... But here is the basic process to pick a Sailfish firmware build when you're ready:</p>

<p>First: which Atmega processor version do you have? The large chip in the middle of the control board will either say 1280 or 2560. You need to know which version you have. Bad things happen if you load the wrong version.</p>

<p>Second: What is the tooth count on the X and Y drivetrain pulleys? To my knowledge, FF always uses 17-tooth pulleys, which matches the Replicator 1 and FF Creator profiles. The Rep2 and 2x use 18t pulleys, so only use those builds if you have those pulleys. People often mess this up and their prints end up with dimensions ~5% off in X and Y. </p>

<p>Third: The Architect has one extruder and no heatbed, so firmware builds that expect those to be connected (Rep 1 Dual, Creator, etc) will throw errors if loaded. You can fix this from the LCD screen or RepG, but that's a whole separate question. Do some printing and learn about the printer before attempting any firmware update so you'll know what to do if you pick a build with the wrong parts. </p>

<p>Fourth: This one is just for the sake of completeness. Some FF models were shipped with off-spec heatbeds that require special firmware builds to prevent drawing too much current and overheating / overloading the power supply. The Architect doesn't have that, but firmware builds for those printer models (eg I believe the FF Creator 2560) will under-power regular heatbeds. This is just something you need to know with the Architect if you decide to install a heatbed later. But it's a really critical safety warning for people with those off-spec heatbeds. </p>

<p>If this all seems complicated, that's because FlashForge (and in turn Monoprice) relies heavily on the open source Sailfish project to maintain the software ecosystem behind this line of printers. FlashForge has some internal builds that they use for flashing new bots, but these are not kept particularly up-to-date. Nor does FlashForge release the source files, so it's quite opaque where exactly the stock firmware differs from mainstream Sailfish. In the long run, you should install mainline Sailfish. But it's ok to stick with the factory firmware until you get used to the printer. </p>

<p>To summarize: Because there is not an existing Sailfish build, you're going to need to do some investigating and some experimenting to figure out which build will work. Don't try that until you're familiar with the printer. Post on the FlashForge Google Group when you're ready for help.</p>

"<p>It's important to understand what specifically is being compared. <strong>CLIP is much faster than bottom-up technologies that require a peel step between every layer.</strong> For example, the Form1 galvo SLA printer tilts the resin vat to separate the transparent bottom from the print. That is, by far, the slowest part of SLA/DLP printing with most modern light sources. Where the speed comes in is that without a peel, a continuous ""movie"" can be used to cure the resin rather than a series of alternating images and peels. </p>

<p>Top-down printers can print dramatically faster than bottom-up-and-peel printers. CLIP is not necessarily faster than top-down. For example, the Gizmo 3D line of top-down printers are very similar in print speed to CLIP. (<a href=""http://www.gizmo3dprinters.com.au/"">http://www.gizmo3dprinters.com.au/</a>)</p>

<p>Most ""consumer"" SLA printers these days use bottom-up-and-peel techniques, because this has some practical advantages over top-down printers:</p>

<ul>
<li>Way less resin is required to fill the printer when the part is pulled out as it builds rather than being lowered into the tank (along with the Z stage) as it builds. Resin is expensive. This also means bottom up printers can be smaller and have fewer mechanical parts such as leveling devices submerged in resin. </li>
<li>Standard resins contain an inhibitor chemical that prevents polymerization in the presence of oxygen, which causes the surface layer exposed to air (and low-level stray light) to not cure. So top-down printers must shoot light through a non-curing layer before reaching curable resin. This makes the tuning more sensitive and can somewhat reduce detail compared to a bottom-up printer curing right on the window.</li>
<li>Replacement vats or windows for bottom-up printers may be seen by manufacturers as a profit-generating consumable, since they have to be replaced somewhat frequently.</li>
<li>Top-down printers have to worry somewhat more about resin flow rates as the part is lowered. Air bubbles may be pulled into the resin or the fresh resin layer above the part may vary significantly in thickness if the part is submerged too fast for the resin viscosity. (Admittedly, bottom-up printers will experience excessive suction forces and potentially break off bits of the print at high peel speeds.)</li>
</ul>

<p>CLIP is a bottom-up technique that doesn't require a peel step, because the vat creates an oxygen layer over the window that keeps the resin from curing directly on the surface and sticking. In that way, it arguably performs more like a top-down printer than a bottom-up printer. </p>

<p>Top-down printers that are designed to overcome the above issues and use high-intensity light sources can achieve exceptionally high print speeds. This includes similar ""continuous"" build techniques used as in CLIP.</p>

"<p>In Cura, I can edit my .ini profile settings as needed, for example, when I change filament or models.

"<p>Since the printer has no heater, I'd advise some sleuthing</p>

<ol>
<li>Look at the motherboard.  Find the big black square chip and see if it is a ATmega 1280 or 2560.  Likely it's a 1280, but you never know.  This will impact which firmware build you use.</li>
<li>If you will eventually add a heater PCB, then figure out the size (wattage) of the power supply.  It may be big enough now for a heated platform, or maybe not.  I guess you can cross that bridge if/when you add a HBP (heated build platform).  However, it can make a difference as to which firmware build you load as some builds of Sailfish will intentionally serialize heating so as to not put too high of a load on the power supply (PSU).</li>
</ol>

<p>Armed with the above info, you can then decide if you want a 1280 or 2560 build of Sailfish.  And if you want a build which will serialize eventual use of an HBP or not.</p>

<p>Serialized: MakerBot Replicator 1 Single &amp; Dual (implied ATmega 1280), MakerBot Replicator 1 with ATmega 2560</p>

<p>Non-serialized: FlashForge Creator I, II &amp; X (implied ATmega 1280)</p>

<p>For a non-serialized, 2560 build know that the FlashForge one is for a poorly behaved heater PCB and you likely won't want it.  That sort of leaves you without a good, non-serialized choice.  In a pinch you can use the ZYYX 3D build for a 2560.  Or you can contact the Sailfish team directly: speaking with very certain knowledge, I can assure you that they'd be happy to do a targetted build for your machine.  However, at present they lack info to do so (e.g., build volume, distances from endstops to center of build platform, etc.).</p>

<p>In what ways is drilling a hole in a model made from that material like or unlike drilling wood? Is it worth getting special ""plastic drilling bits"" that cost tons of money or can I use regular high speed drill bits? Do these plastics have grain that they will split on when drilled into, and if so, what are ways to avoid such splitting? Are higher speeds better, or lower speeds, or should I only use a finger-twirled bit holder?</p>

<p>Are some 3D-printing materials easier to drill than others?</p>

<p>What other methods also work for creating a hole in the different types of plastics?</p>
"
"<p>I wouldn't recommend drilling a hole in a 3D printed part in a traditional sense like with wood. Instead, I would merely ream a 3D printed part.</p>

<p>I've done this quite a bit where I'll print my holes at a slightly smaller than nominal size and use a standard carbide drill to ream the hole.</p>

<p>Things to consider:</p>

<ul>
<li>Printing the holes smaller than nominal will ensure your hole is not printed larger than nominal</li>
<li>Printing with a higher shell will ensure you can remove the material without exposing the infill</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that drilling directly into (or thru) an infill area of the part could lead to cracking of the part later, depending on the hole's functionality. In general, a printed hole (even if reamed) will be significantly stronger than one drilled through an infill area.</p>
"
"<p>Have to get this out of the way... Can you just print the hole into the part instead of drilling? That's usually best, when possible. </p>

<p>If you need to drill, you'll definitely want to print an undersized hole and then ream it out with the drill. This both provides alignment for the drill and adds extra plastic around the region you'll be weakening. If you don't know where the hole needs to go in advance, fill the model with a hex pattern of tiny holes in the general region of the future drilling. This is an easy way to strengthen the area with more plastic without making the entire part solid. (Using a slicer that allows localized print settings will also work.)</p>

<p>The hole should be aligned more or less vertical or ""across the grain"" (+/-45 degrees aligned with the Z axis) to ensure there are nice, strong hoops of plastic around the hole to keep it from splitting. Drilling into a printed part (particularly PLA) from the side / parallel to the XY plane is highly likely to split it. It may even be ok at first but crack later under load or due to creep. </p>

<p>Regular wood drill bits work ok, but you need to go slow and take nibbles, leaving the plastic time to cool so it doesn't melt and stick to the bit. (Coolant is an option.) Use a pilot hole, piloted bit, or step drill to remove less plastic per pass. A really sharp bit will perform dramatically better than a dull bit. </p>

<p>Put something hard and drillable like wood behind the plastic part to help avoid breakage and bit-jamming when you break through the opposite side. </p>

<li>The device does something. By doing something it draws <strong>current</strong>. Most devices also draw some current when not doing anything.</li>
<li>How much power your device draws is the product of these two values:<code>voltage x current = power</code> </li>
</ol>

<p>So far, so good. In your case:</p>

<ol>
<li><blockquote>
  <p>US AC outlet.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>the <strong>voltage is 120V</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>On <a href=""http://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/q/352/10"">this other question of yours</a> you linked to <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B007KG0ZYI"" rel=""nofollow"">this power
supply on amazon</a>. Besides being available gift-wrapped, it
states the following feature:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You can choose the input voltage (110V/240V) by switch.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>110V ≈ 120V, which means the <strong>device voltage matches your supply
voltage</strong>.</p></li>
<li>The supply can deliver 30A at 12V on the DC side which means 360W.
If it could transform the electricity ideally, without any
inefficiency, that would be <strong>3A</strong> at 120V on the AC side. But your
supply is unlikely ideal. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switched-mode_power_supply#SMPS_and_linear_power_supply_comparison"" rel=""nofollow"">Wikipedia suggests 60-95% efficiency</a>.
Let's be super pessimistic and assume 50%. That means half the power
that goes into the switch power supply is turned into heat. In order
to still get the 360W out, you have to insert 720W. That means
<strong>your device draws 6A</strong> on the AC side.</li>
</ol>

<p>What does this all mean for your wire?
What wire size do you need for this supply?</p>

<p>Coincidentally, the above link to the amazon website showing your power supply also suggests the following PC ATX power supplies to me:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B00SN6VN7W"" rel=""nofollow"">Sentey Power Supply 725 Watt</a></li>
<li><a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B00I3IXEBI"" rel=""nofollow"">Sentey Power Supply 1000 Watt</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Let's get this straight: You can buy a power supply for a PC and plug it into your outlet without even thinking about what a wire size is. You'd just plug and play. <strong>That PC power supply will potentially draw more current</strong> than <strong>the power supply of your 3D printer</strong>. A standard wire would be able to supply either one of the PC ATX power supplies linked above and would not have a problem delivering a lower current to the power supply of your 3D printer.</p>

<p>The switching supply doesn't have a plug like a PC ATX supply, but that on its own doesn't make it any less secure (if wired up properly). It's just less common for household appliances.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ultimately, I'd like to avoid a fire, or damage to the house wiring.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That's a good and valid concern. </p>

<p>PC Power supplies deliver 12V and supply more than enough current (like the examples above). They are probably in use in your house already and did neither set it on fire nor damage the house wiring.</p>

<p>A switching mode power supply is just as secure and if bought from a known brand unlikely to do you any harm either if used properly and within its specifications.</p>

<p><strong>Ultimately</strong>, this is not a question of secure electricity but a trade-off between secure electricity and the price to pay for it. The standard wire and it's specifications have little to do with this.</p>

<hr>

<p>Personally, I also use a cheap switching power supply made in china for my printer. It's very noisy and I pull the plug when I leave it unattended.</p>

"<p>It's somewhat unclear what you mean by ""standard PC cable"", but virtually all desktop computers use <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEC_60320#C13.2FC14_coupler"" rel=""nofollow"">IEC C14 sockets/IEC C13 plugs</a>. Such connectors/sockets are rated for 10A 250V and thus you can safely assume that the cord itself will also be able to handle this voltage and current. 10A is what is specified by the IEC, certain North American standards agencies rate C13 cords for up to 15A.</p>

<p>The IEC standard also specifies that the conductors inside of a C13 lead have a cross sectional area of at least 0.75mm^2 and at least 1mm^2 if the cord is longer than 2m.</p>

"<p>If I need to test out some of the components of a RAMPS 1.4 based 3D Printer, can I only plug some of them into the board (not all of them) and test them out?</p>

<p>I'd like to test out the NEMA 17 motors without testing the heated bed or extruder.  Is this safe and why?</p>
"
"<p>Yes, you can. By leaving components unplugged you would simply have some pins powered that are not in use. But even with all your components plugged in, you would still have some unused, powered pins on your board, so I wouldn't think too hard about that. In some cases it might be needed to mount e.i. fans to cool your electronics while running, but for testing a few stepper motors, you will be just fine.</p>

<p>Exactly how you would address each individual motor depends on your setup, however. My best bet would be to simply rely on your ""default"" firmware (such as Marlin), and then run commands for testing through Pronterface/PrintRun or similar. </p>

<p>Alternatively, you could upload your own sketch/firmware to the Arduino, and manipulate each stepper driver individually. This is a somewhat more advanced option, though.</p>
"
"<p>If by components you mean motors, fans, or heated bed, then yes. This is even suggested in the <a href=""http://reprap.org/wiki/RAMPS_1.4#Final_Setup"" rel=""nofollow"">Final Setup</a> instructions on the RAMPS wiki.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you think you may have mistakes (in your setup) you can install only one stepper driver during initial testing and risk only one stepper driver.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are also printers using RAMPS with no heated bed and other machines that have no extruder at all. Furthermore, from an electronics perspective: if nothing is connected across a terminal no current will flow and therefore there is no damage that can be done. Obviously if you short out the unused connections there will be problems.</p>

"<p>I am working on a Python code (below) that accelerates a stepper motor until it reaches a specific amount of steps.</p>

    time.sleep(s_per_s)

<p>s_per_s = time in between each step</p>

<p>astart = starting speed in second/step (for example 0.5)</p>

<p>aend = speed at which the acceleration should stop (for example 0.05)</p>

<p>accelerationsteps = amount of steps over which the acceleration should happen</p>

<p>The problem is that the velocity increases in <strong>step per second per step</strong> instead of <strong>step per second per second</strong>, and is therefore increased exponentially instead of linear.

"<p>I have never used ABS, because I have a young child at home and no ventilation system (just to be safe). I have however used PETG, a crystal clear brand competitively priced on AMA-ssive online retailer, I loved it and will probably only buy it in the future.</p>

<p><strong>Advantages Noted:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>There is no odor I could detect</p></li>
<li><p>It is remarkably clear, like glass using a large nozzle (1.2) and layer diameter. </p></li>
<li>It flexes without breaking I'm guessing what seems like about 10-15% more than PLA. 
In other words if I print a large circular ring I can squeeze the ring about 10 to 15% farther without the ring cracking or breaking. </li>
<li>The material itself is more dense, identically printed items have more weight to them and feel sturdy.</li>
<li>It has a higher glass transition temperature</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Disadvantages  noted:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>It's a little more expensive, but not prohibitively so (like carbon fiber). </p></li>
<li><p>It requires a higher printing temperature, so uses more power.</p></li>
<li><p>I havent perfected my retraction settings, and I have read others having similar issues with excess stringing. IOW it oozes more than PLA. </p></li>
<li><p>Switching between this and PLA requires extra care and time to ensure the nozzle is clear. I guess that is the same with any other alternate material as well.</p></li>
</ul>
"
"<p>As others have also said, this is generally fine. The main things I'd avoid are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Don't plug or unplug ""heavy"" items (mainly motors and heaters) with power on; turn everything off first. This is especially true for motors, whose coils produce a hefty back-voltage when disconnected.</p></li>
<li><p>Be extra careful about stepper <em>drivers</em>. For example, some printers use 2 motors for Z, so if you test each axis against one driver, the current requirement may be quite different for each axis.</p></li>
<li><p>Plugging in a limit switch backwards on RAMPS is likely to short +5V straight to ground, which is worth avoiding.</p></li>
</ul>
"
"<p>I haven't done anything special to set up mine. But it's probably worth doing a general cleaning. I'd swab it off with alcohol, including running a q-tip or similar inside the fiber feed path. Then blow out the nozzle with compressed air to make sure it's clear.</p>

<p>You could measure the nozzle diameter by fitting fine drill bits in to see which is the largest one the passes through freely. Be sure to measure how much fiber your extruder <em>really</em> takes in when you ask it to extrude a certain length -- but that's about the extruder, not the hotend per se.</p>

<p>Finally, I'd check the insulation, if any. I got a couple hot ends that had big gaps in/around the insulation. I've found that ""high-temperature gasket maker"" is great for improving insulation (depends, of course, on the shape and design of the specific hot end.</p>

"<p>High Impact PolyStyrene (HIPS) is a frequently used filament in 3D printing.  It has been touted to have simular properties when printed to ABS and is especially useful for support structures (if the user has a multi-nozzle 3d Printer) as it is soluble in Limonene.</p>

<p>General Purpose PolyStyrene (GPPS) is frequently used in disposible cups, cutlery, etc.  I don't believe I have seen it as a 3D printing filament.

<p>Would filament produced from GPPS, be usable on most FFF 3D printers that are capable of using ABS, PLA, and HIPS? Are that any particular issues observed with such filaments that would not be observed with HIPS (besides the implied decrease in impact resistance)?</p>

"<p>There is a little circuit board, or breadboard or something <a href=""http://reprap.org/wiki/Prusa_i3_Rework_Electronics_and_wiring#Wiring"" rel=""nofollow"">in the diagram of the wiring for the i3</a>.</p>

<p>And it's mentioned that the z-axis motors need to be <a href=""http://reprap.org/wiki/Prusa_i3_Rework_Electronics_and_wiring#Motors_wiring"" rel=""nofollow"">wired in parallel</a>.  But beyond that they don't give you much detail about parts or how the wires go in.  Can someone provide me with some more detail on this?</p>
"
"<p>In the diagram, they do show the wires connecting together, which is right. You can accomplish that just about any way you like, so long as you pair up the wires correctly from one motor to the other.</p>

<p>I'm assuming both ""Z"" motors are the same type and have the same color-coding for their wires. If not, you'll need to figure out the correspondences first (you may want to post another question if you need a hand with that, since it's pretty specific and generally useful).</p>

<p>Many control boards have ""headers"" sticking up, with 4 bare pins for each motor. Connectors that plug right onto those are readily available, such as at <a href=""https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10364"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10364</a>.</p>

<p>Some ways you can wire the motors in parallel:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Some control boards, like my RAMPS 1.4, provide 2 sets of header pins next to the Z stepper driver board. In that case, just put a connector on each motor (if they're not there already), and plug them in next to each other.</p></li>
<li><p>If there's just one set of header pins (or one Z-motor socket of some other kind) on your controller, make a ""Y-cord"" by soldering the wires from one connector (that plugs to the controller) to <em>2</em> 4 pin connectors, one to mate with each motor.</p></li>
<li><p>Or you can skip the 2 extra connectors entirely, and just solder the motor wires to the wires from the connector: 2 reds to red, 2 blacks to black, or whatever.</p></li>
<li><p>If your controller just has empty holes, either solder in header pins and do as above (preferred, imho), or wire directly into the holes, splicing the 2 sets of motor wires if there's only one set of holes.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Motor and connector wires are wildly inconsistent, so make sure you get them sorted out right if they aren't already. The first thing is to check continuity: find 2 pairs of wires, which are the ends of two separate coils. If your motors have more than 4 wires it's trickier.</p>

<p>With RAMPS (see handy diagram at <a href=""http://makerdev.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/ramps_fanboard_annotations.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://makerdev.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/ramps_fanboard_annotations.jpg</a>), the 4 pins are commonly labelled (starting from the one nearest the power-supply end of the RAMPS board):</p>

<pre><code>2B 2A 1A 1B
</code></pre>

<p>It means coil 1 and coil 2, each of which has ends A and B. I find this unclear because it could just as well have been numbers for the coils, and letters for the ends (if you wire it that way it won't work). So be sure you have continuity (maybe 15 ohms or so) between the wires you connect to 2B and 2A, and between the wires you connect to 1A and 1B.</p>

<p>The <em>really good thing</em> about this pin order is that if a motor is running backwards all you have to do is power off and then turn the plug around. That's one reason I think it's important to keep connectors in there, rather than soldering directly.</p>
"
"<p>To measure amps (current), the meter has to be wired in series with the item to be measured (for this reason, ammeters are designed to have very low resistance). </p>

<p>This has the down-side that you have to disconnect the component to put the meter in line with it. That makes it hard to do the ""check a component at a time"" method you mentioned.</p>

<p>An ammeter measures <em>actual</em> current flow, so you really can't test a component for it in isolation. Components can have wildly different ""current draw"" depending on the situation. For example, motor current varies with torque and speed; current through a resistor varies with the voltage across it; and so on.</p>

<p>There are special ""clamp-on"" current meters that just clamp around a conductor and report the current by using induction. Very nice if you have one.</p>

<p>If you just want the total current the entire RAMPS board is pulling, put the ammeter between the power supply and the RAMPS power input connection(s). Be <em>very</em> sure not to have the meter set to read volts or ohms when you do this (it might or might not survive).</p>
"
"<p>The easiest method is to use a Clamp On amp meter on either the hot or neutral of your power supply.  </p>

<p>In most cases clamp on meters only work with AC xor DC power so you would only be able to get the reading on one side of the power supply.</p>

<p>Multiply this number by the voltage and you get the wattage.</p>
"
"<p>In principle, it should work fine as a filament, since it's used extensively in the plastic extrusion industry, but I don't think you'd get great material properties out of it. ABS and HIPS incorporate polybutadiene into a graft polymer structure for a very good reason: the butadiene sections in the long molecular chains kind of ""stick together"" as a distinct solid phase to produce what amounts to micro-bubbles of rubber inside a matrix of hard styrene or acrylonitrile-styrene plastic. This compound microstructure is what gives HIPS and ABS favorable impact toughness and some minor flexibility.</p>

<p>The flexibility is important -- the stiffer a filament is, the more it will tend to warp while printing. Based on chemistry alone, I would expect styrene to be somewhat more prone to warping than ABS. And it would certainly be more brittle. So there doesn't seem to be much reason to use it as filament.</p>

<p>Interesting sidenote: PLA/PHA has very favorable mechanical properties because the PHA forms a very similar flexible microstructure inside the hard PLA matrix. PLA/PHA is good stuff because it mimics ABS and HIPS!</p>

"<p>I'm thinking about buliding my own 3D printer from scratch. </p>

"
"<p>There are a big variety of them that can be found at the market. Some of them have similar characteristics, the other varies from each other.</p>

<p>What are props and cons of cheaper filament vs expensive filament?</p>

<p>How to choose which filament to use?</p>
"
"<p>From a general point of view, there are a few things to consider.</p>

<p><strong>If you buy a kit</strong>:</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<ul>
<li>You get some insurance that <em>you have all the parts that you need</em> to get a functional printer - all the electronics, structure, bolts, nuts, screws, washers, wires and so on.</li>
<li>Most likely, all the parts you get are made to <em>fit together</em>.</li>
<li>You will (usually) get a <em>manual</em>, often a community that can help you out, and sometimes even technical support.</li>
<li>Sometimes, it can be <em>cheaper</em> than buying each part separately (but it can also be more expensive)</li>
</ul>

<p>Cons:</p>

<ul>
<li>You have limited/no options to customize your printer to your own preferences without purchasing additional parts. </li>
<li>Some kits can be difficult to upgrade later or may be locked to some configuration or software.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>My opinion:</strong></p>

<p>The way I look at it, the better option for <em>you</em> depends on how you want to spend your time. That is:</p>

<ol>
<li>If you get a kit, you can spend more time building.</li>
<li>If you collect all the parts yourself, you will have to spend time planning, ordering parts (possibly multiple times) in addition to actually building the printer. A possible lack of manuals could also increase the building difficulty.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you don't already own a 3D printer, I would recommend getting a kit, simply because struggling with trivial things like parts not fitting together can take away the fun for many people.</p>
"
"<ol>
<li>Determine what properties you need the filament to have.</li>
</ol>

<p>There are a very wide variety of filaments because they all have somewhat different properties.  You need to determine what properties you need your final print to possess.  For instance, ABS can be smoothed used acetone and PLA is biodegradable. More exotic filaments could be conductive or be extremely flexible. Do not neglect to consider safety of the plastic in your application. A full list of properties is too broad for an appropriate answer from this site.</p>

<ol start=""2"">
<li>Determine what you printer is designed to handle.</li>
</ol>

<p>Most printers can handle PLA and ABS with little issue but higher temperatures are required to use some materials such as nylon and polycarbonate.  Determine beforehand what your printer is designed to handle.  This includes determining whether you have and appropriate heated bed or other accessories.</p>

<ol start=""3"">
<li>Determine what you can afford.</li>
</ol>

<p>Printing not only requires the cost of the weight of filament in the final print but all of the support structures and misprints you produce. Not only should you look for inexpensive filaments, but you should look for ones that are good enough quality you don't waste time and money fighting problems with the raw material.</p>

<p>All in all, this will vary case by case.  I would recommend that you start with PLA or ABS as they are common and relatively easy to work with but that you do your own research into what each individual filament type has to offer..  </p>

"<p>How do I smooth 3D printed objects? What is the best / common method to do this?</p>
"
"<p>Abrasive blasting is the only other method I can think of which you haven't said you don't want to try.</p>

<p>It is certainly the easiest method provided you have access to one. </p>

<p>Different forms of abrasive blasting include:</p>

<ul>
<li>shot blasting (metal shot) - I suspect it would be far to abrasive but I've never tried it.</li>
<li>sandblasting - you have to be careful but this is basically sandpaper attached to a wand. I've used it with great success.</li>
<li>bead blasting - using plastic beads. It might actually be the best option but I've never tried it.</li>
<li>media blasting - usually uses ground up shells. Might work but I've never tried it.</li>

"<p>I built my first printer from scratch, though it's fairly similar to an oversize MendelMax 2. It was a good learning experience, but very frustrating at times. Overall, I think I'm glad I did it that way, but a kit would have gotten me printing much faster and a bit cheaper.</p>

<p>Here are my main impressions from the experience...</p>

<ul>
<li><p>You should already be familiar with most of the basic skills involved: soldering, wood- and/or metal-working, electronics, etc. And don't forget software -- I wrote a lot of Arduino code for various things along the way.</p></li>
<li><p>You'll need to be diligent about searching for answers online, because there's no manual to go to. This group should make it a lot easier now than it was last year.</p></li>
<li><p>Some problems will have great answers online; some won't, or the answers will be hard to piece together. I found that stepper motors have a ""lore"" all their own, with several subtleties I didn't expect.</p></li>
<li><p>You'll have to decide <em>how</em> ""from scratch"" you want to go -- I bought completed Arduino Mega and RAMPs boards, but you could buy a kit or components for those instead, or even design your own electronics altogether.</p></li>
<li><p>You'll make mistakes and spend money to recover. For example, my Y-axis motor couldn't move the build platform nearly fast enough (too much inertia), so I had to re-work that axis entirely, using a much more expensive lead screw, plus bearings, blocks, couplers,....</p></li>
<li><p>If you think you might want to sell the printer later, I imagine it would be easier if it's a known design.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>That said, it's a blast except when you get stuck; and the satisfaction when your first successful print comes out is pretty great.</p>

<p>Oh, one other hint: especially for hardware, buy in bulk. You can probably get 100 of a certain bolt online for the price of 10 at your local hardware store. Give or sell the leftovers to help others get started.</p>

"<p>Get a rock/jewelry tumbler and some tumbling media such as stainless steel shot, and try tumbling your print.</p>

<p>For 3D printed plastic, your print will (a) need to be sturdy, and (b) not have any fine details or small parts that you don't want to be worn away. With metal you will tumble it for hours in order to smooth and semi-polish the surface. With plastic, I would recommend a much shorter time period.</p>

<p>One person tried this using screws as his tumbling media, and has some interesting results to show for it. <a href=""http://thrinter.com/tumble-coating-3d-prints-part-1/"" rel=""nofollow"">Part 1</a>, <a href=""http://thrinter.com/tumble-coating-3d-prints-part-2/"" rel=""nofollow"">Part 2</a>, <a href=""http://thrinter.com/tumble-coating-3d-prints-part-3/"" rel=""nofollow"">Part 3</a>, <a href=""http://thrinter.com/tumble-coating-3d-prints-part-4/"" rel=""nofollow"">Part 4</a>. Basically, you can get a metallic coating on your plastic print that is made up of tiny bits of the tumbling medium. You'll need to add a protective coating to keep it from rubbing off, but it's cheaper than buying metallic filament.</p>

"<p>If you haven't been to their site before, you should check out the forums on 3DHubs. There's a lot of how-to's. A quick Google search yields <a href=""https://www.3dhubs.com/talk/thread/accelerated-nozzle-wear"" rel=""nofollow"">this</a> link to a similar question.</p>

<p>The key thing to note is that in all technicalities, any material you run through the nozzle is going to cause <em>some</em> sort of wear on your nozzle. <strong>How quickly</strong> depends on the material or composition.</p>

<p>The answer to the question linked above relates it spot on to sandpaper. If you have sandpaper made out of metal (ie stainless pla), it will scratch your skin fairly easily. If you have sandpaper made out of tree bark (ie laywood pla), it probably won't scratch your skin as bad, but it'll still scratch. And just for poops and giggles, lets say you have sandpaper made out of pla; it'll take a while, but you could eventually make your skin raw if you rub the plastic against your arm long enough.</p>

<p>It is typically recommended to use one nozzle for each material type as to avoid cross-contamination of materials in your printing. With this idea in mind, if you are using many types of materials, you can also minimize failed prints due to clogging and other ""damaged nozzle"" type troubles.</p>

"<p>I haven't used such fiber myself (yet), so this is an educated guess rather than experience. Assuming you mean the kind that has real tiny wood bits embedded, it <em>shouldn't</em> wear a brass nozzle badly, because the nozzle is considerably harder than the wood. Carbon fiber or steel embedded in filament are much harder, so would be expected to wear the nozzle much more.</p>

<p>That said, wood-based filament will still wear the nozzle slowly -- even a hardened steel drill bit gets dull with use, even if you only cut wood with it.</p>

"<p>You can basically use any machine that pulverizes your pellets into small pieces.</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.3dhubs.com/talk/thread/how-make-your-own-filament-recycling-old-3d-prints-part-1"" rel=""nofollow""><strong>One guy on 3dhubs, explained it in details.</strong></a></p>

<p>My conclusion is that you can recycle everything using this data gathered from research up in link there. </p>

<p>Also, you can use any plastic material and pulverize it into pellets (even from the bottles) and you can try to do this process. Only thing that matters is quality of product.</p>

<p>I was thinking about pellets from vinyl records. I bought one big collection before one year, and there was around 500-600 records that are completley useless. So, you can pulverize them and repeat the process, because process of making vinyl records and process of making bottles is completley different, and uses different kind of plastics. </p>

<p>So to draw a conslusion: everything depends on quality of pellets.</p>

<p>And to answer on your three questions:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is the quality comparable to typical off-the-shelf filaments? Put<br>
  another way, with reasonable tuning can one produce filament that's<br>
  good enough to use without a lot of frustration?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, it isn't Your filament would be lower quality if you don't get a great pellets.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Does it require a lot of attention to tuning, monitoring, or other
  details (which make it less worthwhile / more time-consuming)? Warning
  of pitfalls to avoid is also welcome.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes it does. Check the link up there.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Are there useful things one can do this way, that are hard to achieve
  with off-the-shelf filaments? For example, unusual materials; better
  control of diameter, density, etc; or mixing one's own colors?</p>

"<p>All rapid prototyping means is automatically producing a physical part from a cad model. 3D printing is a way to achieve rapid prototyping. There are 2 main methods of rapid prototyping: additive, and subtractive.</p>

<p>Usually, when people talk about a subtractive machine, they are talking about a CNC mill (or lathe), which tend to be extremely large (most are over one ton). You start with all the material there, and you subtract the material that you don't want. This might be what you are thinking of.</p>

"<p>1) Quality depends on 3 things:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>quality of pellets</p></li>
<li><p>where/how they are stored before and during the extrusion (humidity)</p></li>
<li><p>have a filter in your extruder to get rid of random junk and air bubbles ending up in your filament (250 micron wire mesh filter)</p></li>
</ol>

<p>There's no secret formula the filament producing companies have, they just have very efficient and very fast filament producing machines (of course very expensive, too). But when it comes to vanilla ABS or PLA, it's almost the same content.</p>

<p>2) Personal experience: no. If you get the same pellets, store it in the same place and run your extruder in the same place, it should behave the same.</p>

<p>3) I don't think there is some filament mixture you won't be able to find anywhere, but you might be able to make it yourself cheaper. Example: mixing strontium aluminate powder for glow in the dark filament (come in many colors, not just green).</p>

<p>I'd recommend this design: <a href=""http://www.instructables.com/id/Build-your-own-3d-printing-filament-factory-Filame/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.instructables.com/id/Build-your-own-3d-printing-filament-factory-Filame/</a>
It produces filament pretty fast (one full 1kg spoon in 3-4 hours). Just make sure you have enough experience to not electrocute yourself while assembling this as the heaters use mains power.
I personally think the commercial ""hobby"" extruders are not worth the money. I also own the Filastruder and it's just no different and slower than the above, unless you care about a pretty plywood case for your extruder I see no advantage and since it uses off-the-shelf parts itself why bother buying a kit like that than sourcing the parts yourself?</p>

"<p>To add to the above answer, a very simple way to say it is that FMD 3d printer is a rapid prototyping machine which has a component called an extruder which pulls and melts plastic which the machine then lays down.</p>
"
"<p>That's the temperature problem that you've encountered.</p>

<p>The temperature of bed and hotend is reported every few seconds. Per default, first that sets is the bed temperature, then you need to wait for the bed to reach it, then warm up the hotend, and then start printing.</p>
"
"<p>This is probably a result of bad quality filament. If you haven't changed much in your setups, haven't changed slicers, but may have changed spools, then this might be the result. I would try using another spool and perhaps switch suppliers. I know it's expensive and there seems to be a stigma around it, but MakerBot Industries provides quality PLA (some ABS also).</p>

<p>Other than that, you've done some of what I would suggest in this case which are the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Speeds</li>
<li>Layer height</li>
</ul>

<p>My only other suggestions would be:</p>

<ul>
<li>Check how level your build plate is</li>
<li>Check material requirements. ie ABS is ideal between 230-240C according to MSDS with about 110C build plate temp, PLA between 210-230C. Sometimes too hot of a hotend can result in overextrusion or ooze.</li>
<li>If the cylinder is smaller, try changing your slicing settings to have a time minimum for each layer. In my experience, a material like ABS will begin to flare out with variations in the print environment. When the material flares out, as the nozzle comes across the area again, the flared areas will be pushed aside. If you adjust your slicing settings to about 15 seconds (<a href=""http://www.abcgroup3.com/toolbox/mold_cooling_calc.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">refer to this calculator</a>), then the material will have time to cool slightly from its plastic state. You can cheat this slightly by adding another object somewhere further on the plate with the same height, since the time it takes to rapid to the area and print the layer might be enough time for cooling.</li>
</ul>

"<p>You very likely have partial clog in your hotend (the side which is clogged is the angle the extruding filament bends to) or have some plastic somehow stuck on the nozzle surface which the extruding plastic almost sticks to, like two droplets of water merging into one.</p>

<p>If its the latter, clean the hotend. It's easier to remove the plastic on it while its hot and soft, but don't burn yourself.</p>

<p>If it's a clog, that's more complicated.
First, you can make sure if it is indeed a clog or not by extruding into the air and measuring the wire with a caliper.
If it's thinner than it should be and your slicer settings are fine, then its a clog.</p>

<p>Ways to get rid of clog:</p>

<p>1) Replace the nozzle with a new one.</p>

<p>2) Break the clog with a sharp wire.</p>

<p>3) Take the hotend off and clean the nozzle with acetone (""acetone bath"").</p>

<p>4) Blow torch on a removed nozzle. Dangerous thing to do for some but it works. If you're not confident or experienced to do this and the previous two solutions don't help, then go with option 1.</p>

"<p>I just added a fan to my printer because very small layers seem to come out very badly. For example, the 5mm PLA cube that's the top level of the test shape shown below. Watching closely, I can see that the newly-extruded fiber is pushing the previous layer(s?) around pretty freely. And when the object is finished, the little top cube is bulging, rounded, and still soft to the touch. </p>

<p>The 2nd-to-top level of the object is also quite small and quick, but often comes out nicely (if anything, it was better before I added the fan).</p>

"<h2>Layer Times</h2>

<p>See my answer to <a href=""http://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/516/what-parameters-affect-cylinder-regularity"">this question</a> and pay particular attention to my suggestion about a minimum layer print time. I'm not sure if all slicing engines provide this option, but I know MakerWare/MakerBot Desktop and (possibly) Slic3r allow this setting.</p>

<p>Basically, when you're extruding smaller features like this, the previous layer(s) are still very hot and possibly very pliable. So, as your nozzle moves around above the previous layer, the nozzle may (and probably will) push some of this molten plastic around. Chances are you can see it to a certain degree while it's printing. You can definitely see this in a most drastic state if you print a tall and small diameter cylinder. You'll notice that the part will become almost exponentially unstable the higher it goes.</p>

<p>By increasing the time your printer takes to print a single layer, you are allowing the previous layer(s) to cool closer to the ambient temperature of the build space, and hopefully not as molten.</p>

<p>Please refer to <a href=""http://www.abcgroup3.com/toolbox/mold_cooling_calc.htm"">this calculator</a> or a similar one for material cooling times. For a standard shell setting of about 2-3 (0.4mm nozzle) will yield about 130sec to cool down to room temperature. I would recommend (for ABS/PLA at least) about a 15second minimum for each layer, possibly longer depending on the size and spread out of the features.</p>

<p>Also note that this can be cheated by simply printing multiple items in the same build plate with the same heights (ie. multiples of the same part). Naturally, it will take longer for the machine to print the rest of the parts and therefore allow each layer to cool slightly before being printed over.</p>

<h2>Active Cooling</h2>

<p>Again, some slicing engines have an Active Cooling setting. I don't personally have this option setup on my machine, but I believe it regulates the flow of air directed at your nozzle (usually by use of a mounted fan). This can help cool the layers a bit faster. With ABS, this might result in some pretty bad warping mid-print.</p>

<h2>Feedrates</h2>

<p>Try bringing down your feedrates to provide the printed portions of the current layer more time to cool if the above options aren't available. Note that you might also bring down your hotend temp to shorten the time it takes to cool the plastic.</p>

<h2>All else fails</h2>

<p>My only other suggestion is stated above, try printing duplicates on the same plate. My diagnosis is that the previous layers aren't cooling down enough before the next layer begins.</p>

"<p>It depends on how often you use your printer, meaning how many particles does your printer emit for time-unit. If you print nonstop with 5 printers then it's different situation opposite to one print per week.</p>

"<p>Generally, AVR is in fact less powerful than many ARM cores used today. Most printers with AVRs don't have floating-point coprocessors, although a lot of the step and movement control can be done in integer-only math (except for G2/G3). Marlin can interrupt for step handling <a href=""http://softsolder.com/2013/06/04/marlin-firmware-stepper-interrupt-timing/"">up to 10000 times per second</a> on AVR, translating to 40000 steps per second. This isn't particularly useful without mechanical components that can move at those speeds and still print meaningful results (or are far more precise and have a far higher step-count-per-mm at a similar speed).</p>

<p>Graphic display isn't a particularly taxing thing to do at <em>low</em> speeds--high speeds or weird interfaces might require a bit more power or a dedicated interrupt.</p>

<p>The times when ARM might be important are for more math-heavy and especially floating-point-heavy setups such as delta, where every move requires many floating-point and trig operations, and navigation in menus on a 16MHz AVR (atmega2560) <a href=""http://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/242/marlin-menu-navigation-slow-while-printing#comment294_242"">is described as</a> ""painfully slow"", but Marlin does succeed in printing meaningful results on delta-style printers.</p>

<p>Clearly, an ARM core that is either faster at performing soft floating-point, or supports hardfloat (hardware that does floating point operations very efficiently) will see a benefit for such processes.</p>
"
"<p>Generally, microcontrollers such as the AVR are single core / single threaded - so while working in a while loop to run the motor controller, you might be lacking resources to do anything else, like navigate a menu efficiently.</p>

<p>Many ARM processors now a days are multi core / multi threaded, meaning that you can have one thread working your print, while another is free for whatever else the user may want to do.</p>

<p>i.e. Any AVR processor running a local webserver to allow remote access to the printer would be painfully basic, where ARM would generally allow for much more flexibility.</p>

<p>Typically an FDM printer, such as a MakerBot Replicator, can yield undesirable results depending on how small you need the objects and how close each object is to another (ie bearings to the housing/each other). If you have a dual-extruding FDM printer, you could utilize a second support structure material. For example, you could print the bearings/housing in PLA and print the raft/supports using water soluble PVA. This provides a solid structure while printing without worry of having excess material in the housing (defeating the purpose of a bearing).</p>

<p>On the other hand, using the powder printer is most likely your best solution for creating the bearings (and less frustrating). Naturally, you will not need to worry about support structures as there is support inherently created as the powder is lain out for each layer. You just need to be sure that the tolerance of your model adhere to the capabilities of this machine and its post-processing.</p>

<p>Regardless of which technology you use, be sure that your design incorporates a means of allowing support material to be taken out after the print is complete.</p>

"<p>I believe you might be having an issue with insufficient cooling. Remember the suggestion to have wait times per layer to let the previous layer cool? Well, I think with your setup and print not only do individual layers overheat, but individual parts of each layer. You either need to try more direct or dual fan cooling or maybe use a nozzle with thinner outer diameter which will have less surface to heat the layed down plastic surrounding it.</p>

"<p>3D printer controllers have to do a lot of stuff very, very fast. Performing kinematics and dynamics calculations while sending many thousands of precisely-synchronized step pulses per second is <em>really, really hard</em>. The 8bit AVR line of microcontrollers used in older 3D printer controllers is basically a late-1990s era Mr Coffee processor. They are completely, utterly maxed out on processor time just executing basic printing functions in simple (eg Cartesian) printers, and adding additional calculation load will bog them down and cause slowdowns, stuttering, pausing, and so on. </p>

<p>""But my 8bit printer works fine,"" you say. No, it doesn't. Your print performance is limited by it, whether you realize it or not. Slicers now automatically hide a lot of the firmware's performance shortcomings from you. For example, the standard practice of greatly slowing down print speeds on perimeters is largely a result of 8bit processors having inadequate resources for two things:</p>

<ol>
<li>Performing centripetal acceleration calculations for curves
across multiple gcode segments </li>
<li>Keeping up with gcode transmission/processing and motion planning for gcode with lots of very small segments, such as in organic models or smooth arcs</li>
</ol>

<p>When presented with a series of very small segments in a smooth arc or complex curve, the 8bit firmware will likely choke on the required command processing rate and introduce stuttering to the print. These incredibly brief pauses allow residual pressure in the extruder to push out some extra plastic, making a little zit on the print. So most slicers automatically decimate curves and output gcode with reduced resolution to lighten the load on the firmware. Problem solved, right?</p>

<p>But there's another issue -- the GRBL motion control algorithms underlying all the major open source 3D printer controllers were designed with lots of shortcuts and hacks to allow 8bit processors to execute fast enough. For example, the basic algorithm only looks at the speed or velocity change at the corner between two segments, and uses that to decide when to decelerate/accelerate along the direction of motion. It does not calculate or consider centripetal/radial acceleration whatsoever. This is a really effective hack when printing boxy, low-res models, but it fails miserably on smooth curves with lots of little segments. The firmware does not detect any appreciable velocity change at the corner of any two nearly-linear segments within the faceted curve, and thus does not slow down for the curve. So complex geometry is effectively printed at constant velocity, with no acceleration.</p>

<p>Printing complex perimeters unaccelerated means the commanded feedrate must be very low to get good quality. Most printers are limited to about 40mm/s or less on complex perimeters, despite being able to run perhaps 80-120mm/s on low-complexity infill before hitting other speed limits.</p>

<p>Between the command processing rate limits and motion planner shortcomings required by low power processors, print speeds must be much lower in practice than is strictly required by the physics and printer hardware. This all comes from 8bit processors. The workarounds and best practices to deal with this problem are so deeply baked into the toolchains and ecosystem that very few people realize there is even a problem. But it's a real limit that can be overcome: a high-speed processor running a more rigorous motion planner could generate higher average print speeds with <em>better</em> print quality. </p>

<p>That said, the ARM-based firmwares are only slowly moving towards more advanced motion planners. This is a big development area right now that is actually driving an upcoming shift away from low-end ARMs like the Cortex M3 towards even faster processors. It's actually not all that hard to max out an 84 MHz Arduino Due by piling on a bunch of firmware features. </p>

<p>The use of 8bit processors also makes printers LOUDER. The biggest consumer of processor time in a typical 8bit printer is the stepper interrupt that fires the step pulses to make the motors move. It is quite typical for >60% of all clock cycles on an Atmega AVR to go to firing step pulses. Because this occurs as an interrupt, other processing tasks that the printer must perform -- like acceleration calculations and heater control -- get squeezed into the brief spaces between stepper interrupt events. </p>

<p>Without careful firmware design, the step pulses will completely ""crowd out"" other functionality like LCD display updates and acceleration calculations. In order to allow higher motion rates without using all the processor resources, 8bit firmwares have a mode called ""step doubling"" that fires two (or four, or eight) step pulses per stepper interrupt so that half (or a quarter, or an eighth) as many stepper interrupts can be used to produce the same motion speed. This practice de-bottlenecks the processor, but it causes rougher and louder motor motion because the step pulses are fired in bursts rather than a constant frequency. In effect, the microstepping level of the motor is functionally dropped to a coarser mode when the stepper interrupt fires double or quad steps. So the motors get louder, less precise, and in extreme cases may have problems with resonance. </p>

<p>An interesting side effect is that if you switch a Marlin-based printer from 1/16 microstepping to 1/32 microstepping, and keep the same print speeds, the firmware will simply start step-doubling, dropping your effective microstepping level right back down to 1/16.</p>

<p>ARM-based firmwares also use step doubling, but the allowable step rates are typically ~8 times higher before double/quad stepping is used. That can mean higher speeds and/or smoother motion. </p>

<p>Another issue with 8bit AVRs is the lack of hardware floating point and need to spend many clock cycles on high-precision calculations or handling very large numbers. Delta kinematics, auto-leveling functions, calculating moves with extremely high step counts for large printers, and other advanced functionality all take a <strong>lot</strong> of clock cycles on an 8bit processor. Poor firmware design or carelessly adding a feature that requires a few extra square roots and trig functions can completely bog down the processor. This kind of feature creep and code bloat has seriously impacted Marlin's performance over time as people ask more and more of the old AVR. </p>

<p>In comparison, a 32bit processor doesn't just have a faster clock and more clock cycles, it is also able to do much more complex math in fewer clock cycles, because it has dedicated hardware functionality that takes care of many of the steps an 8bit processor must do in software. </p>

<p>Do 8bit processors work? Sure, they work surprisingly well for what they are and what we ask of them. But they unquestionably limit the performance and features of modern 3D printers. Even today's current generation of 32bit processors is already being maxed out by high speed printers and math-heavy features. The 8bit processor is already two generations behind what would qualify as a ""modern"" 3D printer controller. </p>

"<p>everyone.</p>

<p>I'm a relative newcomer to 3D printing, so I don't know what constitutes an unacceptably bad spool of filament.</p>

<p>About 1/6 of the way into a roll of PETG (and maybe 4 hours into a 6-hour print), an over/under wrap brought things to a screeching halt. I aborted the print, then snipped the filament and started unspooling it, looking for more cross-wraps. I found a ton of them, along with a ton of kinks.</p>

<p>I stopped about 1/3 of the way into the spool, still finding kinks and cross-wraps, and said to heck with it. The only way to use it would have been to run the entire length onto another spool, carefully avoiding cross-wraps, and hope the kinks wouldn't affect the print quality.</p>

<p>I complained to the supplier but never even got a reply, so now I'm wondering if this is just one of those things I can expect from time to time. Any thoughts &amp; opinions would be much appreciated.</p>

"<p>Filament should come off of the roll without overlapping itself.  That being said depending on what you paid for it would determine if you should complain.  Normally you get what you pay for.  If you paid $10 for it, I would think that is why it was so cheap, but if you paid >$25 it should be nice stuff.</p>
"
"<p>Sorry to say it, but MOST wrap-unders are caused by end-users releasing the free end of the filament when handling the spool. It is mathematically impossible to introduce a knot during initial spooling, and all the reputable filament vendors these days have pretty careful free-end control when the spool is taken off the spooler and sent to packaging.</p>

<p>Where you may get knots straight from the filament vendor is if they're respooling very carelessly and let go of the free end. You should only see this with very cheap filament. </p>

<p>So, it's possible that your vendor messed up, but you should probably rule out your own handling practices first. It's not hard to prevent losing the free end. The nicer spool styles these days have holes on the side-flanges for securing the free end during handling/storage. Or you can print one of many, many filament clip designs from Thingiverse or your favorite model site. </p>

<p>If you're very careful with handling and still get knots, switch suppliers. Anyone sloppy enough to repeatedly mis-handle new spools is likely also using extremely cheap material, and there have been a lot of anecdotal reports of very nasty industrial chemicals being mixed into the colorants of low-cost filament. </p>

"<p>I'd recommend starting with connecting your printer(s) to OctoPi. From there, try to find either an API or way to create your own plugin. Then just set up a workstation that will manage your print queue and delegate the prints using some form of web request.</p>

<p>I personally don't recommend creating your own slicing engine.

<p><strong>So if the 3-D printer was able to print small objects, would a novice be able to do such a thing?</strong></p>

<p>Please let me know if any additional details are needed. </p>

"<p>1) If we're talking about FFF/FDM printers:</p>

<p>Accuracy of the electronics and motors allows it, yes.
But how FDM printers work it might be very hard to lay down layers of molten plastic so small as to preserve little details in the X and Y axis, not much of a problem doing 20 micron layer height though (Z resolution).
Check this answer to find out what the X and Y resolution is and what it depends on: <a href=""http://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/a/509/381"">http://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/a/509/381</a></p>

<p>You'll need both a small enough nozzle, as well as somehow cool the plastic because since the printed objects are so tiny the nozzle keeps contact with the surface surrounding it and heats it longer, which might melt the whole object or even char it.</p>

<p>I've seen very few people do tiny prints with success. And the smallest nozzles I know are 250 micron.
Not trying to dscourage you, just letting you know. If it was easy to do I think more people would be doing it and more companies would be advertising their printers as capable of such a thing</p>

<p>So you'll have around 20 micron Z resolution and around maybe 200 in the X/Y.
If that's enough for you, then you could try. Calibrating it all won't be easy, tiniest backlash will be noticeable.</p>

<p>2) It's a lot easier with curing resin 3d printers (SLA or DLP). Most of them actually have trouble printing larger objects, ironically (trouble sticking to the bed and cracking of the 3d print).
Even here badly calibrated lasers would prevent you from doing this and even many Form 1 users have reported their lasers being assembled poorly resulting in poor beam profile.</p>

<p>Size of the laser beam profile (aka laser ""spot size"") is what determines the X/Y resolution for SLA 3d printers. With the Form 2 its 140 micron, unless you'll get a badly calibrated printer.
For DLP printers it's easier, it's the resolution of the DLP projector divided from the size of the print area.</p>
"
"<p>Strictly by looking at the technical specifications of an FDM printer, there are a few things to note regarding the <em>maximum print quality</em> you can expect to achieve: </p>

<ul>
<li>The <strong>minimum layer height</strong>  - here given to be <em>0.1 mm</em></li>
<li>The <strong>nozzle diameter</strong>  - here given to be <em>0.4 mm</em></li>
</ul>

<h3>Minimum layer height:</h3>

<p>On a finished print, the minimum layer height will affect how visible the horisontal lines of the print will be. Printing at a lower layer height can dramatically increase the smoothness of the finished part, while equally increasing the printing time - among several other things.</p>

<p>A minimum layer height of 0.1 mm is fairly common for low-cost desktop FDM printers.</p>

<h3>Nozzle diameter:</h3>

<p>Just like the layer height defines the vertical resolution of a print, the nozzle diameter defines the sharpness of horizontal features of a print. </p>

<p>When printing with a large nozzle diameter, all sharp edges and corners of the model will have a slight roundness to them: the larger the nozzle diameter, the more rounded sharp corners will be, and vice versa. You might think of it as making a detailed drawing with a blunt pencil.</p>

<p>A nozzle diameter of 0.4 mm can perhaps be considered the standard for desktop FDM printers today, and will allow you to print ""fairly accurate"" parts.</p>

<h3>Will the daVinci work for you?</h3>

<p>Since I've never worked with the daVinci printer before, I cannot make a statement on it's user friendliness, or actual performance. </p>

<p>In general, if you intend to use it to print fragile, complex models such as insects, I believe a resin based printer might be more right for you, since they typically will allow for much higher reproduction of details than FDM printers. Printing solid/compact structures like coins and nuts, on the other hand, can typically be handled by a well calibrated FDM printer.  </p>

Older Makerbots use a small voltage divider circuit on the HBP PCB to convert the thermistor resistance to a voltage signal, whereas RepRap style controllers typically have this circuit on the mainboard and thus need only a simple thermistor hookup. You could add a new thermistor, or modify the existing circuit, or get an entirely new heatbed. </li>
<li>The existing endstops are full +5v,GND,Signal style mechanical switches with debounce capacitors and LED indicators. These <em>should</em> be compatible with <em>most</em> controller boards given proper firmware setting, but you may need to do some creative wiring if there isn't a suitable three-pin endstop port on your chosen board.</li>
<li>The LCD and 5-button panel will not work with other boards. You'll need to replace that or just run a remote host via USB.</li>
<li>Connectors may be different, of course. That's always an issue with any board swap. </li>
<li>You will need to export RepRap style gcode instead of .x3g files. Makerware/Desktop can export gcode but there may be some minor differences in Mcode assignments from what most RepRap style firmware will expect. I couldn't tell you offhand whether this will work, but to be safe, it would probably be best to use a more traditional RepRap slicer (Slic3r, Cura) or Simplify3D.</li>
</ol>

<p>So that's a healthy to-do list. At a certain point you're practically building a new printer. <strong>But there is a significantly easier approach</strong> than installing a RepRap style controller: replace the dead Makerbot Mightyboard with a compatible community-designed Sailfish board like the Azteeg x3 by Panucatt or new CloneBoard Mini by Carl Raffle. Or, if you're ok with Chinese sourcing, a FlashForge Mightyboard will be a near 100% drop-fit replacement for your Makerbot Mightyboard. Any of these options will give you fresh new electronics with minimal hardware changes in the rest of the printer. </p>

<p>Either way is fine and you'll end up with a working printer. Using another Sailfish board will certainly be easier, if you don't object to staying within the Sailfish/x3g toolchain and Makerbot/Clone parts ecosystem. Makerbot does have a very bad community reputation these days, but it's important to remember that the Replicator 1 Dual is a completely open-source machine from the ""pre-evil"" days, and compatible spare parts are widely available from literally dozens of vendors. The Rep1-derived Makerbots and Clones collectively comprise the most popular single ""flavor"" of 3d printer in the world (totaling as much as perhaps a quarter of all consumer/hobbyist 3d printers sold to date) and many/most of the spare parts for Replicator 2/2x's and clones will also fit in a genuine Rep1. </p>

"<p>What is the cheapest (<strong>tabletop</strong>) 3D printer that you can get right now ?
Is there a current price list? ( with different vendors )</p>
"
"<p>The peer-based 3D printing service called <a href=""https://www.3dhubs.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">3D Hubs</a> conducted a survey of its users and which printers they use and suggest. This survey's results are <a href=""https://www.3dhubs.com/best-3d-printer-guide?utm_source=customerio&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=hubs_surveyed"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>.</p>

<p>I recall a similar Google Group conducting a similar survey a year or so ago, I'll search for the link to that as well a little later.</p>
"
"<p>I am considering buying a 3D printer for work (scientific research). On paper, the Makerbot 5th generation seems to be the best option, because the price is right for my budget, and also because I'm generally pretty busy, so I want something that's as close to ""plug and play"" as reasonably possible. This will be my first 3D printer and I have no prior experience with the technology.</p>

<p>However, any search for ""Makerbot"" brings up a raft of negative reviews from around the time of the 5th generation's first release, which mostly focus on issues with the smart extruder constantly failing and needing to be replaced under warranty. Many of these reviews point out that this may be an initial ""teething"" issue which might be fixed in later versions of the model, but now, one year later, I'm unable to find any information about whether this was indeed the case.</p>

<p>So: are the initial issues with the Makerbot 5th generation's smart extruder generally considered resolved, or is it an underlying flaw of the model that won't be fixed until the next generation?</p>

<p><sub>I imagine that people might want to suggest alternative models in the same price range. That would be welcome, but I have an extra constraint, which is that I can only buy models that are available in Japan without a long delivery time - this probably limits my options quite a bit.</sub></p>
"
"<p>I got (with no prior experience) a 5th generation model soon after its release and indeed had painful troubles with the extruder and had it replaced under warranty. Firmware from late 2014 on has produced much better results.
It still needs far more work than -- say -- a laser printer, but that might be simply part of the technology.</p>

<p>Overall thus my answer is ""yes"".</p>

<p>I also just noted this week that Makerbot is about to rebase an improved Extruder+ that claims to further reduce clogging problems.</p>
"
"<p>Makerbot claims the problems are fixed. I have heard from a number of resellers that the problems are fixed. Unfortunately, both of those are somewhat biased sources. It's surprisingly hard to get good info on the subject -- very few credible people are talking about recent experiences with the product line. </p>

<p><strong>Issue #1:</strong> The main surviving user forum (<a href=""https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/makerbot-users"">https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/makerbot-users</a>) has had the torrent of people reporting 5th gen issues more or less dry up. There ARE still people posting issues, but at a fairly low level that is not far outside what you would expect for an average hobbyist printer. What we DON'T know is whether the flood of complaints has slowed because they're working better, or because very few people are actually buying them any more. </p>

<p><strong>Issue #2:</strong> The power-users and community leaders that typically evaluate and review 3d printers are all avoiding the 5th gen line like the plague. Makerbot burned up a lot of community good-will by going closed source with the Replicator 2, and lost more good-will through a series of misunderstandings over patent applications and the Thingiverse terms of service (Takerbot scandals), and put the nail in the coffin by <strong>knowingly</strong> releasing a non-functional 5th gen product line. Very few credible people are willing to give them a chance at this point, so there is a severe shortage of unbiased reviews.</p>

<p><strong>Issue #3:</strong> Makerbot has a proven history of buying off journalists and reviewers to get positive 5th gen press. Some verifiable examples:</p>

<ul>
<li>Hundreds of fake 5-star Amazon reviews from paid review accounts. A relevant analysis: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JI8LRRXZYNX1/"">http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JI8LRRXZYNX1/</a> (Not verified, but related: a widely-believed rumor states that the German Amazon site actually wiped all of Makerbot's 5th Gen reviews because of blatant tampering: <a href=""http://www.amazon.de/MakerBot-MP05825-Replicator-5th-H%C3%B6he/dp/B0183TP806/"">http://www.amazon.de/MakerBot-MP05825-Replicator-5th-H%C3%B6he/dp/B0183TP806/</a>)</li>
<li>The CES awards initially given to the 5th Gen line were given before Makerbot had functional firmware. None of the 5th Gens at the CES launch were functional. All demo prints shown were made on Replicator 2s. How could a non-functional product win awards? Not hard to figure that one out. </li>
<li>Historical positive press in the 3DP journalism media (3ders, Make Magazine, etc) has been directly proportional to the volume of ad-buys from Makerbot or the parent company Stratasys. </li>
</ul>

<p>I could keep going, but you get the idea. </p>

<p>So it's hard to evaluate the reality of the situation. <strong>But even IF the Smart Extruder issues are truly all fixed</strong> (jams, leveling issues, thermocouple connection, filament encoder failures, etc), <strong>there are still meaningful problems with the product line.</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>The print quality is not impressive. The motion mechanics, which have not been appreciably changed to my knowledge, are not great. The Smart Extruder is basically a giant pendulum wobbling off the side of a non-optimal gantry selection of an H-bot architecture. Makerbot has addressed the floppy construction via firmware tweaks to significantly slow down the machine to give marginally-acceptable print quality. According to most reports I have seen, a Replicator 5th Gen will print significantly slower than a Replicator 2, for example. Expect in the neighborhood of perhaps 30-40% longer print times than comparable printers.</li>
<li>The price tag is roughly double or even triple the current market price for the size and print quality output of the machine. There are so many great printers on the market now for significantly less money that it's kind of nuts to drop the cash on a Makerbot.</li>
<li>It is marketed as a PLA-only machine. That's fine if you're printing art and trinkets, but it's not a great option for mechanical parts. While you CAN print other materials, this is not technically supported. </li>
<li>The support plan structure has quite frankly become abusive. Makerbot used to have really helpful phone tech support, but the crushingly massive volume of 5th gen troubleshooting requests forced them into a paid tech support model. Around the same time, Makerbot shut down their user community forum and deleted links to external technical resources off their website. So unless you know the right places to go, support is scarce. For official tech support you must buy ""Makercare"" or pay for each help ticket. This is completely out of line with industry norms for a hobbyist/consumer 3d printer. They essentially took their biggest liability -- unreliable printers -- and tried to twist it into a profit center. I personally think this is a significant reason to avoid the company entirely.  </li>
</ul>

<p>Is it possible to get good results from a Replicator 5th Gen? Sure. But it's a poor value for the cost, from a company that has spent the last few years systematically driving away its former loyal user base. I would recommend staying away until there's some significant change in the product line at minimum.</p>

"<p>I have used Wings 3D (<a href=""http://www.wings3d.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wings3d.com</a>) for just that purpose. It is very easy to use, and has many other useful functions built in. Not only can you reform the mesh, but you also you have the ability to import and export many other meshes such as .obj, and etc. When you have completed your modifications you can export them in one of several formats (I find it easier to just keep it in .stl) and then use netfab (also has a free version with some limitations as compared to the paid version) to fine tune the mesh if it is not printable in its current format. Wings will export your modifications in .stl format, but you may have to fine tune to get rid of holes blemishes and etc., and you can view your changes in several views such as Gaussian and other forms. </p>

<p>If you decide to try Wings 3D you need to go through the tutorials, since there is a multitude of possibilities, including making your own meshes, beginning with several basic forms such as squares, cubes, cylinders and several other basic geometrical figures.</p>

<p>Using these two programs I have been able to modify many meshes and arrive at a very printable object. One of the features of Wings which has been quite valuable is the smoothing app which reduces the sharp division lines on some models.</p>

<p>Since both programs are free you can try them and uninstall them if they do not fill your needs. Blender is also an excellent free program, but I find Wings to be much simpler to use.</p>

<p>Hope this helps   </p>

"<p>Due to a not-given compatibility with Makerbot mechanical endstop wiring (and carelessness on my side) I ended up burning the voltage regulator on my Arduino Mega 2560. Now, powering the Arduino separately from a USB power supply, I can operate the electronics, however, I am still unable to receive any signal from the endstops and I don't want to hook up my replacement Arduino until I see that my wiring is correct.</p>

<p>Could I have burnt anything else on either the Arduino (pullup resistors were firmware disabled) or the RAMPS 1.4 which makes it impossible to receive a singal from the endstops?</p>

"<p>Take a look at Ryan's answer to <a href=""http://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/588/is-it-possible-to-use-an-aftermarket-controller-on-a-makerbot"">my question</a>. I believe the MightBoard is based on the Mega 2560, so it is possible that some of the other components could have been damaged. If you look at the comments below Ryan's answer, we discussed the possibility of the processor itself being damaged. I had attempted <a href=""http://coolate.com/blog/blog/2015/02/23/its-alive-makerbot-replicator-repaired/"" rel=""nofollow"">this fix</a> on two different MightBoards and they both ended up turning on, but the firmware wouldn't boot. So, it's safe to say that in my case, the processor on the Arduino was shot.</p>

<p>All and all, I'd recommend not using MakerBot's endstops as they seem to be the main culprit for this issue and has been for years (it happened to me twice since I got my machine in 2012).</p>

"<p>While I've worked on fixing my voltage regulator on my MightyBoard, I've noticed an extra set of pins available labeled <a href=""http://www.geeetech.com/wiki/images/thumb/8/88/Signal_polarity_scheme_Of_mightyboard.png/500px-Signal_polarity_scheme_Of_mightyboard.png"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""Atmega 1280 IO"">Atmega 1280 IO</a>. I've tried finding documentation on what these pin can be used for to no avail.

<p>Any links to documentation on this subject would be greatly appreciated.</p>

"<p>If you check the Mightyboard RevE files on Thingiverse (<a href=""http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:16058/#files"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:16058/#files</a>) you will find the schematics and PCB files (.sch and .brd) for the version of the board used in Replicator 1s and (with some minor mods) most clones. The Atmega 1280 IO header section is a bunch of breakout pins for debug functions. There are eight sets of signal/5v/gnd groupings. Four of them are currently driving debug LEDs that show flash codes for particular firmware failure modes. The other four are unused as far as I'm aware. </p>

<p>The ninth and tenth pins shown in the schematic are located on the opposite end of the board, near the 8U2 chip, to give some hacking access to that chip as well. (The 8U2 handles USB comms and firmware flashing the Atmega 1280.)</p>

<p>If desired, you can build your own firmware using these pins for other purposes, such as signaling to external equipment. But building Sailfish is a little more difficult than just running the latest Arduino IDE (for compiler stability reasons) so the vast majority of Mightyboard users never bother modifying their firmware.</p>

"<p>I have a Printrbot Simple Metal. The extruder is getting clogged all the time. I went through the process demonstrated <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_qP5AsnQNQ"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a> multiple times already. Heatting the extruder and pushing different tools all the way through to make sure it is completely clear. 
Every time I get a clear flow of PLA, and after a few minutes the extruder motor starts clicking again. At that point, it is even hard to push in the filament by hand.<br>
I replaced the tip already, but this didn't make any difference. I also tried few different filaments, all of them worked perfectly before.<br>
It feels like stopping the flow even for about 30 seconds would cause it to jam.</p>
"
"<p>I'm not sure if this is particularly the issue for you right now, but I have encountered the tension on my drive gear being too high.</p>

<p>Before I upgraded my extruder to the spring loaded mechanism, my extruder used a Delrin plunger to provide tension against the filament towards the drive gear. This plunger used copper washers to help adjust the tension required. Many people ended up upgrading their assemblies to the spring loaded mechanism as the plunger would either put too much or too little tension against the drive gear. Too little and the filament will not be driven into the hotend. Too much and the filament will grind against the drive gear and the drive gear may begin to ""eat"" away at the filament (especially when the filament becomes hotter). Obviously, if the drive gear is no longer able to catch on the filament, the nozzle will get clogged.</p>

<p>However, even with a spring mechanism, your tension can become too high. Most of these mechanisms allow you to adjust the tension by tightening/loosening the screw holding down the spring. The ""sweet spot"" for me is just past when the filament can be successfully driven into the hotend. You can test this if you have control over your extrusion motor by removing the extrusion motor from its mount, leaving the spring mechanism installed on the face of the motor. Then, turn your motor on and try feeding the filament through the mechanism. Starting with no tension on the spring, begin slowly increasing tension by tightening the screw on your mechanism until the drive gear is successfully able to guide the filament through. I might even complete another half turn on the screw to account for varying diameters and plasticity states of the filament as it becomes hot.</p>

<p>Hopefully this helps and please keep us updated on anything else you find.</p>

"<p>There are many types of pigments made for paint, food, fabric, cosmetic and finally plastic pigments. I guess we need pigments made for plastic, or at least pigments which won't decompose, burn or lose their properties at the temperatures inside the filament extrusion machines (around 240C).</p>

<p>So what type of pigment are we looking for (does that type have a name?) and where can they be found (off-the-shelf from some specialized paint store or is it a more specialized pigment for plastics which is harder to source)?</p>
"
"<p>The normal way pigment is added to filament (or any other extruded plastic product) is by mixing ""masterbatch"" pellets containing a high concentration of dye with the raw resin pellets. (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masterbatch"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masterbatch</a>) This is significantly easier and more reliable than trying to mix raw pigments into the plastic -- the likelihood of clumping and other issues is greatly reduced.</p>

<p>You can buy these masterbatch pellets and mix up colors in whatever ratios you want to achieve specific output colors. Just make sure the masterbatch pellet carrier material is compatible with your resin. There are a wide variety of vendors, including ebay. </p>

"<p>Are there general rules on how much a colored filament vs vanilla filament affects the print results, what is affected and how those values should be changed in the slicer to achieve more similar results between different color/ colored vs pure filament spools?</p>
"
"<p>You have several options:</p>

<p><strong>1)</strong> <strong>Printing with filaments made up of plastic and metal powder mix</strong>. Bronzefill is one example: <a href=""http://colorfabb.com/bronzefill"" rel=""nofollow"">http://colorfabb.com/bronzefill</a>
While most may argue it doesn't look much like bronze or copper and rather clay, it can made to by some automatic polishing methods:</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AU8WvGveNj4"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AU8WvGveNj4</a></p>

<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDoYO22103Q"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDoYO22103Q</a></p>

<p>Some don't like the idea of having a plastic and metal powder mixture and they say if it's not pure bronze/some other alloy it might as well be painted. Which is the second option:</p>

<p><strong>2)</strong> <strong>Spray painting an ABS or PLA print with metal color spray paint.</strong> You might need to sand or acetone bath the print first for the paint to be applied evenly.</p>

<p><strong>3)</strong> <strong>Metal plating</strong> can be done for more realstic texture. </p>

<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PnlZ4MTfCk"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PnlZ4MTfCk</a>
The 3d print should again be sanded/polished first.</p>

<p><strong>4)</strong> The first method of getting actual metal object from a plastic object: <strong>Printing with a metal clay</strong>, then firing it in a kiln. You'll need an appropriate extruder which can extrude paste instead of filament:
<a href=""http://www.thingiverse.com/search?q=metal+clay+extruder&amp;sa="" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thingiverse.com/search?q=metal+clay+extruder&amp;sa=</a>
There are 3d printers that can do that officially.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.davidhartkop.com/cms/?q=Home"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.davidhartkop.com/cms/?q=Home</a>
You'll need a kiln...</p>

<p><strong>5)</strong> Second method of getting actual metal object from a plastic object, via <strong>metal casting</strong> (""lost polymer casting""). From all the above options this is the most dangerous if you're not experienced, skilled and careful.</p>

"
"<p>At this point in time I don't think there is a need to be concerned with purity of filaments based on pigmentation.</p>

<p>For the most part, variations in filament quality due to coloring should be the least of your concerns compared to some of the other variables such as quality of the pellets, extrusion temperature (when manufactured), cooling rate (after extrusion), handling/storage, etc.</p>

<p>Also, assuming your focused on consumer 3D printer use, the typical hardware components aren't equipped to be accurate enough to make fine adjustments with regard to the quality range driven by filament color. Even if there were capable, accurate extruder(s) installed, I think you would need a well designed feedback loop to ensure that you're reading temperatures along the full extrusion process (drive, melt, extrude, etc).</p>

<p>I believe what you're asking involves more material science expertise, from a design aspect.</p>

<p>However, I believe that the more ""color"" you have obviously reduces the purity of the material and thusly the material properties can suffer. Such properties as thermal resistance found in PLA and ABS. So theoretically if you have Black filament, you'll want to extrude with a lower temperature than you would with a natural ""White"" filament. I would think that the necessary difference in temperature would be a few degrees (Celsius). However, there are many other factors, such as moisture and manufacturing techniques that can take precedence over color differences.</p>

<p>My advice, figure out how to ""cheaply"" analyze your material and ensure you have an accurate temperature feedback loop. If can you do that, you'll be able to drastically change the quality of consumer 3D printing.</p>

"<p>I am wondering about the speed that my steppers should achieve in regular operation and what the determining factors are, from theoretical hardware facts/limits to software limitations that can influence performance.</p>

<p>I do know about the basic properties of stepper motors such as the torque relation with speed, which I read some while ago from this source (for anyont stumbling into this question later):
<a href=""https://www.geckodrive.com/gecko/images/cms_files/Step%20Motor%20Basics%20Guide.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.geckodrive.com/gecko/images/cms_files/Step%20Motor%20Basics%20Guide.pdf</a></p>

<p>So far Wikipedia (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stepper_motor"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stepper_motor</a>) easily turns up the following statements with regard to my question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Thus when controlled by an L/R drive, the maximum speed of a stepper
  motor is limited by its inductance since at some speed, the voltage U
  will be changing faster than the current I can keep up.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and  for chopper drivers:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This requires additional electronics to sense winding currents, and
  control the switching, but it allows stepper motors to be driven with
  higher torque at higher speeds than L/R drives</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Obviously the amount of steps/revelation will change the speed, too</p>

<p>However, all this does not help me to determine what the real life speed of my stepper should be. Additional firmware parameters clutter up my (beginner's) brain even more (and I haven't had a too deep dive into that yet).
In general I understand that the frequency we use to send the steps to the stepper is the main determining factor, also 'reduced' by microstepping, if applied. We cannot keep the current up as much as needed due to timing/inductive/electronic properties of the motors, so we lose torque or finally steps. A higher voltage helps to bring the current up faster, so the steepness of the current increase can also limit the maximum applicable frequency. The frequency itself is given from the controller board to the motor driver, hence is set in firmware.</p>

<p>All in all, apart from what makes sense to utilize in a 3D printer setup, what are the determining factors of the stepper speeds that can be realized and how to they transform into real life values for our printers? Also I'd be interested in how the determining factors influence the reliability and print quality regardless of the mechanical difficulties that arise with print-speed.</p>

<p>However, I think the question here is relevant and specific enough for 3D printing to exist here alongside.</p>
"
"<p>This used to happen to me and my Simple Metal often. 
The jam was always caused by one of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Feed rate too high (especially on solid layers or long lines)</li>
<li>Temperature too low</li>
<li>Nozzle pushing into previous layer, causing back pressure</li>
<li>Variance in filament diameter</li>
</ul>

<p>Personally, I have never printed at 195c. I'm always about 225 or 230.
That may seem high for PLA, but then I have stopped having the issues after slowing the print and raising the temperature from 200.</p>

<p>You want to strike the right balance between speed and temp. The slower the feed rate, the lower you can afford to lower the temperature. I think you should start by raising the temperature to 215 and slightly lowering the feedrate.</p>

<p>Also, I have directed a fan at my extruder motor and filament as it enters the nozzle. Keeps the motor very cool and stops the filament softening too early.</p>

<p>Is there a foreign object blocking the nozzle, or does it seem like the filament isn't heating up enough?</p>

"<p>The four main motor speed limits in a 3d printer are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Firmware step generation frequency limits</li>
<li>Firmware motion planner effects</li>
<li>Loss of torque and precision due to motor coil inductance and back-EMF effects</li>
<li>Mid-band resonance</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Step generation rate limits</strong> will depend on the firmware and controller board used. There is a significant range, particularly when 32bit firmwares and RTOS-based platforms like MachineKit are compared to 8bit firmwares running on Atmega AVRs. Some examples:</p>

<ul>
<li>Marlin on a 16 MHz 8bit Atmega can only run the stepper interrupt at 10,000 hz without bogging down the processor and blocking other critical algorithms (like motion planning). It can fire step rates up to 40,000 hz by pulsing the step line two or four times per interrupt, which effectively drops the microstep level in software and runs the motors rougher/louder. </li>
<li>Repetier on the same Atmega can run the stepper interrupt at 12,000 hz, because it is optimized more for execution speed than Marlin.</li>
<li>Repetier on an 84 MHz 32bit ARM Cortex-M3 can run the stepper interrupt at 80,000 Hz.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>These limits typically only affect actual stepper speed when relatively fine microstepping is used.</em> Consider an example based on a very typical Marlin printer configuration. Microstepping of at least 1/4 is strongly recommended to avoid resonance issues, so let's start with 1/16 stepping. This allows quad-stepping to effectively output 1/4-steps. Starting with finer microstepping will drop our top speed, and coarser microstepping will be louder and may encounter resonance, so this is a good starting point. Then asssume a typical 32mm-per-rev pulley on a 1.8 degree (200 steps/rev) stepper motor. This system has a resolution of 200*16/32= 100 steps/mm. At 40,000 Hz total stepping rate (quad-stepping at 10,000 Hz) we can theoretically travel at 400 mm/s before hitting Marlin's hard cap. That's probably going to be a higher RPM than we want to run the motor anyway, so it's not a very impactful limit. </p>

<p>In comparison, if we started at 1/128 stepping (such as with the THB6128 driver chip) our top speed with 8bit Marlin would be 50 mm/s. That's quite slow. </p>

<p><strong>Firmware motion planners</strong> can further limits motor speed by ramping up and down to traverse turns and corners. If the model geometry has lots of sharp turns, the target speeds commanded by the gcode are likely to never actually be reached. Only long, straight line paths will have enough ramping time to hit the speed target. You can see this yourself by printing a very small model at a variety of feedrates and timing the actual print duration: at a certain point, increases in the commanded speed will make no difference on actual print times.</p>

<p>Another constraint some firmwares enforce is requiring the ability to safely decelerate to a stop within the length of all the motion commands in the planner queue. This allows the printer to gracefully handle a sudden loss of input, such as as if the host computer stops transmitting USB commands, or if the SD card experiences a series of read errors. If the printer just abruptly stops from full speed when it runs out of commands, it is likely to lose position and ruin the print. Whereas if it can decelerate to a safe stopping speed, it may be able to resume after the command stream resumes. </p>

<p>In terms of actual motor behavior, the <strong>inductance and back-EMF</strong> introduce significant limits because they decrease motor torque at higher RPMs. This produces a torque/RPM curve that drops off at higher speeds:</p>

<p><a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/BHxwY.jpg""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/BHxwY.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a>
<a href=""http://www.geckodrive.com/support/step-motor-basics.html"">http://www.geckodrive.com/support/step-motor-basics.html</a></p>

<p>Note in the picture that there is a flat ""constant current"" region on the left side at low speeds. This is the range where the chopping driver is limiting coil current. On the right side of the curve, current is not able to reach the target before it must be switched back off for the next step. That reduces field strength and thus torque.</p>

<p>There are two separate effects to consider here:</p>

<ul>
<li>Motor coils are inductors, which means there is a first-order lag between applied voltage and coil current. A standard bipolar stepper motor with a microstepping driver must raise the coil current from zero to max or from max to zero every full step (eg every sixteen 1/16th microsteps). At high step rates, there is not enough time to fully charge the coil to its max current before the next step requires dropping the current back down. Without developing full coil current on each step, torque is lost. </li>
<li>Every motor is also a generator, and spinning the rotor generates back-EMF voltage within the motor coils. That voltage waveform gets overlaid on top of the drive voltage waveform with a phase shift dependent on the rotor position relative to the coil energization position. <em>In simple terms, this voltage attempts to brake the motor:</em> it always does whatever will slow the motor down. This means it opposes the applied drive voltage when the motor is applying forward torque, or assists the applied drive voltage when the motor is applying brake torque. </li>
</ul>

<p>For a practical discussion of speed limits, we can simplify the situation by assuming back-EMF voltage opposes the drive voltage applied to the coils. This means there is less effective voltage raising/lowering coil current, and it takes longer for the current to change, and less coil current is developed than would be the case without back-emf. This further depresses the torque/RPM curve of the motor. And when the back-EMF voltage is around the same magnitude as the drive voltage, significant motor instability can result because of complex feedback effects between rotor position and effective coil voltage. </p>

<p>You can play with these effects using different motor configurations and speeds for a few popular 3D printer stepper drivers using my stepper driver simulator: <a href=""https://github.com/rcarlyle/StepperSim"">https://github.com/rcarlyle/StepperSim</a> </p>

<p>In closed-loop applications with position feedback and high-end drivers that can damp various instability modes, it may be ok to run the stepper all the way down the torque curve at very high RPMs. In more typical open-loop 3D printer applications, it's generally best to stick to the low-RPM part of the torque curve before inductance and back-EMF really take over the motor behavior. Losing too much torque can easily mean skipping steps and losing position, ruining the print. </p>

<p>Another important effect for steppers is <strong>mid-band resonance</strong>. This is not a normal mechanical resonance, but actually an electromechanical resonance effect. It's quite complicated, but the short explanation is that a stepper has an intrinsic 90-degree phase shift between position and torque, and when speeds rise to a point where coil inductance introduces an additional 90-degree phase shift between coil current and applied voltage, the electromechanical system has a highly-unstable 180-degree phase lag and thus creates a negative feedback loop. This can rapidly drop motor torque until the motor loses synchronicity with the driver's applied voltage and stalls.</p>

<p>Mid-band resonance only occurs when coil current is limited by inductance. It cannot occur in the constant-current drive range because there is not enough phase lag between applied voltage and coil current.</p>

<p><a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/ZO8nN.jpg""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/ZO8nN.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a>
<a href=""http://www.geckodrive.com/support/step-motor-basics.html"">http://www.geckodrive.com/support/step-motor-basics.html</a></p>

<p>Unfortunately, measured torque curves available from manufacturers almost never show resonance zones, because the curves are produced by loading motors with friction-brakes that damp any kind of resonance effect from building. Whereas a 3D printer drivetrain load is almost entirely inertial (accelerating a mass) which is much more prone to resonance.</p>

<p>High-end drivers can automatically detect and damp mid-band resonance, but typical low-cost 3D printer drivers do not have this capability. </p>

<p>It is generally prudent to avoid entering an RPM range where mid-band resonance may occur. This is easily accomplished by sticking to the left side of the torque curve, in the constant-current operating region. This ensures high torque and good stability. </p>

<p>For a concrete example, consider the popular Kysan 1124090 stepper with a 24v power supply. </p>

<p><a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/SUFIv.jpg""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/SUFIv.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a>
<a href=""https://ultimachine.com/content/kysan-1124090-nema-17-stepper-motor"">https://ultimachine.com/content/kysan-1124090-nema-17-stepper-motor</a></p>

<p>To maintain high torque and avoid mid-band resonance, we would want to keep the RPM to about 400 or less. For the same 32mm-per-rev pulley mentioned above, that would limit speeds to around 200-240 mm/s. Higher speeds are possible, but may encounter reliability issues. </p>

<p>This speed, of course, assumes a 24v PSU is used, to match the measured torque curve: a 12v PSU would have a significantly lower top speed before inductance starts to limit coil current, around half as fast. Higher supply voltage <em>greatly</em> increases the top effective speed for the motor.</p>

<p>Again, you can easily simulate this effect if you know the back-EMF voltage per RPM for your motor. (Using <a href=""https://github.com/rcarlyle/StepperSim"">https://github.com/rcarlyle/StepperSim</a>) The back-EMF parameter is critical at higher speeds, but unfortunately, it is not typically provided in manufacturer datasheets. But it is very easy to measure by spinning the motor at a known RPM (such as with a drill press) and measuring the open-circuit RMS AC voltage across one of the coils. This simulator output chart shows how inductance and back-EMF are keeping coil current from reaching the target:</p>

<p><a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/GYMc7.jpg""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/GYMc7.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>For practical drivetrain design, a motor/driver simulator is really the best tool in the toolbox for finding the point where performance will start to degrade due to inability to hit current targets. It's simply too complex to apply simple equations or rules of thumb with any accuracy. These electrical effects and the firmware step generation limits are likely to be the two main restrictions on motor speed for most printers. </p>

<p>Of course, how fast you can melt plastic will tend to limit printing speeds significantly below the true motor speed limits, but that's a different discussion. For the moment, we can simply say that top motor speed tends to be unimportant for print moves in typical Cartesian printers. However, there are a few instances where they are likely to drive printer performance:</p>

<ul>
<li>Linear Deltas, where carriages may need to run several times faster than the effector for certain move directions</li>
<li>Geared extruders with high reduction ratio (eg much over 5:1) for high retraction speeds</li>
<li>Short-pitch lead screws (or all-thread) that need high rotation speeds to achieve moderate linear speeds</li>
</ul>

"<p>One way to give PLA prints a smooth finish is treatment with chloroform vapours (or other solvents, as mentioned in <a href=""http://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/a/36/674"">this</a> answer). This method is even featured on <a href=""https://ultimaker.com/en/tips-tricks/17897-vapor-treating"" rel=""nofollow"">Ultimaker website</a>. I would like to try it on some of my prints. </p>

<p>What are the practical concerns I should be aware of using chloroform vapours? I am looking for advice concerning vaporisation temperature, time of exposition that makes for a nice finish, and any other experiences. </p>

<p><strong>Caution!</strong>
<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chloroform"" rel=""nofollow"">Chloroform</a> is a moderately toxic chemical! I only approach this method as I have an access to a well-equipped chemical laboratory with a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fume_hood"" rel=""nofollow"">fume hood</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Disclamer:</strong>
The question is not about the safety issues using chloroform vapours. It is about how obtain the best post-processing results with least trial-and-error.</p>
"
"<p><a href=""http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:73120"" rel=""nofollow"">This Reddit post</a> seems to have some good trial and error dialog.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:73120"" rel=""nofollow"">This Thingiverse post</a>, along with many other references online, suggest that the results are very similar to that of an Acetone treatment with ABS. I'm not familiar with the inner workings of how it works, but the general advice is to be conscious of what you're working with. A heat-induced vapor treatment seems to yield the best surface finish, but can be tricky to track down proper exposure times. It seems that the time required to achieve a desirable surface finish depends on the size and openness of the features on the object. By openness, I mean how evenly the vapor is able attach itself to the surface of the object as compared to other features. Some this variability may be reduced by streamlining the process. Perhaps if you found a way to rotate either the part or the vapor container during the process. This could ensure contact is made in small corners/features. Other variables to consider may be:</p>

<ul>
<li>If a gradual reduction of exposure is necessary (as is with most heat treatment operations)</li>
<li>How much temperature effects time. Most pages I've read mention 100C as the temp to vaporize the chemical.</li>
<li>Size of the ""vaporization chamber"" in accordance with how much of the chemical is available. I've used a gallon paint can lined with lightly dabbed paper towel with Acetone for part between 1""^3 to about 4""^3</li>
</ul>

<p>That's all I can think of, currently, that could potentially have the most impact on the process. Just as with 3D printing, there's not an easy way to definitively know how your parts will turn out. The sheer difference in the shape of your parts could throw out any ""proven process"" you come up with. Hopefully this gives you an idea of what things to look out for in starting out.</p>

<p><em>Here's information about safety, before OP added disclaimer</em>
<s>As with any chemical, <strong>always</strong> refer to the MSDS <sup>(Material Safety Data Sheet)</sup>! Whichever supplier you acquire the chloroform from, should ship an MSDS with the product. If one is not shipped, you should be able to request one. If they don't have one, don't use the product and don't purchase from them.</p>

<p>In most cases, you can get away with finding any MSDS online, but I'd recommend trying to get one directly from your supplier as they might theoretically have a different ""strand"" of the chemical. Therefore, reactions and safety precautions may be different than what you will find online.</p>

<p>A quick search yields <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/3Dprinting/comments/25ej7d/does_anyone_have_experience_with_pla_thf_vapor/"" rel=""nofollow"">this MSDS</a> which states that chloroform does have ""carcinogenic effects"" along with some other long-term, undesirable effects. As with any other MSDS it continues to go over best-practices and extremity limits.

"<p>On a Cartesian printer movements are really simple. If we assume the printer has 100 steps/mm on each axis, then a move of 10mm on a axis is just 1000 Steps on that axis.</p>

<p>Movements that are not aligned with one axis are also simple. Moving from x,y = 0,0 to 10,10 would be 1000 steps on x and y.</p>

<p>On deltas even for simple moves more than one motor has to move. And just calculating the amount of steps on each axis needed to reach the destination probably gives a curved move.</p>

<p>So what is the algorithm to calculate the steps for a given move for a delta printer?</p>
"
"<p>I am describing how this is done in the Marlin firmware.</p>

<p>The first step is to split a linear movement from (x, y, z) to (x', y', z') into many discrete segments. To this end, the amount of time the move would take at a given speed is calculated, and the value <em>delta_segments_per_second</em> is used to calculate the number of segments used.</p>

<p>This is done in the function <em>prepare_move_delta</em> in the file Marlin_main.cpp. The endpoints of each of these segments is then passed to the function <em>calculate_delta</em>:</p>

<pre><code>void calculate_delta(float cartesian[3]) {
    //reverse kinematics.
    // Perform reversed kinematics, and place results in delta[3]
    // The maths and first version has been done by QHARLEY . Integrated into masterbranch 06/2014 and slightly restructured by Joachim Cerny in June 2014

    float SCARA_pos[2];
    static float SCARA_C2, SCARA_S2, SCARA_K1, SCARA_K2, SCARA_theta, SCARA_psi;

    SCARA_pos[X_AXIS] = cartesian[X_AXIS] * axis_scaling[X_AXIS] - SCARA_offset_x;  //Translate SCARA to standard X Y
    SCARA_pos[Y_AXIS] = cartesian[Y_AXIS] * axis_scaling[Y_AXIS] - SCARA_offset_y;  // With scaling factor.

    #if (Linkage_1 == Linkage_2)
      SCARA_C2 = ((sq(SCARA_pos[X_AXIS]) + sq(SCARA_pos[Y_AXIS])) / (2 * (float)L1_2)) - 1;
    #else
      SCARA_C2 = (sq(SCARA_pos[X_AXIS]) + sq(SCARA_pos[Y_AXIS]) - (float)L1_2 - (float)L2_2) / 45000;
    #endif

    SCARA_S2 = sqrt(1 - sq(SCARA_C2));

    SCARA_K1 = Linkage_1 + Linkage_2 * SCARA_C2;
    SCARA_K2 = Linkage_2 * SCARA_S2;

    SCARA_theta = (atan2(SCARA_pos[X_AXIS], SCARA_pos[Y_AXIS]) - atan2(SCARA_K1, SCARA_K2)) * -1;
    SCARA_psi = atan2(SCARA_S2, SCARA_C2);

    delta[X_AXIS] = SCARA_theta * SCARA_RAD2DEG;  // Multiply by 180/Pi  -  theta is support arm angle
    delta[Y_AXIS] = (SCARA_theta + SCARA_psi) * SCARA_RAD2DEG;  //       -  equal to sub arm angle (inverted motor)
    delta[Z_AXIS] = cartesian[Z_AXIS];

<p>This function takes care of the delta geometry and calculations needed to convert the (x,y,z) coordinates of the segment endpoints to corresponding positions for the carriages. The translated coordinates are then passed to <em>plan_buffer_line</em>, which calculates the steps needed for each stepper motor and actually makes these steps happen.</p>

<p>The exact kinematics used in this function are explained in much more detail at the <a href=""https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/wiki/Delta-kinematics"" rel=""nofollow"">Marlin github</a>.</p>

<p>What is important to note is that plan_buffer_line moves the carriages linearly, and the printhead thus describes an arc and not a straight line. A straight line move is thus approximated by many small arcs.</p>
"
"<p>There are two main special steps to the technique used by most open-source 3d printer controllers:</p>

<ol>
<li>Divide each linear gcode segment into lots of very small subsegments (""Segmentation"")</li>
<li>Use some basic trigonometry or the pythagorean theorem to tie extruder position to carriage height for each of the three towers (""Inverse Kinematics"") 
to find the target position for each small segment</li>
</ol>

<p>The inverse kinematics are surprisingly simple. A virtual 90 degree triangle is constructed from two known lengths to solve for the unknown third length: </p>

<ul>
<li>The fixed delta arm length is the hypotenuse of the triangle</li>
<li>The horizontal distance between the column joints and end-effector joints is calculated from the XY coordinates of the nozzle and the fixed position of the column, to determine the length of the lower side of the triangle</li>
<li>The length of the upper side of the triangle is calculated from the previous two via the pythagorean theorem</li>
<li>The length of the upper side is added to the nozzle Z height to get the necessary carriage height</li>
</ul>

<p>I think the best open-source reference here is Steve Grave's Rostock Kinematics document, rev3 available for download here: <a href=""https://groups.google.com/d/msg/deltabot/V6ATBdT43eU/jEORG_l3dTEJ"" rel=""nofollow"">https://groups.google.com/d/msg/deltabot/V6ATBdT43eU/jEORG_l3dTEJ</a>
Some relevant pictures:

<p>These inverse kinematics calculations are performed for each carriage to get a ""carriage space"" target position, and this is performed for every path sub-segment.</p>

<p>The results from these steps can then be reinserted back into the standard linear path interpolation techniques for the printer, in which it fires steps in the necessary ratios and at the necessary rates to produce the desired straight-line motion and acceleration/velocity profile. (How THAT is done is a different question.)</p>

<p>The net effect is that the printer will move through a series of small ""linear"" carriage movements (linear meaning constant* speed with respect to time) that collectively approximate the necessary curved (quadratic position with respect to time) carriage motions required to produce a straight-line end-effector move.</p>

<p>*(<em>Constant speed before acceleration slowdowns are applied in order to obey dynamics constraints, anyway. Again, that's the subject of a different question.)</em></p>

<p>Segmentation is very similar to the process of using a polygon to approximate a circle. If the facets are small enough, the polygon is a good approximation. Higher Segmentation rates produce less path-following error.  The primary conceptual difference between drawing circle arcs and Delta motion paths is that the so-called ""faceted arc"" with Delta Segmentation is constructed in height-vs-time coordinates instead of the X-vs-Y coordinates you'd use to draw a circle on a computer screen. </p>

<p>This system is used in large part because support for Delta style printers was originally bolted onto GRBL-based motion planners which were written exclusively for straight-line motion paths in Cartesian printers. It was a relatively minimal modification to the existing codebase compared to implementing full quadratic path interpolation.</p>

<p>Techniques have evolved over the years. And alternate approaches are often used: for example, the dc42 fork of RepRapFirmware performs exact path-following without segmentation, by recalculating the proper time for the next step <em>after every step</em>. This is functionally equivalent to approximating a circle with a polygon facet count <em>so high that every pixel on the screen gets its own facet</em>. So it is exactly as accurate as the positioning resolution of the motors allows. The downside is that this segmentation-free technique is fairly processor-intensive, so it only works on relatively fast controllers, not the older 8bit Atmega AVR that powers most existing consumer/hobbyist printers today. </p>

<p>Other techniques are possible. The academic parallel robotics control literature is a whole other world of mathematical techniques and complexity in order to produce generalized control algorithms that work for a wide range of robot mechanisms. The version we use in open-source 3d printers is quite simple and application-specific in comparison. </p>

"<p>Different types of hotends and extruders can lead to different problems associated with clogging. Based on my personal experience the leading causes of clogs and jams are the following</p>

<ol>
<li>Foreign material in the nozzle (dirt, dust, low quality filament)</li>
<li>Mixing materials in the hotend (running ABS at 220 then switching to PLA without purging the nozzle)</li>
<li>Excessive retraction or ""heat soak"" in PLA (PLA expands when heated if your retraction is set to high you can actually push the expanded PLA high enough that it cools down and can no longer flow)</li>
</ol>

<p>To solve these issues I recommend using one type of filament, preferably decent quality (typically $40 per kg), if you swap materials be sure to completely purge your nozzle of the higher temperature material. Set your retraction as low as you can trying to minimize ooze (try .4 mm for all metal hotend or 2-3 mm for makerbot style). To minimize carbonized plastic in your hotend don't leave your hotend's heater on for extended periods of time. One way to keep dust from accumulating on your filament is to cover your rolls when you aren't using them, I personally use hairnets, you can buy a 12 pack for a couple of dollars and they last for a long time.</p>

"<p>I had a similar issue on my Printrbot Simple Metal. I believe my problem was initially caused by clogged nozzle which I replaced, however the jamming persisted. I can't say for sure that it was acting exactly as you describe but I think it may have been similar. I noticed that the little red insulating sleeve was pushed up higher than it was when I got it from Printrbot. When I lowered this my problem seemed to go away.</p>

"<p>Is there a definitive scalable 3d printer? </p>

<p>I've seen examples of Chinese companies printing entire houses, and I'm curious as to printers / filaments that are intended (or at least able) be scaled up for (very) large print jobs. </p>

<p>Since most hobby printers can take hundreds of hours for something that can still be held in our hands, so I'm curious if there are any designs for printers that are meant to extrude material efficiently with a easily scalable printing area. </p>

<p>Open sourced / free is preferable; though I'm interested in <strong>any</strong> designs that exist, commercial included. Thanks!</p>

"<p>Our library system just put a 3D printer in one of the branches. I have used SketchUp on the library computers for a number of years just to do artsy things. Suddenly, I have the opportunity to actually print something. (I'm really not sure why the libraries have SketchUp installed. But, I have enjoyed using it.)</p>

<p>There is a plug-in available for SketchUp so that it can export STL files. But, the security on the library computers will not allow me to put a file into the SketchUp plug-ins folder. And, the tech guy at the library doesn't think that the IT guys at the library will update all the copies of SketchUp at all the branches just so someone could do 3D printing.</p>

<p>After doing some searching on this website, I found out that I could export a COLLADA / dae file from SketchUp. I would then import that dae file into Blender (The portable version on my flash drive). I could then export it as an STL file. 
The process appeared to work. I could see my test object in Blender. </p>

<p>I gave the STL file to the branch manager who tried to open it in the Makerbot software so that it could be sent to the printer. But, it gave him a message about the file not being recognized. </p>

<p>I am not familiar with all the details in the importing and exporting processes that are going on. Is there someone out there that can give me some help?</p>

<p>One problem is that, I am using the library computers. I cannot alter them. I can use what portable versions of software are out there, like Blender.</p>

"<p>If I understand your question correctly, it sounds like you're looking somewhere within the <a href=""http://reprap.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">RepRap</a> realm. The RepRap community is mostly responsible for the boom in consumer 3D printing in the past 10 years, and that's most likely because it's <strong>open source</strong>. RepRap designs are mostly dynamic (and most parts can be 3D printed), so you could theoretically build a larger frame for your machine and use a slicing engine that allows you to set the build volume. I believe <a href=""http://slic3r.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">Slic3r</a> allows you to customize the build space, I'm not sure though.</p>

"<p>One big challenge with scaling anything up (or down), is that not all properties or characteristics scale linearly.</p>

<p>Consider a trivial case: a small cube. If you double the size, you've quadrupled the surface area and octupled the weight.</p>

<p>If you take a desktop-sized 3d printer design, and just double the size, it will weigh 8 times as much. But all the bolts holding it together are only 4 times as strong. So weight-bearing bolts are effectively under twice the strain (per unit of cross-sectional area); the exact factor depends of lots of things (orientation, leverage, etc).</p>

<p>If you scale up by 10x, they'll potentially be under 10 times greater stress, and probably snap.</p>

<p>Many, many parts will have similar issues: Drive belts that are twice as wide and twice as thick will still have 1/2 the (relative) strength -- and stiffness for the motors to overcome. </p>

<p>The stepper motors have to move 8 times the weight, <em>and</em> you'll want them to move far, far faster. But steppers lose torque when you spin them faster.</p>

<p>My main printer is pretty much a MendelMax 2, but the Y axis is about 6 times bigger (X and Z are normal). On MM2 the whole build platform moves along Y -- on my printer it weighs far more than on a regular-size MM2 -- it's 6 times the mass just because of size, besides that it has to be much stiffer to avoid sagging over that distance. I went to a larger motor, but it could still barely move the axis. I eventually got it to move at pretty normal speed, but to print long objects it really should be 6 times faster or so.</p>

<p>That would require an amazing motor -- and really big electronics to drive it.</p>

<p>Another challenge is the printing material -- 20mm diameter PLA fiber would be really impressive, but a little hard to find, and a spool would be hard to lift. The power needed to melt it fast enough would be impressive, too. Bridge and house printers I've seen in reports, use pumped concrete through about a 100mm wide nozzle (I have no idea what the nozzle is made of, to stand up to the abrasion). See <a href=""http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2015-09/21/giant-3d-printer-builds-houses"">http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2015-09/21/giant-3d-printer-builds-houses</a> for some cool pictures and video.</p>

<p>Scaling up is a fascinating project -- but it's harder than it looks.</p>

"<p>As far as I know, right now, all the ""3D printers"" that can print houses, bridges, etc. are experimental models (and sometimes, vey elaborate art projects) - they just don't exist except as one-off creations designed as a proof-of-concept showing this can be done.</p>

<p>Maybe some of those project published their plans and code but they are not designed for mass production or general use, even if you manage to build another copy of one of them it will probably be able to print just the same project the original printed. </p>

<p>You specifically asked about speed, material and build area:</p>

<p><strong>Speed:</strong> the speed really depends on the size of the printer's nozzle, the typical desktop printer has a 0.4mm nozzle, if you replace it with a 1mm nozzle the printer will be approximately twice as fast (1.25 nozzle area vs 3.14 nozzle area, assuming you have an hotend designed for larger nozzles that can melt the plastic fast enough).</p>

<p>Now, the ""house printer"" does not use a standard desktop hotend (see material below) and buildings don't have fine details so you can make the head much larger.</p>

<p>However, as far as I know the early prototypes are still much slower then conventional construction methods.</p>

<p><strong>Material:</strong> houses are typically not made of plastic, the printers I know of have welding equipment instead of an hotend and extrude steel</p>

<p>There are probably other methods but I bet all of them use typical construction materials such as steel and not thermoplastic.</p>

<p><strong>Size:</strong> and last but not least, it's obviously not practical to build a printer with as house sized platform, the house printers are actually relatively small robots that travel across the construction project, leaving material behind them and then climb over the previous layer to print the next part.</p>

"<p>A quick blast from a heat gun will very slightly reflow the surface texture and eliminate white marks. </p>

<p>However, it's important to avoid over-heating the perimeter layers or you'll see them soften and sag into the infill. So wait for the heat gun to get fully hot and then use a short duration of high heat. Let the part cool between attempts if you don't get it all the first time, or need to clean up a large area. </p>

"<p>I'm having trouble getting my MendelMax 2's heatbed <em>not</em> to heat up when I want to print without it. I don't get how multiple sources of control relate to each other (same with extrusion temperatures, actually):</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Slic3r (1.2.9) has settings under Filament Settings / Filament / Bed, for First layer and Other layers (and groups of settings can be saved).</p></li>
<li><p>The pronterface GUI (Printrun-Mac-10Mar2014) has an ""Options"" panel where you can set ""Bed temperature"" (actually, two settings, one for PLA and one for ABS -- though I doubt the software can test which filament is loaded!)</p></li>
<li><p>The pronterface GUI also has a menu/fill-in labelled ""Bed"", which works fine to adjust the bed when nothing is printing. The menu there lets you pick from a manually-entered value, ""0 (off)"", and (apparently) the settings for PLA and ABS from the options panel.</p></li>
<li><p>Marlin's Configuration.h has settings for bed minimum and maximum temps (the non-zero minimum seems to be to prevent running the bed when the thermistor isn't working, to avoid unlimited overheating).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I recently tried to print some PLA with no bed heat (using blue tape on the glass build plate). I sliced the model with bed heat off in Slic3r; changed the PLA bed temps in the printerface options panel to 0; and picked the PLA setting in the GUI main screen (and also tried setting ""0 (off)"" manually.</p>

<p>When I started to print the object, the bed turned on and stayed on, maintaining 60C.</p>

<p>I thought of just unplugging the heatbed, but then I expect the print would never start, since it would try to heat up the bed and never succeed.</p>

<p>So how does the decision about which temperature setting to use, <em>really</em> get made? I have the same question about extruder temps, speeds, accelerations, and other things, too -- whose settings are really in charge?</p>

"<p>An 8bit Atmega can provide bare-bones delta performance with Marlin (eg 40mm/s print speed) or pretty good performance with Repetier (due to more optimized algorithms). <strong><em>For a small and simple delta like a bare-bones Mini Kossel, 8bit may be fine. If you want to do high-speed printing or use any of the fancier features, you should go with 32bit.</em></strong></p>

<p>The big issue with 8bit comes up when you want to do something that taxes the MCU. Delta kinematics already add a lot of extra math on top of all the normal printer functions like command parsing, motion planning, and heater control. For example, adding any of these to an 8bit Delta can cause issues:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Bed tilt compensation ""auto-leveling""</strong> -- the coordinate space rotation transform adds a lot of extra floating point calculations to every movement segment. That really taxes the 8bit Atmega since it does not have native floating point support. (Note that pre-print auto-calibration such as in the RichCattell Marlin fork is not the same as bed tilt compensation and does not add any run-time processor load.)</li>
<li><strong>Full graphics LCDs</strong> -- refreshing the LCD screen for animations and status reports takes a surprising amount of horsepower. 8bit Marlin is widely known to suffer from stuttering and print quality issues when running a GLCD on a delta.</li>
<li><strong>Highly faceted (smooth) curves, particularly over USB</strong> -- the high rate of gcode command processing sucks up a lot of clock cycles, particularly in firmwares that run USB comms as a top-priority interrupt. </li>
</ul>

<p>What the Due (or other 32bit board option) does for you is de-bottleneck the MCU so you can push the printer harder or utilize features that add processor load. Here's why they're so much better:</p>

<ul>
<li>In simple clock speed terms, the SAM3X8E in the Due/Duet/Alligator/etc is about 5 times faster than the Atmega 2560, and the LPC1769 in the Smoothieboard/MKS-SBASE/etc is about 7 times faster. But they're actually MUCH higher performance than clock speed alone would suggest, because the 32bit architecture and native floating point support mean far fewer clock cycles are required for complex calculations. </li>
<li>They also have more RAM, meaning the the firmware can manage more features and look farther ahead when motion planning. </li>
<li>They also have more program space, meaning the firmware can, if desired, be compiled as a single full-featured build that covers all possible printers (as RepRapFirmware and Smoothieware do) and thus end-users don't have to edit and compile code in the Arduino IDE to configure the firmware. The Atmega line requires hundreds of conditional compile statements in the firmware to exclude unused features from the binary to get the memory footprint down.</li>
</ul>

<p>All that said, the switch from an 8bit Atmega AVR to a 32bit ARM Cortex-M3 is still just an upgrade from a late-1990s processor to an early-2000s processor. Neither is ""modern"" by any stretch. <em>(For example, the BeagleBone Black used by Redeem and MachineKit utterly blows away the Due in processing power and memory. But those options have steep learning curves at the moment.)</em> The Due can still be bogged down by printing very fast with lots of features enabled. It's a <strong>big</strong> upgrade on an Atmega, but I predict it's going to be replaced by much faster controllers within the next few years. Announcements of upcoming next-gen controller boards are already trickling out. </p>

<p><strong>To summarize, the answer is yes, a Due-type board is a good buy if you want a high-performance printer. It will meet 99%+ of user's needs today.</strong> But it will be replaced in a few years, just like the Atmegas are being replaced now.</p>

<p><strong>As for specific Due shields, I strongly recommend NOT going with RAMPS-FD.</strong> It was cloned for sale by Asian companies before the design was finished, which seemingly caused the original designer to abandon it before working out all the bugs. RAMPS-FDv1 has some nasty design flaws such as heaters turning on while flashing firmware. RAMPS-FDv2 is better, but can experience unreliable and oddball behavior due to unresolved issues in the circuits intended to make it compatible with both 3v3 boards like the Due and 5v boards like the Mega. (For example, the thermistor voltage reference circuit needs modifying to work right, and there appears to be timing issues in the 3v3-5v level shifters.)</p>

<p><strong>RADDS is a good Due shield.</strong> It is a simpler, more reliable, more compact version of RAMPS-FD. It is very popular in Germany and has recently (late 2015) become available for sale in the US. </p>

<p>I also recommend purchasing the Due R3-E instead of the regular Due R3. Anecdotally, the ""E"" version appears to eliminate some firmware bootup issues that can occur when the board is first powered at lower than nominal voltage.</p>

<p>One possible downside to the Due is that Arduino just announced they are no longer manufacturing it. So all new Due boards from here on will be made by 3rd parties. That's not necessarily bad, since it's open source and many other companies will surely continue making them, but there won't be any more made by Arduino. </p>

<p>For single-board options using the same SAM3X8E processor as the Due, the Duet 0.8.5 is becoming quite popular. (It runs RepRapFirmware, which has some great Delta features.) The Alligator runs Repetier. There are several other beta/experimental/development boards in the works too. The community appears to be moving towards the Due and Due-compatible boards over the other various options.</p>

"<p>First off, <strong>you need the right extruder design</strong>. Specifically, the filament path between the drive gear or hob and hot end must be extremely well-constrained. 1.75mm TPE filaments (thermoplastic elastomers) will buckle in an instant if given the chance. That means they will try to squeeze out of any little opening in the filament drive path rather than being forced through the nozzle. </p>

<ul>
<li>Is there a gap >1mm <em>anywhere</em> between your extruder drive gear and hot end? <em>Including the groove in the drive gear itself.</em> If so, either change extruders or print something to fill the gap. Many popular extruders already have Ninjaflex conversion parts uploaded on Thingiverse or Youmagine.</li>
<li>Are you using a 1.75mm bowden drive? You probably shouldn't bother with the softer TPEs like Ninaflex. Harder TPEs like Semiflex may be ok, but it's still difficult. 3mm bowden drives may perform ok. Direct drive extruders are highly recommend. </li>
<li>TPUs (thermoplastic urethanes) in particular can be sticky in the filament feed path between the spool and extruder. Try to minimize corners and turns (even inside PTFE tubes) between the extruder and spool. As a general rule of thumb, don't exceed 180 degrees of cumulative tube curvature in the entire path from the spool to the nozzle. </li>
</ul>

<p>Once your filament feed path is fully enclosed, the filament will be constrained and unable to squeeze out the side or wrap around your drive gear. That's the most important step.</p>

<p>The next problem is simply <strong>loading</strong> the filament. Purging out PLA or ABS with a soft TPE can be challenging because of the force required to purge the old material. Many default loading routines are actually too fast for TPEs and will cause the TPE filament to bunch up rather than purging the previous material. It tends to extrude better when there is nothing else in the way. Some tips:</p>

<ul>
<li>Do some cold-pulls to clear out the hot end as much as possible before loading the TPE. (Nylon is ideal for this. Preheat to nylon temps, run through some nylon, let the extruder cool to ~180C, and then forcefully pull out the nylon. If you can't pull it out, pull hotter. If it leaves nylon behind, pull colder.)</li>
<li>If you have a high-melting plastic like PET or nylon in the hot end, purge with a lower-melting solid filament like PLA first. This will reduce the viscosity of the old material when inserting the TPE. </li>
<li>If your printer has a fixed loading speed, consider making a gcode file with nothing but a preheat and very slow extruder move as a custom loading script. </li>
<li>If you fail to load and jam up the TPE, try again! Sometimes it takes a few load/unload cycles to get the old material purged and a clean feed going. </li>
</ul>

<p>The final issue is <strong>print settings</strong>. You ever hear the saying, ""you can't push a rope""? That's kind of what you're fighting with TPEs. With a properly constrained feed path, you can push rubber, but not very hard. So minimizing extrusion force is the name of the game.</p>

<ul>
<li>Print SLOW to start. Like 10mm/s. You can dial it up once you're getting good results. This will minimize nozzle back-pressure and reduce the amount of ""pushing a rope"" that the extruder drive must do.</li>
<li>Retract as little as possible. Turn off ""optional"" retractions in your slicer, such as during layer changes. Some people even print with no retraction at all, and use high travel speeds and coast/wipe features to minimize stringing. That's overkill, but it can help with marginal extruders. I personally add about 50% to my normal ABS/PLA retraction distance. </li>
<li>Print on the hotter side of the recommended range to start, then dial down the temp as needed to reduce stringing and oozing. Printing hot will reduce nozzle back-pressure.</li>
</ul>

<p>With all that, it should be possible to print the softest TPEs with reasonable success. But if you really can't get it working right, plenty of higher-durometer TPEs are available now that are significantly easier to extrude. </p>

"<p>I have two different printers that can print un-tethered. The first is a Prusa inspired machine with an LCD and the second is a printrbot without an LCD.</p>

<p>The reprap machine uses a ramps 1.4 board programmed with Marlin that gives me the ability to control loading and unloading of the filament with simple menus. </p>

<p>Not all printers that have the ability to print from SD come with an LCD screen. My printrbot simple metal does not come with an LCD, it is an additional $100.</p>

<p>I am too cheap to buy one so I came up with an extremely low tech way of changing filament. I turn my printer on with an SD card that has an auto0.g file (this tells the board to load and run g-code on start-up), once the printer starts to move I kill the power remove the filament and put new filament into the extruder. I then press the lever to disengage the extruder motor and force the new filament into the hot end until the old color has been purged. Please note this method only works when you are replacing materials that have the same printing temperatures.</p>

"<p>By a pretty large margin, the most popular ""primary control via LCD"" printers such as the FlashForge Creator line and Makerbot Replicator 1/2/2x run Sailfish firmware, which has options for all necessary control functions directly from the LCD. Preheat, load, unload, level bed, etc are all done via the LCD and seamlessly built-in scripts. There is no need to connect host software to do anything but update firmware and change rarely-adjusted settings like acceleration parameters. RepRap-style USB control of Sailfish printers is perfectly functional, but not really necessary 99.9% of the time. </p>

<p>This is a major reason why Sailfish printers have historically been popular for printer farms. They're designed for stand-alone operation, which is highly favorable when the printers greatly outnumber the associated computers. It's extremely rare to see a Sailfish printer from the last 5 years without a 5-button LCD panel. </p>

<p>The Sailfish firmware UI/UX is simply built around the LCD buttons rather than host software. This is <em>generally</em> more reliable and higher-performance than, say, Marlin via host because it reduces processor time spent on command transmission and eliminates all the possible failure modes in the PC and USB link. </p>

<p>Assuming all Sailfish printers will have LCDs with SD card support and focusing on that one interface really allowed the creation of an overall better printer. More optimization, fewer things that need to be configured by the end-user. But in exchange, you're limited in what kind of hardware Sailfish will support. It's a tradeoff.</p>

<p>In comparison, LCD support was more strapped onto RepRaps as an option rather than the core interface element. This tends to produce a host-driven interface design, rather than an LCD-driven interface design. Which is why operating ""headless"" tends to be more difficult in Marlin, Repetier, etc. </p>

"<p>I know that my RoBo 3D has the ability to run untethered once the gcode file is saved to the SD card attached to the ramps board. It does have to be attached to the computer to start the print at first, but can then be unplugged from your computer. Since it is just a Marlin based Ramps printer this should work for similar 3D printers.</p>

<p>The gcode files contain the temperature of both the nozzle and the heated bed if you have one. The Marlin firmware will prime the temperatures for you.</p>

<p>Changing filament you would still need to set your hot end temp to swap in the new filament with a computer over USB though.</p>

<p>Now I personally use something called OctoPi which is a raspberry pi distribution preconfigured with Octoprint. OctoPrint allows you to control the printer, monitor or start prints over a web interface and even stream video to watch your prints if you want. While technically you printer is still tied to a computer(raspberry pi), it does not tie up the use of your laptop/desktop while printing. Plus this would allow you to put your 3D printer in more locations in your home as well.</p>

"<p>Make sure your printer is properly calibrated and that there are no jams as this can cause blobs or other defects on the object. Printing at a higher resolution would also make the object smoother, as there would also be less difference between each layer.</p>

<p>The filament that you are using could be a cause for the rough look as well. Make sure you play around with the temperature to find the right range for a specific brand of filament. I have noticed different brands tend to print better at different temperatures, and if it too low could cause flow issues.</p>

<p>Also leaving PLA out in the air tends to have it absorb moisture which is also no good. If you are not going to use it for a while put the filament back in a resealable bag with a desiccant to help keep moisture out.</p>

<p>If you don't want to see the printed layers you could also try melting the surface again with a heat gun to smooth out the object. <em>Be careful not to overheat the object</em>, because could you could discoloring or cause drooping.</p>

<li>you let the filament run out mid print, most extruders have a ""dead zone"" between the grinding wheel and the hot end, in which if the filaments stays stuck there, your only option is to open the extruder</li>
<li>you let a filament create knots with no one present to readily fix the knots, or the grinding wheel will saw the filament, leading to (1) plus a clogged grinding wheel: more often than not the quality of a filament brand is measured by the presence or absence of knots.</li>
<li>you let the hot head stay hot without printing for too long, it will fill of melted filament leading to risk of it carbonizing inside the extruder, leading one again to (1)</li>
<li>you use flex or rubber material which have the added complexity of grinding against the common plastic guides of the filaments feeders: depending on the material used, you might decide to avoid using the guides and feeding the extruder directly</li>
<li>you print at higher qualities (e.g. 0.1 mm) leads to lower filament throughput that can become stuck if the nozzle is too wide (and the grinding wheel goes too fast)</li>
<li>you never clean (i.e. blowing will suffice) the grinding wheel: filament dust sticks there increasingly over time.</li>
<li>you let the extruder is too close to the plate: if the filament is not free to fall on plate as it should (settings-wise) it will fill the hot end back up leading to clogs</li>
<li>you print wood, brick and derivate filaments: they are highly unhealthy for the extruder since they are plastic/resin charged with wood powder. The powder tends to a) burn and b) stick to the internal walls of the extruder.</li>

"<p>You don't need a specific menu for this (although some printers are more able than others to do the following procedure), just play with the filament loading procedure.</p>

<p>Although better print qualities are given by sticking (if possible) to the same color and filament, when you have to ""flush out"" any trace:</p>

<ul>
<li>get an <strong>ABS</strong> filament of the <strong>most neutral color</strong> possible, getting a spool dedicated to this task might be a good idea</li>
<li>load the neutral ABS at 250 degrees (or higher) and let it extrude <strong>freely</strong> and <strong>quickly</strong> for <strong>at least</strong> 1 meter.</li>
<li>if you need to clean more, extrude at least 3 meters</li>
</ul>

<p>Note:</p>

<ul>
<li>if you can't get ABS (the best option) you can use PLA, but results may vary...</li>
<li>if you can't get neutral color (absence or almost no color pigment), white is the best choice, otherwise black. Neutral color is best by far for obvious reasons.</li>
</ul>

"<p>As suggested by Ryan Carlyle you will need to use heat to reflow the plastic. However I recommend against using a heat gun as generally you want a very concentrated small area to be heated.</p>

<p>I have had great success in using a soldering iron with the tip placed close to (but obviously not touching) the problem area. Keeping within about 3-5mm has very good results, is easier to control and position. This limits the impact to the surrounding areas and can let you get into small crevices etc.</p>

<p>Just be careful not to touch the part.</p>

"<p>We have a Makerbot Replicator 2X at our school.  I have a class in the computer lab and one of our focuses is using the printer. Currently, it is not printing properly.  We are using PLA at 210 degrees Celcius.  The built plate is not heated (using Build Tak).  This has worked very well in the past.  The problem is that when the extruder goes to lay down plastic, the filament is too hot and curls up in a clump around the extruder.  This is characteristic of when we first tried PLA at a higher temperature.  I think that our heat sensor is not working properly.  Does anyone know how we can fix this problem?  Is there a way to calibrate the sensor is should we install a new one?</p>
"
"<p>The temperature is fine.</p>

<p>In my experience the filament curls up only when the extruder is extruding way up, far from the plate: are you experiencing this while actually printing?</p>

<p>If yes: recalibrate the printer so that the extruder is closer to the build plate and this shouldn't happen. For the filament to curl up it means you are way higher than you should be.</p>

"<p><br>
I'm building  my own 3d printer (custom design, made by me and cut using a water cutting machine) but I always had problem with extruder clogging.<br>
I had 4 extruders, a J-Head, a full metal, a full metal made by me and my current extruder which is just a block of alluminium with a plaster cold-end 100% homemade with no precision at all ehehe<br>
Beleive me or not, this one is the only one that has finished a whole print (about 40 minutes), all the others, with or without fans, haven't managed to finish one!<br>Well... this extruder has a 1.5mm hole so I guess that that's why it can print<br>
The problem with all the other was that the 1.75mm PLA that I'm using clogged the extruder after 2 minutes.<br>
Now I would like to buy a new, more precise, extruder, I'm in a bowden system, can you please suggest me a good one?
<br>Thanks for your time, if you're interested i can post some pictures of the printer!<br>Matteo</p>

<p><br><br>Update, that's my printer <a href=""http://s10.postimg.org/mhk71hq0p/IMG_20160302_204645713.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://s10.postimg.org/mhk71hq0p/IMG_20160302_204645713.jpg</a>

"<p>You just need some wires, nothing special about them. You can use any wire that's flexible enough. For the endstop you'll need 2 wires, for the servo (if you need to extend the cable) 3. The connectors on the end are known as dupont connectors.</p>
"
"<p>Overall, it is unlikely that the problem is temp sensing accuracy. There are only a few things that will throw off the thermocouple's reading:</p>

<ul>
<li>Poor thermal coupling between the tip and the hot block, such as if the tip has partially pulled free of the brass thermowell crimp (this will make the hot block hotter than the reported temp)</li>
<li>Loss of electrical insulation between the tip and the hot block, plus some ground loop noise or stray voltage on the hot block (this will typically add noise to the reported temp)</li>
</ul>

<p>You should be able to visually check for the first, and test for the second with a multimeter. The resistance between the board end of the thermocouple leads and the brass thermowell at the tip should be infinite / out of range. </p>

<p>To actually check the thermocouple calibration, you have a few options:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Easy:</strong> Look at the behavior of the printed plastic. PLA that is too hot will smell of pancakes/waffles much stronger than normal, or even smell burnt. The printed material may be more shiny than usual. It will string and ooze more as you print.</li>
<li><strong>Moderate:</strong> Secure another reference thermocouple (such as might come with a digital multimeter) tightly to the hot block with some Kapton tape, somewhere the aluminum block is exposed. The external TC should read within a few degrees of the printer's TC. (Assuming you get it attached well enough.)</li>
<li><strong>Hard:</strong> Place the tip of the TC in boiling water to check if it reads 100C (or slightly lower if you live at a high altitude). Repeat with well-mixed ice water to check if it reads 0C. Both measurements should be within a couple degrees. You will probably need to dismantle much of the extruder to detach the thermocouple for this test.  </li>
</ul>

<p>But, again, the problem probably isn't the TC. It's more likely either a bed tramming issue (eg too much gap between nozzle and surface) or the BuildTak is degraded and not adhering. This can happen if you do a large number of prints in the exact same place, or get the surface oily, such as with fingerprints. Try a fresh sheet of buildtak or cleaning it with rubbing alcohol and moving the print to a different location. </p>

<p>In some rare cases, low-quality filament or filament stored in very high humidity may not stick well. This is pretty rare though. For the most part, if your nozzle gap is right, any extruded plastic will stick to Buildtak. </p>

"<p>I've been searching, but I'm coming up empty-handed. They have a file for the TAZ with the 0.35mm nozzle, but I'm not certain if I can just change the nozzle size and be done with it.</p>

"<p>Have you tried the configuration assistant under the ""Help"" menu?</p>

From S3D 3.0.2</p>

<p>And yes, you can just change the nozzle size in the process ""Extruder"" tab and be done with it, if you're using auto extrusion width. If you're using manual extrusion width, also change that to be equal or greater than the nozzle size. </p>

<p>S3D will handle everything else. It's not a bad idea to recalibrate extrusion multiplier (with 100% infill 20x20 calibration boxes) but it isn't strictly necessary. </p>

<p>General tip for switching to a larger nozzle: while you get used to it, make sure you preview your sliced files carefully looking for areas with gaps or missing details smaller than the extrusion width. </p>

"<p>I can not find anywhere default steps per unit for Makerbot replicaor 2. I'm using Ramp V1.4 instead original board and need to know default steps :/</p>
"
"<p>The Replicator 2 and 2x use 18 tooth GT2 pulleys, 1/16 microstepping, and 200 steps/rev steppers. That makes the proper steps/mm value 88.888889. </p>

<p>Note that Makerbot used ~88.56 steps/mm in their defaults, which is the value you get if you calculate from the belt+pulley pitch diameter from the Gates GT2 specs. But this is the value you use for calculating belt length required in a closed loop, not for steps/mm. The 88.88... number is more accurate. </p>
"
"<p>I found a solution to my problem, which is very similar to your!</p>

<p>Ok, so first, this clog has nothing to do with the flow rate! speed, retraction, or acceleration!</p>

<p>why? because if it under extrusion or over extrusion, the nozzle would spill more or less filament, but it would not make the extruder clog. To make it clog, there must be something that block the path which make the step driver couldn't push the filament through right? even using your hand.</p>

<p>This problem is call ""heat creep"", especially if you print small detail things. This is because small details make the filament stay inside the nozzle longer, which the heat eventually make the filament swole up and block the path. </p>

<p>To find out if your problem is cause by ""heat creep"" or not, try to print something small but tall and print something large overall. If it is heat creep, then the small but tall print would immediately clog your nozzle and make the step driver create click sound. If both print ( small and big ) take the same amount of time to clog your nozzle, then it may not cause by ""heat creep"".</p>

<p>SO HERE the solution for ""heat creep."" First and the most important, replace your thermal barrier tube. Second, lower the temperature. Third, check the filament guide components such as the drive gear, bearing, and spring. For example, check the drive gear if it securely screw into the stepper motor. Lastly, check the fan, if it possible, install another fan to cool down the thermal barrier tube. In conclusion, replace your thermal barrier before doing anything else.</p>

<p>I hope this help for you and for many other people! </p>

"<p>I have seen some lasers attached to the RepRap platform for cutting but most seem to be cutting paper, balsa wood, or merely etching.  If I were wanting to build a platform for cutting wood, similar to the wood framed or boxed 3D printers on the market, what power laser would I need for that?  I assume that a lower powered laser would have to travel slower but going too slow would add the possibility of catching the wood on fire (not good).  </p>
"
"<p>Please do not go down this road. First, not all lasers are equally absorbed by the material and the energy converted to heat to vaporize the material. The light not absorbed is reflected right back into your eyes. This is especially dangerous because it doesn't make you go blind instantly, fooling you into thinking there is no harm. You got the other part right, the lower the laser power, the less turned to heat, the longer it takes to cut, the longer you risk exposure to your eyes. That's right, a low powered laser is MORE dangerous than a big one. Next, the only way to properly cut is with air assist. This means a stream of air blows away the vaporized material so the laser can keep cutting deeper. This also prevents fires. The thing we haven't even touched is a proper safety enclosure, proper bed design to not reflect the laser beam back into the laser killing it and your eyes, and finally smoke/particle exhaust. </p>

<p>Simply put, these cheapo DIY lasers are dangerous, and are also illegal.</p>
"
"<p>Strapping a laser to a cheap robot made with flammable plastic parts and no enclosure is stupid in the extreme. Don't do it. Seriously, just don't. <strong>RepRaps are not suitable for laser conversions.</strong> </p>

<p>You have to worry about reflected light damaging your eyes, and for the blue diode lasers currently growing in popularity, causing skin melanomas. You have to worry about mechanical vibration from jerky motion loosening fasteners. You have to worry about the workpiece catching on fire. You have to worry about the fumes being generated from etching and cutting. You have to worry about firmware freezes locking the laser on. It's dangerous to you, anybody in line of sight of the machine, and your property. </p>

<p>Many of the lasers currently being sold for RepRap conversions, particularly from Russia, violate US and EU safety regulations related to power and safety interlocks and should not be on the market at all. </p>

<p>The people posting videos of their RepRap laser conversions are almost always ignorant of proper laser safety requirements and regulations. It's downright scary how much blue flare you can see the camera picking up in a lot of these videos. Don't follow in those people's footsteps. </p>

<p>More directly answering the question details, most people doing light etching or paper cutting type work are using small 0.5-2W diode lasers. These are particularly dangerous because they have poor focus and because they don't have the power to cut cleanly and quickly. That means more fumes, more fire risk, and more damage to the workpiece from edge charring. </p>

<p>Slowing down the laser is not a good solution: dwell time is your enemy. You want a beam powerful enough to near-instantly vaporize the material, not slowly burn it away. </p>

<p>An entry-level proper lasercutter for cutting things like plywood and acrylic is more likely to use a 40w CO2 laser. It should have air assist and fume extraction, and a safety-interlocked enclosure that 100% reflects or absorbs the CO2 laser light wavelength. That basically means a dedicated machine.</p>

"<p>Using an FDM printer and PLA or ABS, without adding support material. What modifications can I make to improve how steep an overhang my printer can print before it starts having problems?</p>

<p>The obvious first answer is to add a cooling fan, increasing the airflow over the freshly-extruded material ensuring it solidifies. What other things can improve it?</p>

<p>Does lowing the temperature help? Raising it?</p>

<p>Does speeding up or slowing down the print head help?</p>

<p>Does increasing/decreasing the extrusion diameter, or layer height help?</p>
"
"<p>There's an answer <a href=""http://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/519/how-to-improve-face-that-are-printed-on-support?answertab=oldest#tab-top"">here</a> that holds some of the same concepts. Regarding your questions: </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Does lowering the temperature help? Raising it?</strong> : Yes, lowering the temperature can help. I've found that it is best to stay closer to the lower end of the material's melting point and just a bit above the point. Not only does this help with potential over extrusion, but also shortens the time it takes for the material to cool (refer to the link above). <em>However</em>, this could cause clogging if your temperature is too low. Keep an eye on your drive gear to see if there is too much friction while at lower temperatures. Increasing may keep the drive gear from ""eating"" your filament.</li>
<li><strong>Does speeding up or slowing down the print head help?</strong> : I prefer to print slower, most of the time, to allow the material to cool a bit more to avoid curling/warping (I primarily print with ABS, so it matters more). You might be able to give and take between temperature and speed. Consider if your nozzle is cooler and your speed is up, bridging gaps might yield the same results as if you proportionately swap these two values. This concept may only matter if you are in a pinch to get the part done. Again, I prefer slowing my machine down as it allows current/previous layers to cool more before continuing. This can be especially helpful with overhangs when paired with lowering your nozzle temperature.</li>
<li><strong>Does increasing/decreasing the extrusion diameter, or layer height help</strong> - I assume that extrusion diameter equals layer height (not difference in nozzle diameter, aka swapping nozzles). I'm not completely sure, but I think this depends on the part as well as slicing engine settings. For me, MakerWare is pretty good about proportionately adjusting extrusion steps with layer height, so I see an equal change in the width of the extrusion. I would think that in general, a larger layer height would yield a larger extrusion width. This would be helpful when printing overhangs, but may not be helpful when printing bridges (a larger strand will retain heat longer than a smaller one).</li>
</ul>

<p>Hopefully this helps, please comment if you need more information/clarification.</p>
"
"<p>The two most important things you can do are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Provide adequate cooling to solidify the plastic quickly</li>
<li>Minimize layer height</li>
</ul>

<p>Cooling is really obvious. You need the plastic to solidify before it has a chance to sag. PLA in particular has to shed a lot of heat before it is fully solid. A fan and air guide setup using a ""squirrel-cage"" radial blower around the nozzle is optimal. A little 30mm or 40mm axial fan will not provide optimal performance. </p>

<p>Low layer height when slicing is less obvious, but is extremely effective. When you use thinner layers, two things happen:</p>

<ul>
<li>There is less melted plastic per pass and a higher surface area to volume ratio, so the fresh material cools faster. </li>
<li>A larger percentage of each strand in the overhang is supported by the previous strand. If you do 0.2mm thick by 0.4mm wide, half of each strand is unsupported. But if you do 0.1mm thick by 0.4mm wide, only a quarter of each strand is unsupported. </li>
</ul>

<p>When you combine these two effects, it is possible to exceed 70 degree overhangs with good surface quality. </p>

<p>Another lesser factor is printing shells/perimeters inside-out rather than outside-in. This helps anchor the outermost strand a little better as the overhang is built. This is pretty minor though. </p>
"
"<p>Typical procedure on the casting is to use the lost-wax method, and using PLA is absolutely fine.</p>

<ul>
<li>Print your part at around 101% - 103% size</li>
<li>Attach flues to the part (or have them part of the model)</li>
<li>Cast the part in a mixture of sand and plaster of paris</li>
<li>Once set, burn out the PLA in a furnace.</li>
<li>Clean the mould of debris</li>
<li>Pour your metal of choice</li>
</ul>

<p>I believe that a good solution would be to gather the owners of 3D printers, 3D modelers and the final buyer. I've heard about similar solutions for that, but it's mailing occur between the owners and the final buyers, and the 3D model should be get from a free online distribution or outsourced.

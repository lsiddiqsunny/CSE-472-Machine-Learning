"<p>I just got a pound of microroasted, local coffee and am curious what the optimal way to store it is (what temperature, humidity, etc)</p>
"
"<p>I manually grind coffee beans for drip coffee but I thought that depending on whether the coffee is intended to be used for a cafetiere or espresso machine then the fineness needs to be varied.</p>

<p>So what is the optimum fineness for drip coffee?</p>

<p>Does it matter so much given that I am not using pressure (typically 15 bar in an espresso machine) to force hot water through the coffee grounds.</p>
"
"<p>I live in a hard water area and when brewing English Tea I can <em>definitely</em> taste and see the difference when compared to where I'm from, which is a soft water area.</p>

<p><strong>Does the hardness of the water matter when making coffee, too?</strong></p>

<p>For instance, whether or not the taste is more or less intense depending on the hardness of the water. I haven't noticed but I would think it does affect the flavor.</p>

<p>I'd be interested in a <strong>scientific/objective view</strong>. As of now, I use bottled water in my kettle.</p>
"
"<p>I own a drip coffee pot:
<img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/H0sqP.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>and one of the other things you can buy is a <a href=""http://www.hario.jp/product/list.php?middelclass=3"">thin spouted kettle</a> which is used for pouring water one to the grounds.</p>

<p>What is the theory behind this?</p>

<p>Does the rate of water delivery/flow just agitate the suspension of coffee/water in a way that is better?</p>

<p>I also see such items being used in coffee shops too so would really like an expert's summation on this.</p>
"
"<p>I observe that coffee servers (I refuse to use the term barista) will apply pressure to the coffee grounds using a variety of methods and pressure. This seems to vary wildly and I'd like to know how important is this? Is there some general rule of thumb when it comes to recommended pressure?</p>

<p>My thoughts were that the fineness mattered the most for espresso machines and that reasonable enough pressure when tamping is enough but what do expert's use and believe.</p>
"
"<p>The rule of thumb is that you first drink coffee approximately 3 days after it is roasted, but what is the exact reason for this?</p>
"
"<p>Tamping is one of three key controls you have over the espresso brewing process; The others are dose (the amount of coffee used) and grind coarseness.  Together, they allow the coffee machine operator to produce a puck of the correct density and consistency through which the pressurized water can be pushed through.</p>

<p>While techniques vary, the ""rule of thumb"" is to apply roughly thirty pounds of force evenly across the puck; however, the key is consistency.  Keep your variables the consistent and you'll be able to dial in the best end-product.</p>

<p>I've been able to pull great shots using anything from just the weight of the tamper itself to my full weight pushed onto a puck, keeping all of the other factors where they needed to be to create the correct puck density.</p>

<p>See this video below for more detail:
<a href=""http://community.wholelattelove.com/videos/1854/quick-tip-what-is-the-right-way-to-tamp"">http://community.wholelattelove.com/videos/1854/quick-tip-what-is-the-right-way-to-tamp</a></p>
"
"<p>Let's start off with what the function of the tamp is.</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/xt7gz.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<h2>Function</h2>

<p>The tamp is cylindrical in shape and is ideally just snug enough to fit into the portafilter smoothly. What the tamp does, is prime the coffee bed to be met with water. What we know about the water is that in general, in commercial machines, water is applied with 9 bars of pressure. Physics tells us that pressured water flow will take the path of least resistance. By this logic, the tamp functions by making the coffee bed smooth, even, and robust enough to be hit with 9 bars of pressure and extract evenly. </p>

<h2>Barista Health</h2>

<p><em>Note: In no way am I a qualified physician. This is not to be considered medical advice.</em></p>

<p>If the surface one tamps on is on the proper level, the barista should be able to tamp with their elbo at a 90 degree(ish) angle, and their wrists in a semi-straight path to prevent damage. The barista can then use their body weight, and not muscle, to perform the tamp. By leaning into the tamp with the correct path, one can achieve about 30lbs of pressure. </p>

<h2>Experiments with varying pressure</h2>

<p>Personally I have experimented with varying pressured tamps and have found that applying a greater pressure than 30 lbs produced little effect, at most, a longer extraction. There are other variables that should be adjusted instead, such as the grind size, to achieve such an effect.</p>
"
"<p>For a given coffee and roasting method, what factors of the espresso making process affect the crema and in what way(s) do they affect it? By my own empirical evidence, I would guess that time since grinding, coarseness of the grind, and tamping pressure are the biggest factors.</p>
"
"<p>I notice that some barista's keep whacking the doser on the coffee grinder when they fill the espresso holder. What's the theory behind this?</p>

<p>I would've thought that the fact that the coffee is being ground and falling into the holder that it is being aerated enough already so why do this?</p>

<p>This may be something to do with specific grinder models, it may be just the lever to release coffee, I don't know but would like to hear from someone who knows better than me.</p>
"
"<p>Fresh off the roast, coffee has high levels of carbon dioxide and nitrogen (based?) gasses. These gasses will greatly contribute to <em>retro-nasal activity</em> as well as initial flavors (think carbonated water). The most apparent flavor one gets from this is <em>metallic</em>. At my work, 4 days is considered minimum for serving and tasting, although there's always exceptions. </p>
"
"<p>I came across <a href=""http://coffee.stackexchange.com/q/1/19"">this question</a>, which seeks the optimal method for storing whole beans. In that same vein, I'd like to know the best way to store ground coffee to preserve freshness. Should ambient temperature and humidity be considered?</p>
"
"<p>I ground some coffee beans this morning, but I'm not a major coffee drinker, how fast can I expect its flavour to degrade, and at what point would it become completely undrinkable?</p>
"
"<p>I've heard of adding salt to coffee to reduce its bitterness.
I've also heard that using freshly roasted and ground coffee would reduce the bitterness experienced when drinking coffee. Though it seems making freshly roasted coffee could actually make things worse, according to <a href=""http://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/6/why-is-it-not-recommended-to-drink-coffee-immediately-after-its-roasted"">this question</a>. </p>

<p>Is there a documented process (not additive) to reduce the bitterness of coffee and any research in why that's the case?</p>
"
"<p><strong>Yes.</strong></p>

<p>That is to say it will definitely affect flavor, but how it affects the flavor is ultimately dependent upon the specific mineral compounds found in your hard water vs. other hard waters and soft water's lack of these compounds. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Here's the key: Some of the compounds in hard water are ""sticky,"" glomming onto certain compounds in coffee when they meet (in your coffeemaker). The more eugenol the water hangs on to, for example, the woodsier the taste of your coffee will be. </p>
  
  <p>Magnesium is particularly sticky, meaning water that's high in magnesium will make coffee with a stronger flavor (and higher levels of caffeine). Hard water can also have high levels of bicarbonate, though, which Hendon found could lead to more bitter flavors coming through.  - A Chemist Has Uncovered A Secret To Brewing Delicious Coffee At Home <a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/a-chemist-has-uncovered-a-secret-to-delicious-coffee-2014-6#ixzz3Q3ecJSgz""><em>Business Insider</em></a>. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So depending on flavor preferences you might prefer your hard water at home but dislike it at work or simply prefer soft water altogether. Traditionally hard water is actually sought after for other beverage processes like beer brewing because of some of the abilities described above. </p>
"
"<p>Many methods of brewing coffee differ in the temperature of the water among other factors. Some people swear by cold-brewing, others do slow pour overs with piping hot water.</p>

<p>How exactly is coffee flavor changed by cold, warm, and hot water?</p>
"
"<p>From <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espresso#crema"" rel=""nofollow"">Wikipedia</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The ""crema"" is produced by emulsifying the oils in the ground coffee into a colloid, which does not occur in other brewing methods. 
  <img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/UK772.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Using the right material from the start</h2>

<p>Personally, I think this definition could use some updating. Crema exists because of the freshness of the coffee, in relation to it's roast. It contains the gasses we find from roasting, such as carbon dioxide and nitrogen gasses. You will notice that if you dig up coffee that is months old and brew it as espresso, there will be little crema. Bottoml ine, if you want crema, you need fresh coffee.</p>

<h2>Extraction</h2>

<p>The other factor in producing crema, is correct extraction. If you have a poorly extracted shot of espresso, it will be primarily water, with some seriously over-extracted coffee. An even extraction will produce the highest yield of crema.</p>
"
"<p>In general, it's best to <em>not</em> store ground coffee. If quality really matters, then the real answer is to back up. Try to grind only enough coffee for what you're using immediately to brew with. If you're buying preground coffee, then storage and optimal quality become somewhat trivial.</p>

<p>Once the surface area of the coffee is increased (by grinding it), the majority of the coffee is exposed to air, accelerates the decomposition of the coffee, meaning it likely isn't going to stay fresh for long anyway. Think of it like opening a dry, red wine. Since it's been opened, it's going to turn faster than it being left in the bottle because it's been exposed to atmosphere.</p>

<p>So in short, if flavor and freshness really matter, try not to <em>store</em> ground coffee if at all possible.  </p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>If you really <strong>must</strong> store ground coffee, keep it sealed airtight. The exposure to atmosphere is going to be the strongest catalyst in making your coffee less than fresh.</p>
"
"<p><strong>Coffee should never be stored in the fridge!</strong></p>

<p>In the same way that <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_bicarbonate#Applications"">baking soda</a> absorbs smells, coffee will absorb smells and flavors in your refrigerator. These compounds can be extracted when you brew your coffee and will contribute to undesired flavors.</p>

<p>Proper storage of coffee is to put your beans into an airtight container, and store around 25C out of sunlight (EX: your cabinet). </p>
"
"<p>In general, the coarseness of fine sand. It will be difficult to effectively communicate grind size here, and what is recommended is to go to your local coffee shop, have them grind a sample of coffee for you on their drip grind, and then have you take that home and calibrating your grinder to a similar size, adjusting for taste.</p>
"
"<p>Word on the street is that:</p>

<ol>
<li>The milk residue will get ""baked on"" by the heat of the steam wand, making it even more difficult to clean than if you'd just done it when the milk was still wet.</li>
<li>Any milk left on the tip of the wand will get sucked up into the machine's water reservoirs by changes in air pressure, where it will stay and become rancid and ruin everybody's drinks.</li>
</ol>

<p>This is according to Joel's biweekly beratings on the topic. We might ask him to cite his sources.</p>

"<p>Am I at risk of damaging my Keurig machine if I place an ordinary black tea bag inside instead of a K-Cup?</p>
"
"<p><strong>Lets answer this question with some data!</strong> My company uses machine learning, data science, and sensory science to build flavor profiling and quality control tools for the craft beverage industry. </p>

<p>I will use a lot of graphs, because a picture is worth a thousand words but a graph can communicate a concept, to dispel a lot of the myths about acidity in coffee. </p>

<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: Roast level is the Primary determinant of sour and acidity in coffee, where lighter roast has more natural acid compounds left unbroken from maillard reaction and strecker degradation (non-enzymatic browning).  This is closely followed by Altitude, green processing, and finally age of the coffee.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Differences by Region</h2>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/5FChz.png"" alt=""Sour &amp; Acidity in coffee by Country""></p>

<p>Based on 10,000+ reviews, their seems to be little indication that you can determine the sourness or acidity of a coffee simply by where its grown! </p>

<p>Now, this lack of effect would disappear if we controlled for the altitude the coffee was grown at. Why? Because higher altitude plants are under more stress, forcing them to be more efficient - less leafs, less fruit, but each leaf has a higher respiratory rate, and each fruit is more potent! </p>

<hr>

<h2>Green Processing</h2>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/UE9Xa.png"" alt=""Distribution of Sour and Acidity by Green Processing""></p>

<p>This graph shows the difference in distribution of Sour &amp; Acidity of washed coffee vs natural processed coffee. There is a very small difference in the skew and kurtosis, but it is statistically significant. </p>

<p>Washed Coffee brewed in a Chemex is on average more acidic than its natural washed counterpart. Why? This is most likely a cognitive, not chemical, effect. Because natural processed coffees ferment with bits of remnant fruit (the coffee cherry) they retain more sugars, some of which are preserved though the roasting process. The increase in fruity esters and sugar compounds masks the acidity - so even though there's about equal amounts, you taste it less in the natural processed coffees. </p>

<hr>

<h2>Age of the Coffee</h2>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/Gn6eJ.png"" alt=""Acid Degradation over Time""></p>

<p>If you really want to avoid any acidity in coffee, you could drink it stale! But I don't suggest it - stale coffee lacks the caffeine and interesting flavors that make coffee wonderful. </p>

<p>This plot shows the rate of acid degradation in coffee from its first day since roast. The red line marks the 14th day from roast, when the average coffee goes stale. </p>

<hr>

<h2>Level of Roast</h2>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/uajzo.png"" alt=""Acidity VS Level of Roast""></p>

<p>This graph shows Sour and Acidity as a function of the level of roast; as roast increases, the average perception of acidity decreases (in coffee brewed in a chemex). The grey field shows the Standard Error within the fit. </p>

<p>You should note, why is the error so high at the highest level of roast? These are coffees considered ""French"" or ""Italian"" or even ""Spanish"" roasts - you should consider these coffees burnt. The fruity and interesting acids such as malic, phosphoric, and citric have been destroyed by prolonged heat exposure in the roaster, <strike>and these coffees contain acrylamide, a carcinogen, which is not only bad for you, but also tastes terrible.</strike> </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The levels of acrylamide, a known carcinogen, peak early in the
  roasting process (at about 120 sec).  While acrylamide is still
  detectable in fully roasted and burnt coffees, it most likely don’t
  contribute to the unpleasant, burnt flavor in over-roasted coffee. 
  Multiple studies suggest that the main chemicals that cause bad
  flavors in burnt coffee are heterocyclic aromatic amines and
  polyaromatic hydrocarbons.  These increase with roasting temperature
  and time and many compounds that fall into these categories are known
  or suspected carcinogens.</p>
</blockquote>

<h1>Differences by Brewing Method</h1>

<p>An extension to this question, reviewing the differences in the level of acidity by brewing method has been answered here: <a href=""http://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/349/could-preparation-method-make-coffee-more-acidic/"">Could preparation method make coffee more acidic?</a></p>
"
"<p>The Short answer  to this is no. You should not use a glass jar for storing coffee. </p>

<p><strong>Why?</strong> The base of the answer can be found here: <a href=""https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/123/when-does-coffee-go-off/166#166"">When Does Coffee Go Off?</a></p>

<p>Coffee goes stale relatively quickly, and the transfer to a glass jar will: </p>

<ol>
<li>Increase the coffee's interaction and exposure to oxygen </li>
<li>Increase the coffee's exposure to light, which will cause rancidification of the oils</li>
</ol>

<p>Furthermore, you should only be purchasing and storing whole bean coffee - as pre-ground coffee is already stale. </p>

"<p>I'm aware that coffee grounds can be great for composting, but living in a large city makes that more difficult than I'd prefer. </p>

<p>With every cup of coffee comes a bunch of soggy grounds that I normally throw away shortly after. Are there any constructive uses for spent grounds, be it culinary, cleaning, or scent related?</p>
"
"<p>I've been home-roasting coffee for over a year now, starting with stovetop pan roasting, then moving up to an air popper, and then a small roaster this Christmas. I'm at the point where I can tell a light-roasted, acidic Ethiopian from a dark Indonesian blend, but beyond that I'm frustrated by my inability to pick out specific flavors from one coffee to the next. </p>

<p>Anyone have any tips/tricks for developing this? Or some qualities that vary across coffees that are easier to taste for along with vocabulary to describe what I'm tasting? </p>

"<p>They are very good as de-odourizers, we use them in the kitchen and sometimes in a small perforated plastic container in the footwell of the backseats in our car.</p>

"<p>I have been home roasting with a Gene Cafe since early this last summer.  I chose the Gene Cafe specifically because it appeared to be designed for attachment to a permanent vent solution.  However, I've since found that the three inch exhaust is a very rough fit and that the chaff collector leaks smoke as well.  The vent hole I have installed in my house is also less than optimal since it tends to leak cold air in quite a bit even with two stops installed.  Does anyone have a setup in place that has very little (or better yet, no) smoke leakage when roasting?  What are the elements you have involved to create your smoke free roasting apparatus?</p>
"
"<p>Roaches love coffee. For someone living in a city a roach trap seems like a good solution (but I wouldn't recommend it from personal experience). I wouldn't use coffee grounds as fertilizer in house plants either for the same reason (see below).</p>

<p>I live in NYC and roaches are a problem. The last thing you want is for roaches to tell their friends in neighboring apartments that YOUR apartment is a good place to find yummy things.  You may be killing them but you'll be attracting them faster than you can kill them. </p>

<p>It didn't work for me. It may, however, be an excellent solution in a single family detached house in which one brought roaches in with the groceries. In that scenario you have a given amount of roaches and when they're gone - the problem is gone.</p>
"
"<p>It will not damage the machine; However, it won't brew properly.  Your tea is supposed to steep inside the water for a set period of time; but the Keurig will simply pour water quickly through it, resulting in extremely weak tea.</p>

<p>So no, it won't damage the machine, but you will not brew your tea correctly.</p>
"
"<p>There are several approaches that can aid in developing your palate.</p>

<h2>Cupping</h2>

<p>The preferred method of tasting coffee. This requires only a cupping bowl and spoon. Dose out coffee, pour in the hot water evenly, and at 4 minutes skim off the top to remove the crust while carefully not disturbing what has settled at the bottom. Wait about 12-14 minutes for the coffee to cool to a desirable drinking temperature, and slurp the coffee with the spoon.</p>

<h2>Types of flavors</h2>

<p>There's a variety of descriptions you can use to describe the coffee. Try describe everything. The mouth feel: is it full bodied or light? The acidity: Is it citric or stone fruit? The Smell: What are the aromatics?</p>

<h2>Note keeping</h2>

<p>Every time you taste coffee, keep notes of what flavors you taste. Basic notes of chocolate or smoke are fine, more nuanced flavors like cherry or plum may come out. Don't be afraid to write exactly what comes to mind. If the coffee tastes like captain crunch then write it!</p>

<h2>Comparing coffee</h2>

<p>Don't just taste your coffee by itself. Compare it to other roasts you've done. Compare it to coffees from other cafes as well. Note the differences.</p>
"
"<p>The answer is <em>dependent on the coffee you're serving</em>. I've worked with several blends from different companies and have found that some are better with resting than others. What's key here is the flavor added from the aromatics, or the crema. I've worked with very light roasted espresso blends and found that if I let it sit for about 30 seconds, the flavor was more pronounced. With a more medium roasted blend, I found that if the coffee wasn't consumed quickly, the pleasant flavors dissipated. </p>
"
"<p>I'd like to experiment with roasting my own beans at home.</p>

<p>I'd like to keep the equipment requirements as basic as possible. No fancy gizmos or machines. I have a gas stove. </p>
"
"<p>I want to dabble in home roasting.</p>

<p>Where can one typically source unroasted beans from? Do roasters typically sell unroasted beans to the public? I have never seen unroasted beans for sale in a store. </p>

<p>I'm not asking for specific store or supplier recommendations, more so the general avenues to source unroasted beans.</p>

"<h1>Cold Brew Coffee - A Brief look at Flavor Profiles</h1>

<p>My company builds flavor profiling and quality control tools for the craft beverage industry, using machine learning, data science, and analytical chemistry - let's use some of our 20,000+ coffee reviews to answer this question with <strong>data</strong>.</p>

<p>It has been claimed for some time that cold brew as a method of extracting coffee only exists to minimize the amount of acidity in the flavor profile. This is only a third of the story, and may not be true for the coffee you brew or consume! </p>

<p>So what is the full story? Read on! </p>

<hr>

<h2>Acidity in Cold Brewed vs Hot Brewed Coffee</h2>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/lVwmT.png"" alt=""Sour &amp; Acidity in Cold Vs Hot Brewed Coffee""></p>

<p>These two beautiful graphs show the difference in sour &amp; acidity in cold Vs hot brewed coffee. The graphs show that hot brewed coffee has a much larger range in the perception of acidity - and is on average <em>more</em> acidic than its cold brewed counter part. </p>

<hr>

<h2>Differences in Average Flavor Profile</h2>

<p>But what about the rest of the flavor profile? Are people really planning to cold brew for hours in advance just for marginally less sour acids in the brew? </p>

<p>No. Higher-end cafes and roasters are producing cold brew coffee to target consumers who want a different flavor profile- optimized for consumption at a different temperature. </p>

<p>For this section of the analysis, I will be using the Gastrograph to communicate complex flavor profiles consistently and simply. On the Gastrograph, the intensity is shown ranging from 0, the center of the graph, to 5 (the outer most point).  </p>

<p>Let's look at the difference in flavor profiles below: </p>

<p><strong>Full Immersion Cold Brew Coffee</strong>
<img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/BHdhv.png"" alt=""Average Cold Brew Full Immersion Coffee"">
This is the Gastrograph of the average Cold Brew Full Immersion Coffee. </p>

<p><strong>Full Immersion Hot Brew Coffee</strong>
<img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/NdOob.png"" alt=""Average Hot Brew Full Immersion Coffee"">
This is the Gastrograph of the average Hot Brew Full Immersion Coffee. </p>

<p>As you can see, these coffees differ on a much greater number of axis than simply sour and 
acidity - the goal is to make a different product with its own unique flavor profile, not to simply reduce acidity.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Differences in Flavor Profile by Brewing Method</h2>

<p>Finally, Cold Brew is actually an entire class of production methods that involve infusing coffee into cold water. There are 2 primary types: </p>

<p>(<strong>Reminder:</strong> Coffee brewed with hot water, and then iced is <em>not</em> Cold Brew coffee.) </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Full Immersion Cold Brew</p>

<ul>
<li>Fresh </li>
<li>CO2 Draft</li>
<li>Nitrogen Draft </li>
<li>Bottled </li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Ice Drip </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Let's look at the 2 most interesting types of cold brews from the list above:</p>

<p><strong>Stumptown Draft Cold Brew</strong> </p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/xyNjr.png"" alt=""Cold Brew Draft"">
 This coffee is served from a beer keg and pressurized with CO2. </p>

<p><strong>Stumptown Nitro Cold Brew</strong> </p>

<p>This coffee is served from a beer keg and pressurized with nitrogen; the effect is a much smoother and fuller coffee, with a very thick and present mouth feel. 
<img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/PR6CJ.png"" alt=""Nitro Cold Brew""></p>

<p>The cold brew coffee you make at home will be much closer to the average cold brew shown in the previous section, as I suspect few of the readers here will be making batches large enough to keg! </p>

<h3>Update: Very Short Chemical Analysis</h3>

<p><strong>How do the concentration of compounds salicylic acid, phenolic acids, and amino acids differ between cold brew and hot brewed coffee?</strong></p>

<p>It is not so much concentration that matters - it's perception. For example, phenolic acids are mostly volatile; in hot coffee more are evaporating, thus you can more easily perceive them. The same is true for salicylic acid (a precursor to aspirin, which is acetylsalicylic acid). </p>

<p>Also, These acids are more readily soluble and easier to extract in hotter environments. In cold brew not only do you extract fewer molecules of the acid, but the ones that you do extract will trigger a less potent olfactory response.</p>

<p>Amino acids are a trickier issue. The chemical nature of amino acids greatly varies (like in polarity and size, functional groups, etc). Most free amino groups will be consumed during roasting via Maillard non-enzymatic browning. On average, the cold brew would extract more, simply because it would have more time to come out of the coffee (during the average 6-hour steep time). </p>

"<p>There are several websites that sell unroasted or green beans in a range of quantities and will ship.

I order 12 pounds at a time from <a href=""https://www.sweetmarias.com/store/"" rel=""nofollow"">Sweet Marias</a> and they ship in a flat rate USPS box; so shipping is very reasonable and only adds roughly a dollar per pound (for a twelve pound order).</p>

<p>I started with one and after I decided I was hooked I spent the money on a commercial made roaster, but I learned most of what I know with a hot air popper in my front yard.  I think the biggest issue for stove top roasting is the smoke.  If you don't have great ventilation in your house over your stove, accidental overroasts and dark roasts become a major problem.</p>

"<p>That will completely depend on the blend of espresso you are using.  Different coffees will have different pull times.</p>

"<p>Working on a Synesso (prototype), I was lucky enough to be able to play with controlled pre-infusion. <a href=""http://www.fivesenses.com.au/blog/2014/06/19/pressure-profiling-using-the-synesso-hydra"" rel=""nofollow"">They state</a> that their pre-infusion has a pressure of 3-4 bars and "" bring[s] an extra textural element to your brew in the form of a greater volume of crema. It can also lead to a more syrupy mouth-feel overall."" I find this to be mostly true if the pre-infusion was used for about 5 seconds.</p>

<p>What I found through personal experience was that, if I kept the pressure consistent, not switching to the full 9 bars, the shot pulled at the same extraction rate, finishing at my desired time. So Keeping dose, time, and extraction the same, the only variable was pressure. I found that the most notable change was a <em>reduction in brightness.</em> The more pronounced acidity and citric flavors were <em>dulled</em>. There was however a silver-lining that gave the pre-infusion a redeeming quality: Because of the reduction in brightness, I found that when using <em>really fresh</em> coffee ( &lt; 4 days old), the pre-infusions reduction in brightness took away from the character metallic taste found with fresh coffee. For that reason, when I am dealing with fresh coffee, I may increase the pre-infusion time (from 5 to 9 seconds for example) and this helps make the espresso palatable. </p>

"<p>According to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decaffeination"" rel=""nofollow"">Wikipedia</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Decaffeinated drinks contain typically 1–2% of the original caffeine content, and sometimes as much as 20%
  [Decaffeination]  is repeated from 8 to 12 times until the caffeine content meets the required standard (<strong>97% of caffeine</strong> removed according to the <strong>international standard</strong>, or <strong>99.9% caffeine-free</strong> by mass as per the <strong>EU standard</strong>).</p>
  
  <p>A controlled study of ten samples of prepared decaffeinated coffee from coffee shops showed that some caffeine remained. Fourteen to twenty cups of such decaffeinated coffee would contain as much caffeine as one cup of regular coffee. The 16-ounce (473-ml) cups of coffee samples contained caffeine in the range of 8.6 mg to 13.9 mg. In another study of popular brands of decaf coffees, the caffeine content varied from 3 mg to 32 mg. An 8-ounce (237-ml) cup of regular coffee contains 95–200 mg of caffeine, and a 12-ounce (355-milliliter) serving of Coca-Cola contains 36 mg.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In contrast, your average dark chocolate bar sees <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=caffeine%20chocolate&amp;rlz=1C1CHFX_enUS425US425&amp;oq=caffeine%20chocolate&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.4196j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;es_sm=0&amp;ie=UTF-8"" rel=""nofollow"">12 mg of caffeine per serving</a>.</p>
"
"<p>We have yet to invent a process that removes 100% of the caffeine. When drinking decaf, the important question to consider is how likely you are to feel the effects of the trace amounts of caffeine that are left. That brings us, as most things do, back to the beans.</p>

<p>Arabica has (on average) only <em>half</em> of the caffeine that Robusta contains. Now let's say you have a bag of Robusta where 80% of the beans have 1 - 2% of their original amounts, and 20% of the beans have 15% of their original amounts. Drop by drop, a shot of Robusta is <em>much</em> more likely to keep you awake or elicit other natural responses to caffeine than an identically-sized shot of Arabica.</p>

<p>But let's take that into context and not pick on Robusta so much - the single shot we mentioned might only contain 20mg of caffeine in total, meaning you wouldn't notice the effects any more than you would notice effects from the Arabica. The point is, you <em>could</em>, so if you want to avoid caffeine, go with the milder bean and faster extraction.</p>

<p>Just goes to show, when you're talking about the characteristics of any coffee, the bean is pretty paramount - it can change the answer to any question completely in many cases.</p>

"<p>The other day, I spoke to a tea fanatic. he introduced me into tea world and also explained me, that harvest time of tea leaves has significant role in tea quality. (Especially the <em>first flush</em> which is the first harvest in given year)</p>

"
"<p>According this <a href=""http://www.rsc.org/chemistryworld/Issues/2011/May/ChemistryInEveryCup.asp"">article</a> about the chemical composition of coffee, 12% of the dry weight of green unroasted coffee beens are chlorogenic acids. It does not mention if these acids fully dissolve in water when brewing coffee.</p>

<p>Furthermore they are mentioning <em>""over 1000 aroma compounds""</em>. Do they dissolve?</p>

<p>All together, is a cup of coffee a solution or an emulsion? If it is a solution, is there such thing as a maximum saturation level for a cup of coffee?</p>
"
"<p>A cup of coffee is definitely a solution, in the sense that it is composed of dissolved solutes. The solvation occurs once water is introduced. While, there is always a limit to how much of a substance can be solvated in a given amount of solvent, with coffee you're likely to not reach the point of creating a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supersaturation"">super-saturated solution</a> in normal conditions. If you were to take a pot of brewed coffee, and boil it, removing the solvent (water) you will likely reach a point as to where the solution is supersaturated, followed by precipitation of a crude extract.</p>

<p>Now is coffee an emulsion? I have heard that typical brewed coffee contains oils from the bean (likely oils that can be seen on darker roasts). If this is the case, then we could say that coffee is both a solution <em>and</em> an emulsion!</p>

"<p>When steaming (semi-skimmed) milk with the steam wand on my Espresso Machine I tend to end up with quite an even texture throughout. I always steam the milk until it reaches the 'steam zone' on my thermometer which is between 65 and 70 degrees Celsius. My technique for steaming the milk is to 'skim' the steam nozzle on the top of the milk so as not to create huge bubbles.</p>

<p>However, I only have this one technique for steaming milk, therefore I can't distinguish between say a cappuccino, flat white, or latte - which each require varying amounts of steamed and foamed milk.</p>

"<p>There are several ways to roast your own coffee at home on low budget:</p>

<h1>Pan</h1>

<p>This is one of the extremely minimalistic ways to roast coffee, but the degree of complexity is very high as the coffee beans need constant attention due to the nature of the heat that arrises only from one side.</p>

<h1>Oven</h1>

<p>This is likely one of the most common ways to roast coffee at home and a significant step up from the pan, hence the heat is more homogenous. You are still required to mix the coffee now and then hence the plate usually becomes hotter than the upper part of the coffee beans while in the oven.</p>

<h1>Popcorn machine</h1>

<p>This is likely the best method to use at home, but also very messy as the chaff is likely to twirl around while the coffee is being roasted. A method for catching the chaff could be a simple filter that can tolerate heat or a oversized strainer.</p>

<h1>Roasting tips</h1>

<ul>
<li>Never leave the coffee while roasting, the process can escalate very quickly and turn your beans into coal</li>
<li>Cool down your beans quickly after the roasting process, do not leave it on the heat source</li>
<li>Coffee generates chaff which has to be disposed, this is usually a pain when roasting in the oven and pan.</li>
<li>Use a thermometer so you can log the roasting time and duration for analysis.</li>
<li>Roasting can generate a lot of smoke so either roast outside, near a window or use ventilation.</li>
</ul>
"
"<p>You should heat your coffee upto about 70 degrees Celcius so it builds a foam or froth but do not let it boil! You need to keep it at this stage for as long as you can, and if the coffee starts to get to hot and appears to rise then move it off the heat and repeat at most 2 times.</p>

<p>A few important things are</p>

<ol>
<li>use fresh coffee or it will not foam as well</li>
<li>pre-heat the water in the pot first, without the coffee, just until it starts to heat up</li>
<li>do not stir until the coffee sinks itself</li>
<li>allow the coffee to heat slowly, not on a high heat (I don't directly place the pot on the heat ring - slightly off of it)</li>

"<p><strong>Yesterday I had a way too big, way too strong cup of 100% Robusta.</strong> I had never tried pure Robusta before, so I had no idea what I was getting into. I experienced strong caffeine effects 6+ hours after consumption, and had mildly shaking hands + felt a little ill for six more hours (and then I went to bed).</p>

<p>I'm fine now, but <strong>what could I have done (or eaten, drunk) to weaken the effects of said cup?</strong> There are ""home remedies"" for hangovers, and if one has eaten too spicy food, bread is usually good. What works on caffeine?</p>
"
"<p>What you experienced was a <a href=""http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002579.htm"">caffeine overdose</a>, however mild, and that's something that you shouldn't really try home remedies to correct. Had you gone to the emergency room, you probably could have expected to been given a laxative, activated charcoal, and possibly I.V. fluids. I doubt that they would have pumped your stomach over a single cup, but they might have if your heart was beating irregularly. </p>

<p>Absorption of most things you swallow generally depends on how much you've had to eat - so yes, eating something filling (e.g. bread soaked in water) would <em>probably</em> have alleviated some of the discomfort, especially if you had the coffee on an empty stomach. Staying hydrated (but not over-hydrated) would also have been important. </p>

<p>I wouldn't advise self-medicating in circumstances like this, all you can do is be very mindful of symptoms getting <em>worse</em> (particularly any sign of irregular heart activity) while you wait it out and (eventually) crash into bed. </p>

<p>But, bread / crackers / water - not going to hurt, and <em>might</em> make you feel a little better, or better sooner. While symptomatic, I wouldn't take anything over the counter or prescription unless you checked with a doctor (because of possible heart implications)</p>

<p>And really, if you feel at all beyond 'blaugh' - you should see a doctor quickly. People die from too much caffeine, and it's not pretty, so be careful.</p>

"<p>I searched around a bit and found a few recipes for coffee concentrates, but most of them read more like high test cold brew recipes.</p>

<p>My first thought was to take drip coffee and cook it down and reduce it into a concentrate, has anyone tried this? </p>

<p>Am I way off track? Is there a better way?</p>
"
"<p>It's more of a syrup than a concentrate if I recall correctly. While it's a whole lot of flavor in a little container that needs to be diluted in order to reconstitute, it's not like heavily concentrated coffee that's been cooked down, as you mention.</p>

<p>You could try strong coffee and any gum that you'd use in cooking to make a relatively thin non-sweet syrup, I'm <em>pretty</em> sure nothing in any common bean would prevent them from binding. What you'd have to look out for is the tincture possibly damaging the machine, which leaves very little room for trial and error (or margin for error at that). You'd also have to watch out for machines that need to 'validate' the capsule as 'authenticated' before agreeing to make coffee. </p>

<p>Note, I'm assuming you mean those ""Nespresso"" machines or similarly clever abominations. But anyway, even for other applications, a syrup made using a strong espresso would probably work the best.</p>

"<p>Apparently, drinking caffeinated beverages shouldn't affect you calcium level if you get your recommended daily intake of calcium. According to <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12204390"" rel=""nofollow"">this review</a> of the literature on the subject:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There is no evidence that caffeine has any harmful effect on bone
  status or on the calcium economy in individuals who ingest the

<p>That said, there does seem to be a connection between high caffeiene intake and low calcium intake, meaning that there is significant overlap between individuals who drink caffeinated beverages and don't get enough calcium from their diets, but implying a causal relationship is dubious.

"<p>I know some people who refuse to drink in large coffee chains as they say that the coffee they produce tastes ""burnt"".</p>

"
"<p>Just make cold brew! It's called ""cold brew"", but you can still make good hot coffee out of it.</p>

<p>Cold brew is essentially hyperconcentrated, but slow-brewed, coffee. It's very popular in the United States in the summer, because it's very easy to make excellent iced coffee with a cold brew concentrate. (Just add water and ice.) But you can also make a cup of hot coffee out of cold brew concentrate: just add hot water instead of cold water and ice. </p>

<p><a href=""http://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-make-coffee-concentrate-to-serve-hot-coffee-to-a-crowd-cooking-lessons-from-the-kitchn-187198"" rel=""nofollow"">Here's a recipe</a>, but I'll summarize it.</p>

<p>You need: </p>

<ul>
<li>~12 oz coarsely ground coffee</li>
<li>~6 cups water</li>
</ul>

<p>Pour water over coffee in a large bowl or pitcher and stir. Cover with a tea towel and let sit on the counter (or fridge) for 24 hours. You can vary the coffee:water ratio and brewing time depending on your preferences. Strain thoroughly. Reserve the delicious liquid and discard the grounds. The concentrate will keep in the refrigerator for up to a week. </p>

<p>To make a cup of hot coffee, add about 2 parts hot water to 1 part cold brew (depending on your taste). Add the hot water slowly until it's tasty to you. Dilute with a similar amount of cold water for iced coffee - then add ice. Add milk, sugar, and other fixings as desired. (If you're drinking it iced, you'll want to use <a href=""http://www.foodandwine.com/recipes/simple-syrup"" rel=""nofollow"">simple syrup</a> to sweeten, since plain sugar won't dissolve well in cold liquid.)</p>

"<p>Burn? I've heard that some large chains ""burn"" their beans while roasting :-) But not while brewing.</p>

<p>A major coffee chain, seen on almost every other corner in some places, is known for their very dark, ""burnt"" roast. Many people like this sharp taste and associate it with caffeine and their morning pick-me up.</p>

<p>Other people find this ""burnt"" roast to be overwhelming and consider this heavy roast to be destructive when using high-quality beans. In any case the burning happens at roast - not when brewing.</p>
"
"<p>I used empty capsules to fill my own coffee and brew it using a Nespresso machine. I would say the result largely depends on the coffee you use, but not the capsules itself. It takes several tries until you get the right amount of coffee into one capsule (I had to stuff one brand of coffee quite tight to get a crema at all), and the amount differs very much from coffee to coffee. Of course, the grind matters a lot, but you can compensate with the amount of coffee.</p>

<p>The only problem I had with the capsules is that sometimes they got stuck when discharging, but you can usually fiddle them out using a fork or so.</p>
"
"<p>I'm a big fan of the elegant simplicity of Cory Doctorow's <a href=""http://boingboing.net/2013/07/20/cheap-easy-no-mess-cold-brew.html"" rel=""nofollow"">coffee concentrate recipe</a>. Not quite as much of a syrup as others here have described, but it's a great way to get quality out of medium quality beans. </p>

<p>My tweaks: I use a 5:1 water:coffee ratio (usually 1 liter of water &amp; 200 grams of beans). Instead of a coarse grind, I use a medium grind. I steep for 12-15 hours. I tend to use medium-dark roast beans (Costco often has 2 pounds of Major Dickason's pretty cheap, and those work fine if you don't have anything else available).</p>
"
"<p>You're on the right track for good foam by keeping the tip of the wand close to the surface. To end up with less foam, submerge the tip as the temperature rises and the hiss drops to a whisper; I usually dip down after the first 15 or 20 seconds or so for a latte, longer for a cappuccino.</p>

<p>When you hear milk ""screaming"" in coffee places, that's the sound of a submerged wand in cold milk. The result is milk that tastes flat and has little or no foam. As long as you keep the wand near the surface until the milk warms up and quiets, you can experiment with time and depth until you're getting the results you want.</p>
"
"<p>When I go to a coffee shop, I see many different coffees. There are these cheap powdered coffees that don't taste too good, ground coffee, and whole coffee beans. On the internet or in specialty shops, you can find even more types of coffee. What could help me judge coffee quality? For example, I know that with tea the rule of thumb is that bigger, looser leaves are of better quality. Moreover, the first harvest is the most precious one. Do similar rules apply to coffee? What are other general rules that signify better coffee?</p>
"
"<p>I've had coffee that tasted burnt in a lot of cheaper restaurants and from common coffeemakers in homes. It's uniformly been stuff that's sat on a warmer for a long time (like, an hour or more) after brewing. Keeping coffee on heat after brewing ""cooks"" it down, just as keeping a soup or sauce on a simmer reduces it. However, it has the opposite effect on coffee than on sauces or soups; instead of making it richer, it destroys the more delicate flavor compounds and makes it taste burnt. Even reheating coffee in the microwave can make it taste more like an ashtray than coffee.</p>
"
"<p>This is a fairly general question, so pardon me for a slightly generic answer.</p>

<p>First thing you'll want to consider is the quality of the coffee itself.  Typically, the more expensive a coffee is, the higher quality it will be.  It's the age old phrase, 'You get what you pay for"".</p>

<p>Secondly, the less steps from it being picked to it being in your cup, the better.  Packaged, ground coffee has more steps (Packaging, grinding) before being brewed.  Whole bean coffee has less.</p>

<p>Third, the longer it's been ground, the longer it has had to degrade.  You'll want to grind your whole-bean coffee as close to the time of brew as possible.  Oxygen will erode the flavor of the coffee over time.  Ground coffee has more surface area to be exposed to oxygen.</p>

<p>I hope this addresses what you were asking properly.</p>

"<p>Coffee is at it's heart and agricultural product and suffers from some of the same issues apples do plus some additional ones stemming from it's need to be roasted/stored/ground and brewed before use.</p>

<p>Different strains of arabica beans will produce varied tasting quality similar to the types of apples.  However, even the highest quality plants still need to be tended to and grown in the right environment.  So farming methods and location play a part.  </p>

<p>After a coffee cherry is grown and picked, it must be processed to get at the bean.  The fruit must be removed somehow and there are various ways to do this, any or all of which can influence the final flavor of the coffee.</p>

<p>Those beans are then often sorted to create homogenous lots of coffee beans, some folks will claim that this sorting can influence final outcome as well.  Assuming the green beans are properly stored and shipped, they arrive finally at a roaster.  </p>

<p>A roaster has potentially the most influence on the final outcome.  They may blend different lots of beans base on a want for a particular flavor profile (or to save money).  And they decide what roast either fits their business model or is best for the beans.  The very same batch of beans will produce drastically different cups of coffee (or espresso) based on the roast level.  Then there is storage of roasted beans.  Some companies grind their coffee before sale, which increases the rate (drastically) at which coffee stales.  Others sell the beans whole.  These will stale too and the rate depends on storage time and method.  </p>

<p>Finally there is the actual method of brewing.  There is a myriad of methods, with some new ones even invented in the last decade.  Any of which can drastically alter the taste of the final product cup of coffee.</p>

<p>Coffee is such a large industry that there are studies and information out there on each step of the process assuming all other variables the same.  One could literally write a book with multiple chapters covering each step of the process.  You still wouldn't be able to come up with any definitive answers because the final step is someone's taste buds and we all have different preferences.   </p>

"<p>If you live in a hard water area then clean using a citric acid solution and make sure that the pumps are then empty of water.</p>

<p>You could if it's easy remove the gasket seal (if there is one) which sits on the metal fine filter where the coffee is pumped through, this is to avoid any residue drying and gunk/mould forming on the seals.</p>

<p>It may depend on your model how easy access some of this. If you have a bean to cup then you'll need to clean the waste bin and empty the bean hopper.</p>

<p>Finally store it in the original box, somewhere that isn't humid and you should be fine.</p>

<p>When you fire it up again, you'll need to pump water fully through (again you could use a citric acid solution) and restore the gasket seals. I can't think of anything else you could do.</p>

"<p>One of the common regular maintenance items for an espresso machine is to descale it, to remove the buildup of minerals inside the machine (particularly the heating element).</p>

<li>What are the benefits of regular descaling?</li>
<li>What do I need to do this?</li>
<li>How do I actually go about descaling the machine?</li>
</ul>
"
"<p>You can use a solution of citric acid and some espresso machine manufacturers will sell this specifically, you can use general purpose descaler, for which there should be instructions on how much to dilute it by.</p>

<p>Talking from experience it depends on how hard the water is where you live and you should really do it every month if it is a hard water area.</p>

<p>I also found that I need to remove the fine filter where the coffee is pumped out to remove the gasket seal and clean all of the above, I was lazy and neglected my Gaggia for about 6 months and after a couple years the solenoid pump died.</p>

<p>The less hassle method would be to use bottled soft mineral water. For instance I have started to only use this with my kettle and there is no limescale build up since switching 1 1/2 months ago, whilst before, using Brita filtered water would start to show limescale after a week and I'd need to descale after 3 weeks.</p>

<p>These are the instructions on my descaling solution for a coffee machine:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Add 100ml of solution to 500ml of water and add to water reservoir,
  turn on and run through the machine. Then run 2 full reservoirs of
  water before using again.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I remember with citric acid you had to pump it through and then leave for 30 minutes and then fully flush a few times.</p>

<p>Here is a youtube video from Gaggia about performing this: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SPkjWJzUJQ"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SPkjWJzUJQ</a></p>

<p>The key thing here is that if you don't do it then limescale starts to form on the metal filter and gasket seals which will affect the flow rate. This isn't the worst bit though, like with any heating system that uses hard water, the hard limescale will inhibit the heating and pumping performance which can lead to a complete pump failure which is what happened to my machine, I recommend using citric acid (which is a weak acid and safe to consume in diluted form) and/or bottled mineral water.</p>

"<p>As far as I've seen, flavored coffee is created by putting the beans in a tumbler with the desired syrup flavor.</p>

<p>Is there a method to create flavored coffee without using syrups or other sweeteners?</p>

"<p>Sweet Maria's is a good place to start: <a href=""https://www.sweetmarias.com/library/roast-coffee/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.sweetmarias.com/library/roast-coffee/</a></p>

<p>They've got quite a bit of information on the coffee roasting process as well as suggestions on hot air roasters and methods.</p>

<p>Personally- I'd skip the stovetop roasting and the oven roasting. It's useful in so much as you learn the major stages of coffee roast development (color shifts / smells / cracks) but it's EXTREMELY hard to roast coffee evenly, which means you'll learn enough to be quickly dissatisfied with roasting this way.</p>

<p>A hot air popper is a really good place to start. I had a hard time getting consistent roasts (and didn't want to get into modding right away), but the quality was so much better than anything I could do in/on the stove. You can get one on Amazon for ~$25... </p>
"
"<p>I believe there are several ways to make flavoured coffees without syrup or sweetener.</p>

<p>For example, I make vanilla coffee by mixing fresh vanilla seeds with finely ground medium-roast coffee, and seal the mixture for some time (duration depends on the weather). The result is quite nice, with a slight touch of vanilla. This is <em>not</em> a product---just for personal use and still exploring. The difference with syrup or essence or flavouring is that the touch feels lighter and more natural.</p>

<hr>

<p>A basic mechanism here is to mix ground coffee with some spice, and let the mixture sleep for flavour to spread.</p>

<p>Another mechanism is to put some spice directly in a container with roasted beans. This seems more appropriate for spices like cinnamon (no need to extract seeds like for vanilla).</p>

<p>I have not tried to mix spices with <em>green</em> beans, as the roasting stage changes a lot of things, but that should be an interesting path.</p>

"<p>Many siphons use a small piece of metal wrapped into a fine cloth. The piece of metal makes them robust, and it seems to me they can be used for a long time.

<p>How long do you recommend to use a siphon filter? What would be the criteria to drive for change?</p>

"<p>Asking around, I've noticed that public opinion about the french press is rather mixed. I've heard people shun it and others praise it. I have never actually seen a decent explanation why though.</p>

<p>As for advantages, I can tell that it's obviously pretty simple to use. Only hot water and ground coffee is required to operate it, but I'm sure that this process of making a cup of coffee must have some effect on the taste.</p>

<p>What effect does this have then, does this change the bitterness, dilute the taste? Is the pour-over method superior?</p>
"
"<p>It depends on the press. I personally use a double-walled (which means air-insulated) press with very very fine screens in the plunger. This means my coffee stays hot for quite some time, and I don't commonly have issues with grounds at the bottom of the second cup (it's a 2-cup press). </p>

<p>I also spent over $300 for it, hand made in Japan by expert crafters with some beautiful stainless steel hardware framing it. It's actually <em>guaranteed</em> to resonate at a certain frequency if you wet your finger and run it around the rim. I digress. </p>

<p>Most presses can have some or all of the following issues:</p>

<ul>
<li>Grinds leak through the screen on the plunger quite easily, even with a good coarse grind</li>
<li>Coffee can fall below serving temp before you plunge it if you're not careful</li>
<li>They are a bit of a pain to clean, most can't go <em>near</em> a dishwasher</li>
<li>They tend to be rather fragile</li>
<li>They can stain with certain kinds of water, depending on the glass used</li>
<li>Some argue that the taste of a coarse grind is inferior to finer grinds (a matter of taste is difficult to document)</li>
</ul>

<p>The actual mechanics of making the coffee is very simple. Mix the grinds and water, then using a screen, separate the grinds from the water. The taste is going to depend more on how clean the press is, the quality and temperature of the water, the quality of the bean, grind, how long you let it brew, etc. The same holds true for pour-over brews, provided that the filter is decent and doesn't add its own taste.</p>

<p>I personally prefer my press, but it's really a matter of preference. I don't mind cleaning it, in fact one of the reasons I went with a press a while back was in hopes that the prospect <em>of</em> needing to clean it would slow down my consumption. Didn't work.  I love the consistently-good brews I get out of mine, and I love that it keeps my second cup hot long enough for me to enjoy the first.</p>

<p>Some people <em>do</em> mind the quirks, and prefer not to use them. Something decent usually starts at around $40, so they're not prohibitively expensive for experimentation. All I can say is try both and see what you think.</p>

"<p>I'm just getting into the coffee world, and I'm assaulted with words such as latte, espresso, etc. What are the basic differences between coffee preparations like espresso, cappuccino, and latte?

"
"<p>I've been using a French Press for years. There are real cons to using it as opposed to using a drip coffee. </p>

<p>It takes considerably longer and requires more work. A drip filter requires that you grind and put in the coffee; add water to the required level and press start.</p>

<p>A French Press requires that you wait for the water to boil; grind the coffee just right - not too fine, not too coarse; pour in the water; stir; wait 4 minutes for the coffee to steep; stir again; plunge AND then pour.</p>

<p>I happen to like the routine EXCEPT when I'm in a hurry and then I have to hurry back and forth. </p>

<p>... 
Start the water to boil; go and shave; grind the coffee and pour the water; go get dressed ....</p>

<p>When done right there is a wonderful viscosity to the coffee; you taste and have mouth feel considerably different than with a drip coffee.</p>

<p>Re bitterness - you taste the bean and the roast. If it's bitter then the coffee is bitter. </p>

<p>Re diluting the taste. NO. Not if done correctly. (Which will take a few brews the first time through.)</p>

<p>In my experience the lovers of the french press point to the mouth feel, the viscosity of the coffee. The value of this taste sensation is entirely personal. </p>
"
"<p>The taste of a well-made French Press-brewed cup is made complete (in my opinion) by the velvety, full-bodied richness that can only be described as ""mouthfeel"". Which aspects of this brewing method cause that quality to be highlighted?</p>
"
"<p>More of the oils in the coffee remain as opposed to being filtered out. The coffee sits in the water, nothing is filtered out. The plunger leaves the oil in the coffee and prevents the grinds from going into the coffee cup (unless you used a very fine grind in which case the fine particles will go through the filter).</p>
"
"<p>The French Press has the major advantage of allowing more control of the extraction of your coffee.  The longer you seep or press, the greater your extraction.  The major disadvantage is that depending on your grind, screening etc, you will end up with more particulate matter in your coffee than a paper filter will let through.  There is also some discussion surrounding a paper filter removing some of the natural oils present in coffee.  Some people interpret this particulate matter as body, some people see it as a ""less clean"" tasting cup of coffee.</p>

<p>The brew method most people prefer tends to tell you something about how they like their coffee.  I really prefer no grounds in my coffee, so for me, a French Press isn't involved in making my perfect cup of coffee.  My closest coffee geek friend will swear by his, and has all manner of methods for reducing the grind in his cup, and or dealing with them, because he just doesn't mind them that much.  He sees grind in his cup as just part of the process and for me, it ""ruins"" my cup of coffee.  Those are just personal preferences, neither is right.</p>

"<p>My findings are that it's actually exactly the same.  <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peaberry"">Peaberry beans</a> occur in almost all coffee in some percentage.  They aren't grown separate, they are the exact same coffee that's been sorted out of the processed beans so that the lot looks more homogeneous and sells better.  I've actually been lucky enough to at one time have peaberry, oversized and ""regular"" beans all from the same lot.  The coffees all tasted exactly the same to me.  I have a friend that claimed he tasted some difference in in the larger beans, owing perhaps to not having been roasted as thoroughly.  </p>

<p>The beans I had were Sumatran Toba Batak, sold in sorted lots of 17+, peaberry and regular.  I am sure that almost any processing station you went to in the world could do such processing if they chose, although it's probably labor intensive and would add some cost to the beans.  If Tanzania is doing it regularly, they have probably found it's financially worth it.  On occasion when I look closely at the beans I am roasting, I'll usually find a few peaberries in the mix.</p>

"<p>Ordinary white vinegar works just fine, but the smell bothers some people. If so, use citric acid.

"<p>If you're only brewing a cup at a time, just don't drink the last sip - the grounds will have settled and you won't like it.</p>

<p>If you're brewing several cups at a time, then move it from the press into an insulated container - not only does this give the grounds a chance to settle out <em>before</em> they're in your cup, it'll keep the coffee fresh longer. </p>

<p>I use an inexpensive airpot to hold and dispense hot coffee after brewing in a press. This allows the coffee to be dispensed without disturbing the grounds that have settled, and keeps it at the perfect temperature all day long if need-be.</p>
"
"<p>Probably not, although more possible for financial reasons.  Shaking a coffee drink would either require a more sturdily constructed disposable cup, which would cost more money and create even more waste or a reusable shaker which would require cleaning in between customers which would cost money and time making the drink.  Either method would also incur a significant risk of losing the prepared drink in its entirety, necessitating a restart.  For a business, it's much less risky to simply let you customers stir their drinks.</p>

"<p>While using a Nespresso Virtuoline, the machine seems to read a barcode on the capsules which tells it how much water to use.  The high intensity espressos seem to give you a very small quantity (about .3 oz with maybe .2 oz crema).  </p>

"<p>So Tom Medley has a great answer, but its pretty much based on your temperate climate biases.  Coffee is grown in the tropics/sub tropics, and time of year has much less effect on us then it does in temperate zones.  I pick coffee all year round, with great flavor, although twice per year the output shoots up, locally we call this harvest time.</p>

<p>The important point here is not time of year, but maturation time for each bean.  When I pick coffee there are ripe red beans, maturing beans, green beans and flowers on my plants.  Said a different way, there are beans at different stages of production.  To be picked 'at the right time'  means waiting for each bean to be big and red and ripe, and not pick it before, or long after that point.  This is what really matters for the quality.</p>

<li><p>Convert the pulp into dry measurements. Do this by subtracting the amount of water you added. You can find this amount by calculating exactly how much coffee you initially put into the coffee maker, minus the amount of coffee that was produced. This amount will be very small, but it will affect the mass of the final pulp. Measure out an equivalent amount of water (which is usually measured by volume rather than weight) and weight it on your scale, being sure to subtract the weight of the container from your final measurement. Subtract the weight of the water from the weight of the pulp.</p></li>
<li><p>Multiply the dry measurement by the amount of caffeine in that type of coffee. If you made instant coffee and have 2 grams of dry instant, for instance, you will multiply this into 3,142 and divide by 100 for a final answer of 62.84 milligrams of caffeine in the coffee pulp.</p></li>

"<p>Some say that keeping a portafilter in the grouphead is both beneficial for the machine <em>and</em> affects the quality of the espresso (by keeping the portafilter warm).</p>

<p>Is this accurate? If so, what are the benefits of doing so?</p>
"
"<p>Keeping the portafilter warm (and receiving / tamping a dose within a warm portafilter) is supposed to result in additional oils being released in the extraction, which in theory leads to a fuller pull and more crema. It's also supposed to add to the benefits of pre-infusion.</p>

<p>I have experimented at length with this, and <a href=""http://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/137/does-pre-heating-a-puck-on-the-group-head-produce-more-crema"">can detect positively no difference between a shot extracted from a cold filter, and one extracted from a warmed one</a>. It might only be noticeable on higher-end (larger) machines, or simply larger filters. </p>

<p>Mechanically, it's a sound enough practice as it would help keep the group head and portafilter from warping independently, even ever so slightly. Even though the seal they make is assisted by the inclined plane the filter travles to reach the head, it's still good for the filter to mate properly with the machine.</p>

<p>I asked my barista about this after Joel mentioned it, and he also said it's a good practice to keep. </p>

<p>tl;dr; It can't hurt, and it might help, but YMMV on lesser machines.</p>

<p><strong>edit</strong></p>

<p>Experiments in various presses, and the amount of crema they produce have shown that pre-warming <em>metal</em> filters produces more crema. This eluded me because I own a pretty good machine that heats the filter quickly after it has been attached to the machine.</p>

<p>The accuracy would depend on your machine. The result <em>could</em> be more crema, and everything that a fuller extraction entails. </p>

<p><strong>suggestion</strong></p>

<p>Try it on your machine and see if it makes a detectable difference.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The first capsule-based espresso system able to work in the extreme
  conditions of space is here. It is called ISSpresso and is the
  brainchild of two Italian companies — Argotec and Lavazza — in
  collaboration with the Italian Space Agency</p>
  
  <p>Turin, 13 June 2014 – “An espresso coffee is what I miss most aboard
  the International Space Station.” We have repeatedly heard this
  comment from the Italian astronauts who for 13 years have been at
  times working in the International Space Station, and today their
  espresso wish is about to become reality. In fact, Argotec and Lavazza
  are working together with the Italian Space Agency (ISA) to actually
  bring the authentic Italian espresso onto the International Space
  Station. So in the Futura Mission — the second long-term mission of
  the Italian Space Agency aboard the Space Station — another Italian
  astronaut of the European Space Agency, Air Force Captain Samantha
  Cristoforetti, could not only be the first Italian woman to go into
  space, but also the first astronaut in history to drink an authentic
  Italian espresso in orbit. </p>
  
  <p><strong>Its name is ISSpresso.</strong> It takes its name from the International Space
  Station (ISS), where it is to be installed. It is the first
  capsule-based espresso system able to work in the extreme conditions
  of space, where the principles that regulate the fluid dynamics of
  liquids and mixtures are very different from those typical on Earth.
  ISSpresso is the product of a project run by Argotec, the Italian
  engineering company specialised in the design of aerospace systems and
  European leader in the preparation of healthy and nutritious foods for
  in-space consumption, and Lavazza, the historic Italian coffee brand.
  ISSpresso is a veritable technological and engineering jewel, able to
  deliver a perfect espresso in weightless environment. This is why it
  was selected by the Italian Space Agency to be used aboard the ISS, in
  the framework of the Request for Expression of Interest that the
  Agency keeps constantly open to public-private partnership projects
  and activities to be carried out in the ISS. </p>
  
  <p>“Italian coffee is a beverage without borders — comments <strong>Giuseppe Lavazza, Vice President
  of Lavazza</strong> — and we have been thinking about taking the espresso into
  space for some time. Indeed, as far back as ten years ago we launched
  the espresso into orbit artistically with the photographs taken by
  Thierry Le Gouès and our Mission to Espresso calendar, which at the
  time may have looked like a work of science fiction but was actually
  just a vision of the future. In fact, today we are in a position to
  overcome the limits of weightlessness and enjoy a good espresso — the
  indisputable symbol of made in Italy products — on board the
  International Space Station. We are proud to have worked on this major
  project with Argotec, through the Lavazza Innovation Center, our
  division dedicated to research and product innovation: a scientific
  and engineering challenge which we hope will improve the living and
  nutrition quality of astronauts engaged on long missions.” </p>
  
  <p>“Our aerospace engineers — stated <strong>David Avino, Managing Director of Argotec</strong>
  — have designed a new-concept coffeemaker, which is safe for the
  astronauts and able to function in microgravity conditions, also
  thanks to Lavazza’s experience as a leader in capsule extraction 2
  systems. The functional project was already completed in June 2013:
  Argotec had been working on it for about one year. This is an ultra
  high-tech project which has led to innovative solutions, applicable
  with immediate returns on Earth as well. ISSpresso is a technological
  challenge that meets very stringent requirements, imposed by the
  Italian Space Agency, in terms of technical functionality and safety.
  In addition to the engineering aspect, Argotec is also taking care of
  the European astronauts’ training and nutrition. Food provides an
  important psychological support and being able to enjoy a good Italian
  espresso may be just the right way to finish off the menu designed
  especially for each astronaut, helping him or her to feel closer to
  home.” </p>
  
  <p><strong>Roberto Battiston, President of the Italian Space Agency added:</strong>
  “ISSpresso is a perfect example of the way ISA's decision to make ISS
  national usage rights available to public-private partnership
  initiatives can result in a valorisation of public resources for
  technological, economic, and social objectives. The ISA will bring
  ISSpresso aboard the ISS, thanks to bilateral cooperation agreements
  with the NASA, as it shares with the project partners the objective of
  improving the quality of life of ISS astronauts, as well as the
  astronauts who will take part in future long interplanetary
  exploration missions. At the same time, we are also proud to
  contribute to the promotion of the image and spreading of the
  Made-in-Italy brand at international or better “space”, level.” </p>
  
  <p><strong>A coffee break in space.</strong> A prototype of the space coffee machine is
  currently being tested at Argotec’s laboratories and all the necessary
  functional and safety checks. In a subsequent phase, Finmeccanica –
  Selex ES will participate in the assessment activities aimed at
  launching ISSpresso into orbit with the Futura Mission crew, one of
  whom is the Italian astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti. The ‘corner
  café’ on the ISS will be the hub for socialising on board the Station,
  a sort of social network in space, a venue for getting together,
  chatting and relaxing: an aspect that should not be ignored in
  missions that keep the astronauts away from home for many months in a
  very challenging environment. The innovative capsule system will also
  be able to prepare not only a regular espresso, but also a caffè lungo
  or hot beverages, such as tea, infusions and broth, so that food can
  also be rehydrated. </p>
  
  <p><strong>Extra-terrestrial technology.</strong> Every tiniest detail
  of ISSpresso is designed to respond to a scientific and engineering
  challenge: in fact, the machine studies have enabled principles of
  physics and fluid dynamics to be tackled, such as the difficulty of
  handling liquids at high pressure and high temperature in a space
  environment. Just think that the plastic tube carrying the water
  inside a normal espresso machine has been replaced with a special
  steel tube <strong>designed to withstand pressure of more than 400 bar.</strong> The
  machine is so complex that it weighs <strong>about 20 kilograms since there
  are back-ups of all the critical components for safety reasons in
  accordance with the specifications agreed upon with the Italian Space
  Agency.</strong> ISSpresso represents a technologically high-value project
  which, besides increasing the variety of flavour in the astronauts’
  menu, will help improve our understanding of the principles of fluid
  dynamics and conditions in microgravity. Some of the solutions adopted
  have led to international patents, which will be useful both for
  future space missions and immediate terrestrial use...</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>tl;dr</strong></p>

<p>It looks like its a heavy duty capsule system designed to withstand high pressure that not only makes coffee, but makes tea, broth, infusions and re-hydrates food. </p>

"<p>According this <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee#Legendary_accounts"">legend</a>, somebody called Sheik Omar chewed on coffee berries when living in exile. It is mentioned he found them too bitter at the time. But is it <em>possible</em> to eat them?</p>

<p>Also, according <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffea#Ecology"">wikipedia</a>: <em>""The caffeine in coffee ""beans"" is a natural plant defense against herbivory, i.e., a toxic substance that protects the seeds of the plant.""</em></p>

"<p>I love a bag of <a href=""http://www.whittard.co.uk/confectionery/chocolate-sweets/dark-chocolate-coated-espresso-beans.htm"">chocolate coated coffee beans</a>, but I do tend to eat them much like any other sweets (read: in large quantities with little to no restraint). Whole bags within arms' reach will vanish. Am I ingesting a dangerous amount of caffeine? How much caffeine is there in a (~150g) bag of chocolate coffee beans compared to a pull of espresso?</p>

"<p>I have a small cafetiere for making French Press coffee. I can't remember what it said on the box when I bought it - it's quite old - but it seems similar to those advertised as '2-cup' size. </p>

<p>Making coffee with it, filling it all the way up, makes a decent mugfull - what I'd consider enough for one person. Is this actually two 'servings' of french press? When I calculate how much caffeine I'm taking in, should I double the values given for French Press?</p>
"
"<p>Kahlúa is coffee rum. It's delicious, but is it just regular rum mixed with coffee, or is there more to it than that? Is coffee added before distillation? Is the coffee somehow fermented?</p>
"
"<p>I'm going to assume that you've had an espresso. It's a small-cup of coffee extracted under very high pressure. It's delicious by itself and some like to add sugar. </p>

<p>So, what is a latte?
Take a shot of espresso and add steamed milk </p>

<p>What is a cappuccino?
Take a shot of espresso and add steam milk.</p>

<p>So, what's the difference between a latte and a cappuccino? Are they the same thing?</p>

<p>No. (Unless you're in a really bad diner in which case you shouldn't be ordering lattes there.)</p>

<p>There are several differences between a latte and a cappuccino.</p>

<p>One is the ratio of milk to espresso. A cappuccino is 1-1 milk to espresso and the latte is 2-1 milk to espresso. </p>

<p>Another difference is that the milk is treated differently. In a latte the milk is heated as opposed to being frothed. In a cappuccino the milk is frothed (converted into a microfoam) to about double it's original volume. (If you've ever heated or foamed milk you'll have noticed how the milk changes state as it's being heated.) </p>

<p>Finally the way the milk and espresso are combined is different. In a latte the heated milk and espresso are poured together into a serving cup. Whatever microfoam might have been created while heating the milk is then poured over the top. In a cappuccino the frothed microfoam is poured over the espresso.</p>

<p>It gets more involved than this but I'll let others answer those questions. </p>

"<h2><em>TL;DR</em> Yes, they are edible and non-toxic to humans.</h2>

<p>Coffee cherries, as they are properly called, are a thin papery skin and attached mucilage (what we think of as the flesh of the fruit). Coffee cherries are consumed as a drink, cascara, by coffee farmers in Latin America. </p>

<p>Coffee cherries contain more caffeine than coffee, on average, as they do not go though a roasting process. Depending on the green processing / pulping / milling process the coffee went through, coffee cherries often have a bitter and gamy flavor. </p>
"
"<p>From <a href=""http://www.kahlua.com/bean-to-bottle/"">Kahlua's website</a> it looks like they process sugar cane into molasses, ferment it, and distil it before adding coffee. The coffee, vanilla, and caramel is added eight weeks before the mixture is filtered and bottled. </p>

"<p>There was already a question <a href=""http://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/63/milk-quantity-and-consistency-in-cortado-cappuccino-and-latte"">here</a> that someone answered with an image showing drink recipes, but it's worth noting that these are loose definitions and that the actual recipe can vary based on the cafe you examine. </p>

<p>Starting with an espresso base and going from smaller to larger ratios of milk:
Espresso &lt; Macchiato &lt; cappuccino &lt; latte</p>

<p>Espresso: Full coffee flavor
Macchiato: 1:1 ratio, flavor leans towards coffee 
cappuccino: 1:3 ratio, flavor should be balanced
latte: 7-? ozs of milk, mostly milk flavor</p>

<p>Acidity and bitterness will depend on your coffee, but as noted above coffee flavor dissipates when you add more milk.</p>

"<p>FDA has no official guidelines on serving size, so your serving size is either determined by the product manufacturer, or whatever you want it to be. We don't know what brand french press you have but if it was <a href=""http://bodum.bodum.com/us/en-us/cms/552/102392/"" rel=""nofollow"">Bodum</a> for instance: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Coffee is measured in 4 oz. cups, so our 3-cup press will brew 12 oz.; a single serving.</p>
</blockquote>
"
"<p>To be honest, with all of the variability in coffee, if you want completely accurate numbers, you'd have to prepare multiple samples of your coffee brewed the same exact way (preferable 3 or 4 samples to be sure of consistency), and send this off to an analytical chemistry lab, where they will use a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_spectrometry"" rel=""nofollow"">Mass Spec</a> instrument (maybe <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_chromatography%E2%80%93mass_spectrometry"" rel=""nofollow"">GC-MS</a>) to determine content. The reason you don't see more cafes displaying numbers for their caffeine content is because this testing can get expensive. </p>

<p>Your specific example of brewing with a french press will also have trouble being determined because we don't know your grind size (exposed surface area), and we don't know your dose. Caffeine yield is directly related to dose. </p>

<p>Also that Mayo Clinic study is very, very, poorly cited because it just gives names of journals and years, not specific studies, issues, or authors. I based on there being no direct trace to it's source, like just listing multiple sources that are properly cited, I would say that that article is not a reliable source of information. </p>
"
"<p>In the past I have made up to 2L of coffee using a french press and stored it in a flask that I have brought to lectures. Sometimes I will continue drinking this after 5 days, but it tastes pretty bad.</p>

<p>Two related questions: Is it bad for my health to drink after two weeks? Does it lose caffeine over time?</p>
"
"<p>The <a href=""http://www.espressoitaliano.org/en/"">Italian National Espresso Institute</a> requires the following properties for a <a href=""http://www.espressoitaliano.org/files/File/istituzionale_inei_hq_en.pdf""><em>certified</em> Espresso</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Water pressure: 9 bar ± 1</li>
<li>Percolation time: 25 seconds ± 5 seconds</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm using a Quickmill Pegaso 3035, and for some coffees I do have a much higher pressure (around 12-16 bar). However, the percolation time is around 25 seconds, the coffee has a good crema and tastes fine.</p>

<p>Are there any downsides because of the high pressure? Does it alter the taste? Would I get more crema if I reduced the pressure?</p>
"
"<p>I have a 12-cup (51 oz.) Bodum French press. Generally how long am I supposed to wait for the freshly pressed grounds to steep before I decant?</p>
"
"<p>Moka pots (or stove top percolators) usually produce a pressure of around 1.5 bar, while most coffees require a pressure of at least around 6 bar for a crema to appear. However, there are some Moka pots with a special valve (called Cremator) which helps creating more pressures and thus produce a crema.</p>

<p>By the way, a <em>real Espresso</em> has to be brewed with a pressure of 9 bar ± 1, according to the <a href=""http://www.espressoitaliano.org/files/File/istituzionale_inei_hq_en.pdf"">Italian National Espresso Institute</a>, so it can't be brewed with a Moka pot.</p>
"
"<p>Sometimes I get distracted, and realise I've got a cold cup of coffee on my desk. Will reheating it in the microwave do bad things to it? I've heard people say it will alter the flavour, and some people even say that the effect of the microwave on the coffee will produce medically harmful chemicals. Is this true? Should I just chuck it and make a fresh brew?</p>

"<p>I bought a coffee from Caffè Nero in the UK. It came with this lid:</p>

<p>What do all the letters mean? I'm assuming DECAF could be marked to distinguish a decaf in a large order, but why is it there twice? What about the other letters? What about 19 near the air hole? Why does it say NO LID?? </p>
"
"<p>I follow the steps in <a href=""https://www.stumptowncoffee.com/brew-guides/french-press"">the Stumptown Roasters guide</a>, which actually features a Bodum French Press. <strong>The answer is 4 minutes</strong>, but it includes a mixing step after the 1 minute mark. From the site:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""...pour hot water (30 seconds off the boil or about 205 degrees F) into the French press, saturating all of your grounds, and pouring to the halfway mark. Start your timer for 4 minutes.</p>
  
  <p>After 1 minute, stir the “bloom” (or top layer) and pour the rest of the water evenly to the top and affix the press pot lid.</p>
  
  <p>After the 4 minute timer goes off, plunge and serve.</p>
</blockquote>
"
"<p>Although coffee generally becomes staler with time, heating coffee up in the microwave <strong>does not</strong> produce any harmful chemicals - as long as the container you are microwaving it in is microwave-safe.</p>

<p>The microwaves emitted inside the microwave are a relatively safe form of radiation that cause the <strong>water</strong> molecules in the coffee to move faster, thus creating heat. This is relatively harmless.</p>

<p>As far as taste goes, you may consider just making a new coffee, as this will always taste better, in my opinion!</p>
"
"<p>If I make a batch of iced latte, that is to say I make a regular latte then pour it over ice, how long can I keep a batch fresh in the fridge? A day? A week? If the milk is the limiting factor, could I make a batch of espresso, chill that, and add milk as and when to get the same drink, or would it taste different if prepared this way?</p>
"
"<p>The question title says it all: My colleague wanted to try my coffee, so he grabbed one bean of coffee (roasted) and chewed it up.</p>

<p>After several minutes, he claims, that it has positive effects on him (feels ""juiced up)</p>

<p>Obviously, I am wondering now: Is it just placebo effect, or is there any possibility to feel this after chewing up only one bean?</p>
"
"<p>Would you drink plain water from a container 2 weeks later? If not then don't do it with coffee. </p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<p>I have finished half drunk water bottles and found the water to be stale. However, based on Chris in AK's comment I'll have to rethink my answer. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I very regularly drink ""old"" water that is in a sealed container. In fact, the growler sized flask on my desk was probably last filled over a month ago and I'll still sip out of it today. It definitely doesn't taste fresh, but it's fine.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This news changes the equation.</p>
"
"<p>First I want to draw a comparison between how much caffeine is in a coffee bean versus a cup of coffee, a cup of tea, or a double espresso.</p>

<p>In a standard cup of coffee, there is approximately 150 mg of caffeine. In a cup of black tea, steeped for 3 - 5 minutes there is approximately 50 mg of caffeine. In a double espresso there is approximately 60 - 90 mg of caffeine depending on the roast, grind, extraction time, etc.</p>

<p>In one dark roasted espresso bean there is approximately 6 mg of caffeine according to <a href=""http://www.caffeineinformer.com/caffeine-content/coffee-beans"">this source.</a></p>

<p>If a person is <strong>extremely sensitive</strong> to caffeine, they would probably be able to feel the effect of 6 mg of caffeine. However, if someone is a coffee drinker, the likelihood that this caffeine is actually affecting them is <strong>very</strong> unlikely.</p>

<p>If your friend never ingests soda, coffee, tea, or caffeine in any form then he <strong>may</strong> have felt some of the effects. In my opinion, the majority of the way your colleague was feeling was probably a placebo effect.</p>
"
"<p>I am pretty sure it says NO TL316 LID.  That's the item/stock number for that particular size lid (based on a Google search, also available in black!). There are basically two sets of initials for the same thing Decaf, (C)ream, (S)ugar, (C-S) Cream and Sugar, and then one set has the B for Black.  Presumably these could be grease penciled or highlighted on a large order.</p>

<p>I honestly have no idea on the 19.  It may be some sort of internal tracking mechanism for manufacturing, because other examples from a Google image search have different numbers there.</p>
"
"<p>When I worked in a coffee shop and we prepared a beverage similar to an iced latte, we always mixed the milk in with the chilled espresso. Keep in mind this was a beverage prepared ahead of time and not server to the client right away.</p>

<p>We <strong>NEVER</strong> added dairy to espresso and then chilled it for later.  It has been shown that 1 liter of milk can develop harmful bacteria after being in a room temperature space for as little as half an hour.</p>

<p>I would highly recommend that you <strong>do not</strong> prepare your iced lattes completely with milk and then chill them.</p>

<p>I recommend making the espresso, adding whatever sugar or flavor you want while it is still hot, chilling it in the fridge, and then adding milk to the espresso once it has been chilled or when you are looking to drink it. <strong>This will keep for a maximum of 48 hours.</strong></p>

<p>As with all coffee, the fresher the better, but if you are indeed looking for a quick way to grab an iced latte, I would do so in the manner I described.</p>
"
"<p>There are a few factors at play here. The temperature that the coffee is brewed at and how well the flask holds that temperature are primary.</p>

<p>While the coffee stays hot the caffeine level will decrease. The speed will depend on the temperature and the amount of caffeine to start with (which is thoroughly discussed in other questions here).</p>

<p>When the coffee cools bacteria growth will start. At what point this bacteria become dangerous not only depends on temperature but also how clean the flask was to begin with and what quality water is being used. Clean tap water in the US, brewing coffee in a very clean french press, and placed into an incredibly clean flask could last two weeks (although it would taste terrible and have little caffeine) but if any of those steps is less than ideal there is a good chance of bacteria growth. Some people's guts will handle that bacteria without a problem, other people may get sick.</p>

<p>Edit: I should point out that as I have researched more I'm less certain about the statement regarding caffeine levels over time. Caffeine should not burn at any temperature coffee is left at, and it does not evaporate. So either experiments that say caffeine levels decrease are wrong or the reason it decreases is not clear. Some suggest that bacteria eats the caffeine, which does tie into why it becomes less safe to drink over time.</p>
"
"<p><a href=""http://www.caffeineinformer.com/caffeine-content/coffee-beans"">This</a> seems to suggest that there is approximately 7mg of caffeine per coated bean.  I've no idea how much those weight per piece, or how many are in a bag, but the math should be fairly easy if you have access to such things.</p>

<p>I found another manufacturer of a similar product which claims 40g for 28 pieces. Extrapolating that for your 150g bags gives roughly 700mg of caffeine, which sounds like way too much.  This could very greatly of course between manufacturers depending on chocolate thickness/weight.</p>
"
"<p>I am curious. How many coffee plants do I need to harvest for beans in order to brew myself one cup of coffee (7g of ground, processed beans).</p>

<p>If it is less than one, then how many cups of coffee can I theoretically brew from one plant?</p>
"
"<p>It all boils down to three questions:
1) Yield = How much did you get from the grounds?
2) Strength = How much ended up in the cup?
3) Ratio = What did you get there?</p>

<p>Yield: Yield pertains to how much soluble you took from the coffee grounds. Ground coffee has something between 27-30% of its mass being soluble, that is, stuff you can dissolve in water. If you kept boiling and boiling coffee grounds in water, eventually you’d get everything that the grounds have to give. Above 22-24%, however, and you’ve essentially reached too far or squeezed too hard, because unpleasant flavors will emerge. Below 18%, and you’re not getting enough out of the coffee, at worst, leaving the coffee with underdeveloped flavors or simply wasting coffee. So it sort of answers the question, “How much did you get from the grounds?”</p>

<p>Strength: Pertains to how much of the final brew is coffee, and how much is water. SCAA Golden Cup says 1.15-1.35% brew strength is a desirable zone to the most number of people, though we espresso-lovers tend to like a bit more… something like 1.3-1.5% brew strength. Over 1.5, up to 2.0% or more, and you’re in the “heavy, thick” coffee zone. Simply put,“How much ended up in the cup?”</p>

<p>Ratio: Simply, grams per liter. It provides one of the major answers to the question that Yield and Strength might ask, that is, “How did you get there?” Perhaps the most easy-to-remember ratio is 60g/L, or 60 grams of coffee for every one liter of water. The fact that you can make a balanced, pleasing, delicious cup of coffee at 60 g/L should give any barista pause when they’re finding that they’re using 80 grams or more per liter when they’re making coffee. Is it “wrong” to make coffee at 90 g/L? No… but is the additional 50% of coffee yielding an additional 50% of coffee quality, compared to the barista down the street making superb coffee at 60 g/L?</p>

<p>For the assistance of common men like me,
<img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/Rjtoe.gif"" alt=""YEAHAHAHA!""></p>

<p>Then, to clarify the actual number, if Arabica then 1 - 1.5 pounds per cycle and if Robusta 2 - 2.75 pounds. And then you can calculate the rest. ;)</p>

"
"<p>This question can only be answered generally because of a few factors.</p>

<p>The factors that can change the answer are</p>

<ol>
<li>The type of coffee plant</li>
<li>Where it is grown</li>
<li>How it is grown (as a tree or as a bush)</li>
<li>Peaberry ratio</li>
</ol>

<p>The good news is a fully developed coffee tree that has at least a decent harvest will produce more than a cup of coffee. Maybe as much as a pot (~10 cups). If it is a large and very well developed tree maybe even 2 pots of coffee.</p>

<p>The bad news is it will take at least a few years to get any kind of decent harvest.</p>
"
"<p>Given that coffee evolved caffeine as a way of poisoning predators, are (caffeinated) used grounds suitable for composting? Apparently caffeine deters some bacteria and funghi which could affect the way it breaks down into compost?</p>
"
"<p>As an avid composter I can say that I have always used lots of coffee grounds and my compost has always done well with it. There are a few reasons why it is beneficial:</p>

<ul>
<li>used grounds are fairly pH neutral. If your compost is too acidic they even help a little by absorbing extra acid. Unused grounds however would add to acidity.</li>
<li>coffee grounds are considered ""green material"" in compost lingo which is usually what compost piles need more of, as opposed to brown material that is fairly abundant in average land plots (maybe not for apartment composters).</li>
<li>coffee grounds attract worms, so even if some bacteria are harmed the worms are compost rock-stars and they make up for it</li>
</ul>

<p>A good rule of thumb with composting is everything in moderation, so there is such thing as too much used coffee in the pile. When I empty my indoor compost bin into the outside bin coffee is generally 10-25% of that green material.

"<p>Estimation is all well and good, but if you <em>really</em> want to know <strong>exactly</strong> how much caffeine is in your cup, you're going to have to measure it!</p>

<h2>Basic Mode</h2>

<p>You can get caffeine testing strips that you can dip into coffee, and they'll give you an idea of how much caffeine is in the brew.</p>

<p>D+Caff is one brand I found but there may be others. They look like this:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/SGv2d.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>The strips have a couple of lines on them, marked D and C. Decaffeinated beverages will only rise to the D line, caffeinated beverages will rise above it.</p>

<p>You do have a problem that you're going to have to bust out some science to calibrate this thing yourself - out of the box it will not actually measure the amount of caffeine in a drink, but if you try it on some drinks with known amounts of caffeine you should be able to work out a system of measurement.</p>

"<p>As far as I know the aroma is gone first, the oils begin to dry out and the taste goes down as well. I don't know how long it takes the caffeine to go away. I have drunk coffee over a year old and there still was caffeine. (I go camping and there was a bag left over from the previous year.)</p>

<p>On a different note - as a lifelong NYer I don't see how living in a small space precludes having a grinder. Even - gasp - a cheap krup kitchen grinder is better than buying bags of store ground coffee. (IMHO) Although I would buy a hand grinder instead. </p>

"<p>There are many different varieties of coffe, but cafea arabica and cafea robusta are two different species grown in my region of Colombia, robusta specifically grown for its increased resistance to disease and pests.  But how are these two species differentiated in the quality of the prepared drink?</p>
"
"<p>In the tropics I know that coffee requires some elevation, but increasingly coffee is being grown in the subtropics.  What are the necessary and sufficient conditions for growing coffee?</p>
"
"<p>Robusta is often used to ""cut"" blended coffee because it is most often cheaper to purchase than Arabica beans.  Since it generally has a higher level of caffeine than Arabica, it may also be used to up the ""kick"" of blended coffee.  </p>

<p>Robusta is generally though to have an inferior flavor to Arabica, partially because the extra caffeine imparts some bitterness, but also perhaps because of it's growing conditions.  While some very few places out there may strive to produce superior Robusta beans, they are working against a market that generally considers it an inferior product and will not pay as much for it.  Therefore less care is often given to Robusta plants and processing since the return on investment is lower. </p>

"<p>I found <a href=""http://www.coffeeresearch.org/agriculture/environment.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">this website</a> which prescribes the following subtropic and equatorial growing conditions.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The subtropical regions, at high altitudes of 16-24° (Illy, 21). 
  Rainy and dry seasons must be well defined, and altitude must be
  between 1800-3600 feet.  These conditions result in one coffee growing
  season and one maturation season, usually in the coldest part of
  autumn.  Mexico, Jamaica, the S. Paulo and Minas Gerais regions in
  Brazil, and Zimbabwe are examples of areas with these climate
  conditions (Illy, 21).</p>
  
  <p>The equatorial regions at latitudes lower than 10° and altitudes of
  3600-6300 feet (Illy, 21).  Frequent rainfall causes almost continuous
  flowering, which results in two coffee harvesting seasons.  The period
  of highest rainfall determines the main harvesting period, while the
  period of least rainfall determines the second harvest season. Because
  rainfall is too frequent for patio drying to occur,  artificial drying
  with mechanical dryers is performed in this type of coffee growing
  environment. Examples of countries that have this climate are Kenya,
  Colombia, and Ethiopia (Illy, 21).</p>

"<p>I read everyone's answer and did some of my own research to find an estimation method that satisfies me and might be helpful to others too. I think it should be roughly ±20% accurate.</p>

<h1>For any amount of ""good strength"" American-style coffee by any brew method, weigh the dry coffee in grams and multiply by 0.008, or 80mg of caffeine for each 10g of dry coffee.</h1>

<p>Weakly extracted coffee might yield 0.6% of its weight in caffeine and very strongly extracted coffee might get close to 1% caffeine. </p>

<p>These numbers are for typical 100% Arabica or mostly Arabica blends. 100% Robusta beans (uncommon) could be about double the caffeine.</p>

<p>Explanation below:</p>

<h2>Maximum caffeine content</h2>

<p>Typical premium roasted Arabica coffee beans like mine contain <a href=""http://www.academia.edu/6246212/Analytical_Methods_Measurement_of_caffeine_in_coffee_beans_with_UV_vis_spectrometer"" rel=""nofollow"">close to 1% caffeine by mass when measured by spectrophotometer (p 311)</a>
though Robusta (less common and usually blended with Arabica in cheaper coffees) has
<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robusta_coffee"" rel=""nofollow"">roughly twice that
much</a>. </p>

<p>If you have a health concern like wanting to stay under the 300 mg guideline for pregnant women, you should be able to use this as the upper limit: <strong>each 10g of Arabica coffee contains about 100mg of caffeine.</strong></p>

<p>I use a 2 Tbsp scoop to measure beans before I grind them. One scoop of
beans weighs about <strong>12 grams</strong> (yes I tared the scoop, but I did only weigh
once and am not comparing light or dark roasts which will vary in weight
and volume).</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/NwqDW.jpg"" alt=""2Tbsp scoop of beans weighing 12g""></p>

<p>So if I <em>eat</em> that scoop of beans or grind them finely and drink them
with any amount of water I will be consuming the <strong>120 mg (1% of 12g) of caffeine</strong>
present in them. That should be an upper limit to this estimation
exercise. <em>The strongest <strong>or</strong> biggest/weakest cup of coffee I can brew with
that scoop of beans will have <strong>no more than</strong> 120mg caffeine</em>. </p>

<h2>How strong is my cup?</h2>

<p>Typical American-style brewing methods and water ratios result in 
<a href=""http://www.mountaincity.com/brewing-1.html"" rel=""nofollow"">1% (weak) to 1.65% (too strong) disolved coffee solids, with 1.25%
considered optimal</a> whereas 
<a href=""http://www.coffeechemistry.com/brewing/brewing-fundamentals.html"" rel=""nofollow"">""a typical espresso will contain on average 1.8-2.2%""
solids</a></p>

<p>So 1 fl oz of brewed coffee or espresso weighs almost the same as water
(29.57 g) and contains 1-2% coffee solids (so about 300-600mg, or 380mg solids for optimal brewed coffee and 600mg solids for espresso). That would be the upper limit if the coffee solids were pure caffeine, but they can't be. </p>

<p>On the other hand,the caffeine is probably more soluble than the other parts of the bean,so even though it's only 1% of the mass of the beans it's probably more than 1% of the dissolved solids. That's the hard part. [Coffeechemistry.com says brewed coffee ends up with 8-15 mg caffeine per oz and espresso 30-50 mg caffeine per oz (<a href=""http://coffeechemistry.com/caffeine/caffeine-content-in-espresso-vs-drip-coffee1.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://coffeechemistry.com/caffeine/caffeine-content-in-espresso-vs-drip-coffee1.html</a>). That's a pretty huge range. It means caffeine is 2.5-4.0% of the solids (380 mg) in an ounce of ""optimal"" brewed coffee or 5.0-8.3% of the solids (600 mg) in an ounce of espresso.</p>

<p>So: I typically make a nice strong 10 oz cup of coffee with my 12g of
beans containing a maximum of 120mg (or 1% of the coffee mass) caffeine. So let's say this maximum 12 mg caffeine per each oz of coffee corresponds to 1.65% or 500 mg solids (1.65% of 29.57 gr = 500 mg). In this case the 12 mg caffeine is 2.4% of the solids. If I brew it ""too weak"" and it ends up 1% solids (or 300 mg per oz) I would guess I'd proportionally get no more than 60% of the max caffeine, 7.2 mg (again 2.4% of the solids) per oz or 72 mg for a 10oz cup. So that narrows the range to 72-120 mg of caffeine in my cup depending on the brew strength.</p>

<p>I'm guessing a good cup ends up somewhere in the middle, so I'm going to estimate my typical cup contains <strong>around 100 mg of caffeine from its 12g dry coffee,</strong> or about 80% of the maximum caffeine present in the beans. From this I would suggest a decent rule of thumb for ""optimal"" strength American-style brewed coffee is around <strong>0.8% (or 0.008) of the mass of the beans used, or 80mg of caffeine for each 10g of dry coffee.</strong></p>

<h3>Bonus corollary/sanity check</h3>

<p>Using the same method, a shot of espresso made with <a href=""http://www.coffeeforums.com/forum/coffee-drinks/2733-how-much-grounds-used-make-espresso.html"" rel=""nofollow"">7g of ground
coffee</a> maxes out around 70mg caffeine (77mg if 10% Robusta sometimes typical for Espresso blends), but the serving size and strength are more standardized than brewed coffee, so the <strong>64mg/shot</strong> reported by <a href=""https://www.google.com/#q=caffeine%20in%20espresso"" rel=""nofollow"">the USDA and others</a> also ends up being 80-90% of the caffeine present in the beans.</p>

<li>Obviously, I do not plan to sell it for business, just for my own purposes.</li>
</ul>

<p>So, theoretically: Am I able to actually produce me coffee in ""drinkable"" quality? </p>
"
"<p>I work at a company of about sixty people. Like most offices, there's a communal coffee machine in our break room. It's what I understand to be a typical drip machine, pretty confident it's a <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B000BN7W8O"">Bunn VPS 12</a>.</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/MCNGt.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>The <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B00I8GC9E8"">grounds</a> used are Maxwell House.</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/x1Kd4.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>The filters are pretty generic looking, and the water is straight from our local tap.</p>

<p>The end result of all this could charitably be described as burnt water.</p>

<p>I know you can spend pretty much any amount of money on beans, roasters, grinders, presses, additives, and everything else that could possibly be coffee-related. But I'm not trying to make the <em>best imaginable</em> cup of coffee. I'm trying to make about 200 <em>decent</em> cups of coffee a day, for relatively little investment.</p>

<p>I've cleaned out the machine with <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B00CHNK5XA"">Goo Gone coffee maker cleaner</a>, to no significant effect. Past that, everything I can think of involves permanent changes to the process, and I want to have some way to justify that before I push for it. Where would my investments of money and political capital be best directed?</p>
"
"<p>The easiest step would be to swap out the Maxwell House coffee for something of higher quality.  If there are local roasters nearby, check to see if they do wholesale or bulk orders, and then order some 5lb. bags of coffee from them.  Since the idea is to keep costs low, they should be able to grind it for you ahead of time so that you won't have to add the cost of a grinder for the time being.</p>
"
"<p><strong>Coffee beans</strong> - I mean the type of coffee you actually drip. Exchange the coffee for 100% arabica coffee. it does not have to be even single source coffee. Good start for <em>decent</em> cup of coffee is ... You bet, it is Starbucks.</p>

<p>While I personally am in movement away from Starbucks, it should be good choice for decent cup of coffee for reasonable price</p>
"
"<p>Excuse the rookie question, but I am a newbie to coffee. (I blame my nationality; I grew up with tea. ;) )</p>

<p>What equipment, exactly, do I need to get from coffee beans to a cup of espresso that I can drink? </p>
"
"<p>Easiest thing is a bean to cup machine like any of <a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/b?node=368204031"">these</a>, these will grind a pre-measured amount of beans, heat water and pump through into your cup and dispense the used grounds into a grounds bin internally.</p>

<p>Going the other way you need a minimum of some form of grinder (preferably burr type) which can be manual or electric.</p>

<p>A 'normal' espresso machine like <a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/Espresso-Cappuccino-Machines-Home/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=10706951"">these</a> which may or may not have a milk frother.</p>

<p>You can opt for a digital scale machine to weigh your beans, possibly mineral water if you hate descaling your machine.</p>

<p>The scales are for measuring an accurate amount of beans, I do this because I have a manual grinder. The water is cheap still mineral water because I live in the south of England and the water is so incredibly hard that it has tattoos.</p>

<p>Also you need cups to drink the final product.</p>
"
"<p>My suggestion would be that you stop using the machine and take a pour over cone or french press and your own grinder to work.  The reality that I have found is that most people are willing to drink horrible coffee so long as it is free.  And that given that choice, most people would rather drink free horrible coffee than good coffee they have to pay for.  I tried for a long time to have a ""coffee pool"" at my office.  What I found is that a couple of people payed me money every now and again, but mostly, my good coffee just got poached by people that didn't notice the difference between it and Folgers.  I am much happier making my own cup of coffee when I want and not dealing with anything political or financial with my fellow employees. </p>
"
"<p>If you think you can get some money but not a lot, I'd start by switching to whole-bean coffee and purchasing both a grinder and air-tight containers to store the coffee in. Even cheap coffee tastes much better when it's fresh and freshly ground. Buy a mid-range grinder and two airtight containers (one for whole beans, and one for grounds). At the start of every day, you can grind enough to get you through the day. Coffee is best when it's used within about 2 weeks of being roasted and ground, though it'll still be drinkable longer than that, especially if stored properly. </p>

<p>The other thing you can do that doesn't cost any money is to experiment with how much coffee you use per pot. I've been in a lot of offices where people assume that more grounds automatically means better coffee, but adding too many grounds can lead to a very unpleasant bitter, metallic, or acidic taste. So try adding slightly less coffee when brewing a fresh pot and see if that helps, even if you don't change anything else.</p>
"
"<p><a href=""http://www.coffeeflavoroils.com/How_to_Flavor_Coffee_Beans.htm"">This site</a> seems to suggest that the best time is just after the beans are roasted and still warm and ""open"", which makes some sense.  However, it does state that many flavorers cold flavor the beans and simply add more flavoring oils to make up for the reduced absorption.  I can't think of anyone that would flavor the beans before roasting.  Not only would the high heat of the roasting risk degrading the taste of the flavoring oils, it would also affect the roasting process and flavor the roasting equipment.</p>

<p>As for distribution, I believe most of the flavoring agents are fairly potent and the process is a sprinkling or pouring then mixing, and not a soaking.</p>

"<p>I make drip coffee (pour over for North Americans) at home and I would like to know: what exactly is coffee bloom?</p>

<p>When I pour the initial amount of water the grounds swell up, and sometimes there is a minor eruption if I'm not careful, but is this just air trapped in the grounds and water solution trying to escape or is this CO2?</p>

<p>Does this affect flavour? What affects the volume of the bloom?</p>
"
"<p>According to this <a href=""http://cupandbrew.com/blogs/cupandbrew-blog/12135009-what-is-coffee-bloom"">site</a> it's a by product of the roasting phase and occurs naturally hence the reason coffee bags have a degassing hole.</p>

<p>When you grind the coffee the trapped gases are released and when the hot water hits it, this releases the gases quicker.</p>

<p>Factors aside from storage that can affect this phenomenon are:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>Temperatures that the beans were stored at.  Hotter means more gas release.</li>
  <li>Humidity levels during storage.  Dryer levels allow more gas to escape.  Of course, high humidity levels may encourage mold and fungus
  growth so you need to find a happy medium.</li>
  <li>Bean hardness.  Harder beans mean more density for the gas to make its way through.</li>
  <li>Roast level.  Roast level will have a large influence on bloom.  Extremely dark, oily, Italian roasts have a much lesser amount of
  out-gassing compared to exact same coffee roasted Full City.</li>
  <li>Origin.  Some coffee origins are known to have more out-gassing than others.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>if your coffee doesn't bloom at all or very little then it's likely to
  be stale or over-roasted.</p>

"<p>I would like to know how to make decent coffee using a drip (pour over) coffee.</p>

  <p>How much: Most pourover drippers work best when they're between one
  half to two-thirds full of coffee grounds. Any less than that, and
  there won't be enough coffee to restrict the flow. Any more, and your
  dripper may overflow. You'll also want to make sure you're dripping
  into a large enough vessel. If you're the more precise-measurement
  type, a good coffee-to-water ratio is between 60-70 grams of coffee
  per liter of water (a mass ratio between 1:16 and 1:14.)</p>
  
  <ol start=""2"">
  <li><p>Get your clean (filtered if you need it) brew water ready. You'll be using water that's about 30 seconds off boil if you're pouring
  straight out of your boiling kettle, or immediately off boil if you're
  pouring into a second pouring kettle. I like about 207°F for medium to
  light roasts, and about 10° lower for dark roasts.</p></li>
  <li><p>Start your clock and add enough water to soak all of the coffee (a little premature dripping is okay). Wait for the coffee bed to stop
  the initial swelling (about 30 seconds) before adding more water.</p></li>
  <li><p>Continue your brew. Try to pour quickly, gently, and evenly across the surface of the coffee, pausing between pours to pace your brew to
  your target brew time (see below). The distance that your brew water
  drops can affect brew temperatures, as well as increase or decrease
  the amount of agitation that the falling water creates wherever it
  falls in the coffee bed. In general, the lower you pour from, the
  better, if for no other reason than it's the easiest to create and
  maintain consistency.</p></li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>When you stop adding water, your dripper will continue to drip for
  between 20 and 60 seconds.</p>
  
  <p>Your target total brew time is about 2.5 to 3 minutes for dark roasted
  coffee, and 3 to 4 minutes for medium to light roasted coffees. This
  includes the dripping time after you stop adding water.</p>

"<p>I highly recommend anyone looking at a pour over to take a look at the <a href=""https://www.sweetmarias.com/clevercoffeedripperpictorial.php"" rel=""nofollow"">Clever Dripper.</a>  It's a pour over brewer with a plate at the bottom that restricts flow unless the unit is resting on a cup.  You can use it as a regular pour over or you can use it off a cup to steep your coffee.  It allows all the control of a press and the grounds free cup of a paper filter.</p>

<p>To answer your question, it depends on how you like your coffee.  Grind finer and/or pour slower and you will get a stronger cup of coffee.  Grind courser and pour more quickly and you will get a weaker cup of coffee.  Pouring from the center sometime results in a raised edge around the rim, which isn't ideal when I am trying to fill the cone as full as possible, but in a true pour over, may be fine.  Pouring from the side seems to sometimes result in a small island of dry grounds floating in the middle of the cone.  For that reason, I generally vary my pour around the cone to minimize either effect and then stir some for good measure.</p>
"
"<p>It'll be best to take a multi-faceted approach, there are some things you can do that don't require a significant monetary investment, but it will cost you a bit of time in the name of science. </p>

<p>First, try having decent filtered water delivered, and use that to fill the machine. I know that it sounds trivial, but the quality of water can affect how <em>any</em> coffee tastes. It can render your espresso tart, or turn your Folgers into mud pie soup. This should also result in less build up of 'gunk' in your machine.</p>

<p>Second, eliminate your filters as a cause of bad taste. To do this, heat some water to about 95 degrees Celsius, pour it through a few of the filters and into a container to cool. Wait for it to cool, smell and taste the water. Any after taste or odor? You got it from the filters, change your brand. While it's not <em>always</em> true, the more expensive the filter, the better the chance that it's not going to shed fibers or tastes into your brew.</p>

<p>Third, have your machine cleaned. Ask any diner who does it for them, and take it to wherever that is. Stuff can build up that a simple cleaning can't handle, the machine should be broken down and cleaned thoroughly, especially if you're getting that vegemite-like 'burnt'  taste to things. </p>

<p>Finally, if Maxwell House is the coffee everyone can agree on, try putting a pinch of kosher salt in the basket with the grinds before you brew - it can <em>really</em> help to bring out latent flavors that might still be in the beans (provided that the coffee is still reasonably fresh), it won't make the coffee taste salty. Not much, 10 crystals or less, but try adding a pinch. </p>

<p>I think pound for pound, you'll get the most out of:</p>

<ul>
<li>Having the machine professionally cleaned</li>
<li>Having better water delivered, and using that to brew</li>
<li>Tossing a few crystals of kosher salt in with the grinds</li>
</ul>

<p>The machine you've got is a classic workhorse, and I'm sure it's got plenty of get-up-and-go left, but it does need to be maintained periodically.</p>

"<p>After roasting, the beans colour is usually uneven. Most of the beans have the desired roast, but some are burnt, and some have visibly lighter colours.</p>

"<p>Sorting done during the processing phase of coffee production (prior to roasting) is done in many places and can produce <a href=""http://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/264/peaberry-and-coffee-varieties"">lots of coffee that look very different, but taste almost exactly the same.</a>  Peaberry beans may be sorted out (mostly by sight from what I understand) and sold as separate lots.  Additionally size may be used and beans can be sorted with screens (slightly more automated) to produce lots that appear more consistent in size.  While these things may affect appearance, they are not thought to affect taste (by most) and so all of these will likely be sold.  However, during these same processes, any truly ""bad"" beans (moldy, unformed, etc) will probably be removed and discarded.  If buyers see significant amounts of bad beans in a lot, it will be assumed that care was not taken in the processing of the coffee.</p>

<p>I roast at home and the only time I have ever ""sorted"" is if a bean or two from a previous batch was hidden in my drum and gets BBB'd (burnt beyond belief) in a second roasting process.  Depending on roasting process, there is always a range of time that the beans get to certain points, they don't all hit first crack or second crack at the same time.  If the beans are of sufficient quality and properly sorted after processing (at the source/origin) those ranges will be fairly narrow with not a lot of overlap.  The machine I have now does a fairly good job or mixing the beans during roasting and the roasts I get from it are quite consistent.  If I roast at a lower temperature longer, usually even more so.</p>

<p>To answer your question, the higher the quality of green beans and the better the roast technique, the less the need for sorting (if any).  I can hardly see any reason for sorting beans for size/shape after the roasting process.  Roasted coffee should be stored in opaque packaging, and any efforts to unify appearance would be nullified by proper storage.  If there is so much variation in the roast that it needs sorting for flavor, I would suggest that time might be better spent refining the roasting process for consistency.</p>

"<p>The gases themselves are largely composed of CO2 and moisture trapped in the grinds. My understanding is that releasing the gases ahead of time prevent the gasses from interfering with an even extraction throughout the brewing process.</p>

<p>As when brewing coffee, we're trying to expose the grounds evenly to the hot water, the release of gas fights against this, causing channeling or uneven extraction. This can affect your flavor profile by overextracting some of the coffee, and not extracting enough from the rest.</p>

<p>From my own experience, fresher, better-quality coffees tend to produce more gasses. I would imagine this being because the gasses escape on their own over time from the coffee when it's just sitting around.</p>

"<p>This is more of a vague feeling than something I'm sure of, but from the many cups I've drunk, I have a feeling that <strong>when prepared in a french press, my coffee tastes a little more sour/acidic, compared to a turkish brew. Is this a documented phenomenon</strong>, or is it just me? </p>

<p>Of course, assume the same coffee is used both times, which by the way is some home-ground (blade grinder) arabica.</p>
"
"<p>It will affect the flavor. Whether that's particularly noticeable depends on the bean, the roast you're going for, and how <em>much</em> variance there is in the roast. Whether it <em>matters</em> to you is a personal decision. </p>

<p>In my experience, over-roasted beans are worth removing from a light roast (I tend to prefer city roast at darkest), even if they're not actually <em>burnt</em> - the flavor of even a few dark beans will tend to overwhelm the more delicate flavors of a lighter roast. </p>

<p>That said, I use a popcorn popper; there tends to be a lot of variation in the results. If you have a better roasting setup, you can probably avoid a lot of the hassle. </p>

"<p>According <a href=""http://www.livestrong.com/article/543945-acid-levels-caffeinated-vs-decaf-coffee/"" rel=""nofollow"">this source</a>, a study by Dionex, a part of Thermo Fisher Scientific, found that decaf coffee is <strong>less acidic</strong> than regular coffee.</p>

<p>That being said, all coffee causes the stomach to produce acid and the scientific results of the effect of both types of coffee on this are inconclusive. Some studies have found that patients drinking decaf have less stomach acid issues and vice versa.</p>

<p>According to <a href=""http://teeccino.com/images/uploads/pages/File/DECAF.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">this source</a>, the nature of the beans used to make decaf coffee are higher in acidity in any case, because these beans are used due to their ability to retain flavor after treatment.</p>

<p>All in all, decaffeinated coffee beans have less acid in them than their counterparts, but because the choice beans for decaffeination are already high in acid, this may make most decaf coffees have a higher acidic content in general when compared to other coffees.</p>

"<p>As an American, I've never heard of a long black, but it sounds like a great idea. I normally drink brewed coffee black, but I enjoy an occasional Americano. The only problem is that they're generally served around 400,000° and I can barely hold them and have to wait hours for them to cool down enough to drink. Sometimes I ask for ice or something to cool it quickly. If I just wait for it to cool, it tends to taste rather old and stale by the time I can handle it. Or maybe I just can't taste it because my tongue is crispy from preliminary attempts. But the crema and freshness is always long gone.</p>

<p>I think that must secretly be the real reason for a long black—by adding the espresso to the top of drinkable-temperature water, you still have a chance at the best flavors and aromas. As <a href=""http://www.fivesenses.com.au/blog/2011/12/19/the-espresso-menu-explained"" rel=""nofollow"">the Australian coffee roasters Five Senses put it,</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Regardless of the crema, the long black tastes best as it cools slightly from boiling to a drinkable temperature. Only then will you be able to perceive some of the finer nuances and sweetness of the coffee.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, I would shoot to <strong>have the cup around the same temperature as good brewed coffee by the time it hits the drinker's lips</strong>. According to <a href=""http://www.coffeedetective.com/what-is-the-correct-temperature-for-serving-coffee.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Coffee Detective,</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[American-style brewed] coffee is best served at a temperature between 155ºF and 175ºF (70ºC to 80ºC). Most people prefer it towards the higher end, at about 175ºF.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That means, depending on cup type and ambient temperature, if you draw 200°F hot water from the machine before you start making the espresso and leave it uncovered, it will be roughly the right temperature to serve by the time the shots are ready.</p>

  positive control. After performing the gross behavioral study, the
  Antibacterial activity was evaluated against Gram
  - negative bacteria included; Escherichia coli , Proteus mirabilis , Klebsiella pneumonia and Pseudomonas aeruginosa Both compounds at a
  concentration of 2 mg/ml showed similar anti bacterial activities
  against all tested bacteria, except for P. mirabilis , and the highest
  inhibitory effect was observed against P. aeruginosa using a modified
  agar diffusion method. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of
  caffeine was determined us ing a broth microdilution method in 96

  250.0 μ g/ml for the caffeine isolated from coffee and 65.5 to 500.0 μ g/ml for green tea caffeine. Combination results showed additive
  effects against most p athogenic bacteria especially for P.

"<p>At least in the US (and probably elsewhere), late-night diners are a popular place to get a cheap cup of joe. In my experience, diner coffee has a taste that's generally not found elsewhere (most people call it ""bad"", but that's not what this question is about).</p>

<p>I'm wondering what causes this taste, and how they all get such similar tasting coffee? I assume the brewing process has something to do with it (those big commercial drip brewers which they all seem to use), but I've been to other places that used those with various different roasts and they all tasted different.</p>

<p>So what else makes diner coffee taste like diner coffee? Examples of the kinds of places that serve this include chains like Waffle House, but also individual / locally owned diners.</p>
"
"<p>I think it is a combination of old stale grounds sitting on a burner for long hours. The places you mention are generally open 24/7 or something close to it and have people ordering coffee at all times of day, so it's all made ahead of time and kept warm all day.</p>

<p>The cheapest coffee suppliers usually mix beans from all over the place and they all store them way past any freshness date. Diners run on small budgets and generally buy the cheapest stuff, thus they all have the same ""flavor"".</p>

<p>That combination is not just a diner thing, I would also say it is the same as cheap gas station coffee in the US.</p>

<p>I would knock it more if it didn't keep me awake behind the wheel more than a few times.</p>

"<p>I know that as much of our perception of flavour is down to smell as actual taste. When I get a take-out coffee with a lid, am I losing all of the smell that I would get if I drank it out of an open-topped vessel, and does this affect the taste?</p>

<p>To get the full taste should I remove the lid before drinking it?</p>

<hr>

<p>So there are a <a href=""https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&amp;q=coffee+alzheimers&amp;btnG=&amp;as_sdt=1%2C5&amp;as_sdtp="" rel=""nofollow"">whole bunch</a> of studies that have been done that have investigated a potential link between coffee consumption and Alzheimers.</p>

<p>The problem, as always, is that these types of '<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"" rel=""nofollow"">cohort studies</a>' are really difficult. Basically the way it works is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Get a load of volunteers</li>
<li>By doing questionnaires, work out everything about them</li>
<li>Track them over a long period of time</li>
<li>See if there's a statistically significant link between combinations of behaviours (such as drinking coffee) and a particular outcome (diagnosis of Alzheimers) </li>
</ul>

<p>All the standard stuff applies here: you are not testing for <em>causation</em>, only for <em>correlation</em>. For example, ~80% of Americans drink coffee, but in other cultures this number varies a lot. If the coffee drinkers in your study are predominantly American, and the non-coffee drinkers are predominantly not, you have a whole bunch of confounding factors. Designing your study to avoid this kind of situation is really hard, especially when you're relying on volunteers.</p>

<p>There's also the issue of what exactly are you measuring? Someone might drink 3 cups a day now, but only has done for the past few years. Another person might drink 2 cups a day, but has done their whole life. Another person might drink 2 cups of decaff a day. Questionnaires are usually not sophisticated enough to capture this level of detail (partly because in your big expensive study you want to capture as much information about different behaviours as possible - not just coffee consumption).</p>

<p>Remember also that medical studies are <em>chronically</em> badly reported in the mainstream press. Even in 'high-brow' publications, by the time the headline-writers get their hands on a study, the message can have changed <em>wildly</em>. It's always worth trying to dig up the actual paper whenever new research is mentioned in the news. If no paper is linked, just ignore the headline.</p>

<p>One tool against all of this uncertainty is <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_analysis"" rel=""nofollow"">meta-analysis</a>. This is where you look at every single study, weighted by how confident you are in the data (e.g. by weighting more to studies with more participants, and better questionnaires etc.). You then do some careful statistics work to get a measure of confidence across all of the studies. Think of it as a sophisticated way of 'averaging them out'.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.maneyonline.com/doi/abs/10.1179/174313206X152546"" rel=""nofollow"">One of these was done</a> in 2002. Only 4 studies had been done by then, but the conclusion was:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Although our pooled estimates show that coffee consumption is inversely associated with the risk of AD, the four studies had heterogeneous methodologies and results. Further prospective studies evaluating the association between coffee consumption and AD are strongly needed.</p>

"<p>Simple observation: Whenever I shifted to <em>better</em> coffee, I always had to pay a little bit extra for coffee itself than usual.</p>

"
"<p>Short answer: <strong>Yes</strong> - up to a point</p>

<p>Long answer: </p>

<p>Ignoring things like Kopi Luwak etc, there is a cost associated with growing, harvesting and transporting arabica beans in a timely manner, roasting them while they're fresh, and getting them to somewhere you can buy them.</p>

<p>If you go below this price, corners will be cut. You may get cheaper robusta beans, or a mix. You will get older, staler beans. You will get the poor end of the harvest.</p>

<p>However, go above that price and you're needlessly spending extra cash. You're now spending on marketing for the people you're buying it from. You're paying for a fancier bag, better branding etc. This may actually make it taste bette - <a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0148296382900418"">psychology is a powerful thing</a>, but the beans you're getting won't be significantly different.</p>

<p>The problem is, this magic price-point is impossible to find, fluctuates wildly, and it's in the interests of suppliers to obfusticate it as much as possible.</p>

<p>My advice would be to try a variety of coffees that you can afford and find one you like. </p>
"
"<p>Comments on the question above, but I'd expand this as an answer as well because I don't see it mentioned yet.</p>

<p>Another possibility of ""diner coffee taste"" could be due to the use of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robusta_coffee"">robusta</a> rather than <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffea_arabica"">arabica</a>. Robusta tends to be cheaper than arabica, so this might also be a reason for its use (and the cited ""cheapness"") of the cup. If you're used to fancy cafe coffee (which tends to be arabica), it's a rather different (albeit not necessarily unpleasant) experience. See also <a href=""http://coffee.stackexchange.com/q/116/262"">this question on arabica and robusta</a>.</p>

<p>Granted, this arabica/robusta distinction is oversimplification, because there are so many varietals, but here's <a href=""http://www.thekitchn.com/coffee-basics-the-difference-b-41949"">one article</a> on differences. For example, robusta tends to have lower acidity, but higher bitterness. If these are the attributes you attribute, it might be further robusta evidence.</p>

<p>If you were to learn the brand of coffee being brewed, that might suggest the variety of the beans, but that's probably difficult to learn from generic, anonymous diners.</p>
"
"<p>I have found that like almost all purchased products, you generally get what you pay for.  More expensive is usually better, but not always directly in line with the price.  </p>

<p>Things that are stand out more expensive than their contemporaries (Kopi Luwak, many Kona coffees, and currently Gesha varietals) are often very good, but not necessarily as good as their price tag.  I wouldn't say any Kona or Gesha coffee is 4 times better than the South and Central Americans I prefer, but because of real estate and labor prices for Kona, and the current ""rush"" popularity of gesha, they are that much more expensive.  </p>

<p>Many people don't think about the cost of things like getting organic or fair trade certified.  Those things cost money for growers/processors to obtain, and that price is passed on.  If you care very much about such things, however, it may make a lot of sense to pay $1 more a pound for your coffee.  Even though the bag right next to it may be of the exact same quality for less money, it doesn't support your beliefs/ideals/principles.</p>
"
"<p>Yes.  You should remove the lid for maximum effect.  Somewhere around <a href=""http://dwb.unl.edu/teacher/nsf/C10/C10Links/ericir.syr.edu/Projects/Newton/11/tstesmll.html"">three quarters of our perception of taste comes from smell</a>.  There are varying figures out there, but most are fairly high.  </p>

<p>However, much of that comes from the olfactory sense when the molecules pass from our mouth to our sinuses.  So, having a stuffy nose is more likely to reduce the taste of your coffee than drinking it with the lid on.  That being said, the aroma from brewed coffee tends to dissipate fairly quickly, so you might only need to leave the lid off your cup for the first few minutes of your ""coffee experience"". </p>
"
"<p>Well, I've heard a lot of ""pro tips"" and advice having worked around espresso machines for a few years. And I must say, this one is new. I have never heard of warming the coffee itself. I can't imagine that, at the temperature at which the brew head usually resides, many significant changes are made in just a few moments of warming the coffee.</p>

<p>The closest I've heard to this is that some believe in the opposite. A fellow once told me to leave my spent puck in the portafilter if someone was going to be brewing again shortly. He claimed this helped retain heat in the portafilter. Though the science checks out, the results proved marginal and pretty much just made you the lazy guy using the espresso machine.</p>

<p>So, in closing, I'd say that the effects of warming your coffee are probably negligible, and that you can get more crema more easily through other means (buying better quality coffee, adjusting your brewing variables, etc)</p>

Measure the amount of coffee and water you need for a regular hot french press brew, but instead use cold or room temperature water.  Leave the press pot in a refrigerator overnight or at room temperature, push the plunger down in the morning, and you'll have delicious cold brew ready.</p>

<p>You can also buy cold brew systems.  I've never used it, but I heard this works pretty well.  <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B0006H0JVW"">http://www.amazon.com/Toddy-T2N-Cold-Brew-System/dp/B0006H0JVW</a></p>

"<p>When making a Caffe Americano, does it matter whether you put the hot water or espresso in first?  This is not a complicated drink to make, but I've seen it prepared both ways.</p>

<p>If it does matter, why does the order affect the taste of the coffee?</p>
"
"<p>There are two ways to start with: plunging and dripping.</p>

<ul>
<li>Plunging is to mix water with ground coffee, and let the mix sleep slowly.</li>
<li>Dripping is the same as classical hot-water dripping, except the speed is much slower.</li>
</ul>

<p>The slowly / ""much slower"" part means about 8-12 hours, depending on the quantity of ground. For example, I use 400mL/14oz and 40g/1.5oz of ground on an 8 hour drip.</p>

<p>The beans should be quite finely ground, as cold water does not penetrate the ground as well as hot water.</p>

<p>@henryJ exposed plunging in detail. As for dripping, it is possible to use a standard filter stand and paper filter.</p>

<p>The hard part is to drip water slowly. There are cheap devices on the market. An alternative is to get one of those flasks used in chemistry class (a new one, never try with a used one---chemistry is scary). The cheapest way is probably to get an empty plastic bottle, put the cap on, use a needle to make a tiny hole in the cap, fix the bottle upside down above the ground to start dripping. The goal is for the water to pour drop by drop, at a rate of about 1 drop every couple seconds.</p>
"
"<p>Yes.  Adding water to Espresso is considered an <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caff%C3%A8_Americano"">Americano</a>.  Doing it the other way around is called a Long Black.</p>

<p>According to that article and below sources, the Long Black preserves the crema, whereas the Americano preparation should not.  The manner in which the pour is done can contribute more to preserving or destroying the crema than the order.  An Americano should have no crema and the crema should be preserved in a Long Black.  It is the preservation or destruction of the crema that will affect the taste (and thus the pour) more than the order.</p>

"<p>Dictionaries seem to agree that brewing requires <em>hot</em> water. I have checked definitions in the <em>New Oxford American Dictionary</em>, the (British) <em>Oxford Dictionary of English</em>, and a thesaurus.</p>

<p>So how about the expression we most use for getting a coffee drink out of cold water: ""cold brew"" ?</p>
"
"<p>Yes, the term is an oxymoron.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/brew"">Miriam Webster</a> agrees with your definition of brewing involving hot water:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>to prepare (as tea) by infusion in hot water</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is why the word <em>cold</em> is used as a qualifier to show that it is done with cold water rather than hot water.</p>
"
"<p>Here is what I found:</p>

<ul>
<li>Trying to tear out a proper filter is difficult. Filters do resist to boiling-water temperature.</li>
<li>Trying to tear out a proper filter <em>along the seam</em> is quite easy.</li>
</ul>

<p>So, by folding the filter on the seam, it seems we kind of hide the seam from direct contact with hot water. The seam glue is <em>not</em> weak these days, but this way there is no risk of tearing (e.g. if there is a defect in the seam), and the surface area inside the filter is also more uniform---the filter stands well in place.</p>

<p>There is a seam in the first place, because it is easy to manufacture fold-able filters this way (I am looking for a citation here).</p>

"<p>What is the difference between a long (luongo) and a short (ristretto) shot of espresso?</p>

<p>Is there a difference in grind, extraction time, amount of coffee used, temperature, volume of water?</p>

<p>If so, what are the differences?</p>
"
"<p>A long (luongo) and a short (ristretto) shot have two key differences.</p>

<p>The amount of coffee used virtually stays the same although it can increase slightly with a ristretto shot, as the grind is finer.</p>

<p>The key similarity between these two shots and a normal shot is that the <strong>extraction time stays the same</strong>. <em>The grind is altered</em> to achieve this - coarser for a long shot and finer for a ristretto shot.  This, ideally, alters the volume of water which can pass through the coffee.</p>

<p>For a long shot, the volume should be <strong>twice</strong> that of a standard espresso shot and for a ristretto shot, the volume should be <strong>half</strong> that of a standard espresso shot.</p>

<p>The temperature of the water remains the same.</p>

"<p>In my experience, it is difficult to achieve perfect microfoam with a home brewing espresso machine.</p>

<p>Essentially what you need is a <strong>15 bar pump</strong> and a <strong>boiler chamber big enough</strong> to hold enough steam to have higher pressure and volumes of steam.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this usually means you need to buy a bigger espresso machine which means it is going to be a bit more pricey.</p>

<p>Since manufacturers don't always give technical specifications on what size boilers they use, you may have to rely on customer reviews for this aspect. They should always give the strength of the pump though.</p>

<p>In my own personal experience, the smallest espresso machine with which I have been able to achieve perfect microfoam <a href=""http://www.idrinkcoffee.com/Breville_Professional_800_Collection_BES800ES_Espr_p/sa-bre-800es-b5.htm?gclid=CLj7q7qS1sMCFYNAaQodm4MACw"">is this</a>. However, I was professionally trained in a coffee shop for two years using an industrial machine.  For you, I might recommend that you go up a size or two. Breville is an excellent brand and has good machines that make good foam.</p>

<p>Aside from that, you do want a 360 degree rotational steam wand so you can control your milk. Also, you want your steam wand to just be plain and simple and not have one of those 'frothing helpers' for beginners. Most come with it but are removable. You will need to learn how to control air injection on your own.</p>

"<p>I've heard that coffee can raise your cholesterol. If that's true, is it a bad thing? Is regular or acute exposure to coffee dangerous in this way?</p>
"
"<p>Coffee beans contain a chemical called <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cafestol"" rel=""nofollow"">cafestol</a>, which tends to increase blood cholesterol levels, especially LDL (""bad"") cholesterol.</p>

<p>Brewing with a paper filter seems to reduce the levels of these cholesterol-raising chemicals in brewed coffee by filtering out these chemicals (e.g., cafestol, kahweol). Levels of cafestol in coffee are higher in non-paper-filtered brewing methods, such as French press and others.</p>

<p>Here's <a href=""http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/coffee/"" rel=""nofollow"">one article</a> that discusses this, and <a href=""http://www.nbcnews.com/id/6242467/ns/health-heart_health/t/coffee-cholesterol"" rel=""nofollow"">another pointed out by @apaul34208</a> in comments.</p>

"<p>What's the difference between a percolator and a moka pot?  For example, differences in the device itself, the method of use, and the resulting brew?

<p><a href=""http://coffee.stackexchange.com/q/97/262"">This question</a> seems to suggest they are synonymous. Are there regional differences in use of these terms?</p>
"
"<p>A <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moka_pot"" rel=""nofollow"">moka pot</a> is what some call a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espresso_machine#Stove_top"" rel=""nofollow"">stovetop espresso maker</a>; I find this to be a bit of a misnomer, because the result is rather different than proper espresso. Water is put into a bottom vessel; coffee grounds are placed on a perforated platform with attached cone, which is placed on/in the water vessel; a top holding tank with rubber gasket is screwed on top of the apparatus. The device is placed over a heat source, boiling the water;  the boiling water creates steam and pressure, which forces water through the grounds into the upper storage vessel.  The two chambers are separate, so the water is forced through the grounds once (upward). Somewhat similar to espresso, a moka pot develops some small amount of pressure to force (nearly boiling) water through grounds, though the pressure is much less than espresso (see also <a href=""http://coffee.stackexchange.com/a/298/262"">this answer</a>). I don't think the grounds are meant to be tamped like espresso, either.</p>

<p>A <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_percolator"" rel=""nofollow"">percolator</a> boils water and drips it over grounds continuously.  There is no separate storage vessel for the coffee once brewed; water (at first) or (partially-brewed) coffee is continuously boiled (passing up to the top of the chamber through a funnel/straw) and dripped over the grounds (which are instead at the top of the chamber, rather than in the middle as in the moka pot).  The brewed coffee ends up in the same place the plain water was at the beginning of the brew. Percolators often have a clever little clear cap in the middle of the top, so you can see when the brewing is occurring, and color of the brewed coffee.</p>

<p>I have both devices, and use them differently; e.g., a coarser grind for percolator.  I find the outcome of percolated coffee to be more like French press or perhaps drip; moka is more like Turkish coffee or espresso. Though similar in concept (stovetop coffee production devices), they're (to me) totally different in outcome.</p>

<p>I suspect, but I don't know, if there are regional differences in these terms.</p>

<p>Full disclosure: this <a href=""http://meta.coffee.stackexchange.com/q/60/262"">meta question</a> and <a href=""http://meta.coffee.stackexchange.com/a/74/262"">my answer</a> prompted this adaptation as a clarification question.</p>
"
"<p>Here comes an unintentionally snarky answer:</p>

<p>Flavored coffee and high quality coffee are rarely synonymous. Since flavored coffee masks the organic and natural flavors of the coffee itself, it's rare that a quality bean is used in the first place. Imagine ordering a <a href=""https://www.masterofmalt.com/whiskies/the-glenlivet-18-year-old-whisky/"" rel=""nofollow"">Glenlivet 18</a> with Pepsi.</p>

<p>Ergo, I'd say that your brew temperature with a flavored coffee isn't extremely important. In the end, you're really just going to be tasting artificial (natural if you're <em>lucky</em>) flavors that cover up the taste of the bad coffee underneath.</p>

<p>What I would say, however, is before you start using quality coffee after using flavored coffee, be sure to clean your equipment thoroughly. The flavors used in those coffees have a tendency to stick around long after they're gone.</p>
"
"<p>Assuming the perfect grind, you are looking for extraction time and volume.</p>

<p>The ideal double shot should be <strong>60 mL</strong> (about 2 US fluid ounces) and should be extracted between <strong>20-30 seconds</strong>.</p>

<p>I use the double shot as the example because it is considered to be the standard.</p>

<p>So essentially, pull a double shot until 60 mL or 2 ounces comes out. You can use something to measure this volume like a graduated shot glass. Time how long this takes. I always aim for 20 seconds. If it is faster than 20 seconds, then you need to make your grind slightly finer. If it is slower than this, then you need to make the grind slightly coarser.</p>

<p>Then modify to your taste! If you like the way it tastes when it takes 30 seconds, then drink away and enjoy. If you prefer 20 seconds, then enjoy that!</p>

<p>Half these values for a single shot.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Some people will argue that a double shot should be 40 mL and not 60 mL. This is also about preference.</p>
"
"<p>I generally judge when to stop my shot based off when blonding begins to occur. This is when the espresso changes to a noticeably lighter, yellowish color. At this stage, only bitter flavors are being extracted from the coffee, and any more extraction will only degrade the flavor of your shot.</p>

<p>It takes a bit of practice to notice blonding, and can be made more obvious by using a bottomless portafilter. I also suggest using a stopwatch to determine how long it takes before blonding occurs, so you can see how consistent the rest of your process is. </p>
"
"<p>Excellent description and answers already (upvotes all around...); here's another take and some links to external resources and experimentation.</p>

<p>I use the ""plunging"" method, mixing grounds directly with water, as described in other answers by @henryJ and @Eric. I find that the outcome of brewing, then filtering via French press, is too gritty or grainy, far more so than the store-bought stuff (which might be slow-drip, but I don't know how it's done on a production scale).</p>

<p>Filtering that result through a conventional coffee filter (e.g., <a href=""http://www.rachaelraymag.com/blogs/rachael-ray/2013/07/25/how-to-make-cold-brew-coffee/"" rel=""nofollow"">like this</a>) takes a <em>long</em> time -- on the order of hours for some reasonable quantity of coffee. I don't know exactly why, but I attribute this to the longer brew resulting in more stuff that clogs the paper filter; this clogging seems to happen no matter how coarsely I grind the coffee. (I'd be happy to hear suggestions about that, though; doesn't seem enough for a question...)</p>

<p>I use a multi-step filtering process, putting the coffee through a few passes of cheesecloth or other cloth to hopefully filter out the bigger chunks first, but this is messy (hard to clean up) and seems wasteful. </p>

<p>Here's a few other techniques with similarly absurd steps to filter the coffee during or after brewing.  Both are steeping in the style of a tea bag, with the grounds wrapped in a sack.</p>

<li>using <a href=""http://www.instructables.com/id/DIY-Cold-Brew-Coffee/"" rel=""nofollow"">felt fabric</a> after steeping in a paper basket filter;</li>

"<p>Obviously, differencies in a bunch of parameters yield variance in flavour and acidity? This is not only temperature, but also time (from the rapid espresso to Cezve to all-nighter cold brews), amount and grind.</p>

<p>There are quite a few discussions dedicated to some of them (<a href=""http://coffee.stackexchange.com/q/16/277"">temperature</a>, <a href=""http://coffee.stackexchange.com/q/3/277"">water hardness</a>, time for <a href=""http://coffee.stackexchange.com/q/415/277"">espresso</a> and <a href=""http://coffee.stackexchange.com/q/297/277"">french press</a>, and even <a href=""http://coffee.stackexchange.com/q/385/277"">the cup</a>).</p>

<p>I wonder if there are any interesting ways for them to interact. For instance, a coarser ground would take more time to get the result. Which other things can or cannot be rescued in this fashion? Say, get rich aroma if I only have light roast beans, etc.</p>

<p>I imagine that there is no short or definitive answer, but any ideas are appreciated!</p>

"<p>I like to make a coffee with soya milk. Sometimes when I add the milk to the coffee, it curdles. ie it separates into lumps floating in translucent liquid. So this tastes and looks a bit strange (but is still drinkable).</p>

<p>So how to prevent this from happening? Does it depend on the type of coffee, or the type of soya milk? Or how and when they are mixed together?</p>
"
"<p>Well actually, it depends on how hot your coffee is, not the type of coffee. The acidity in black coffee is higher than the acidity in soy milk, though, and it can act like a coagulant, making like loose tofu in your cup of coffee. The heat of your soy milk can actually <strong><em>HELP</em></strong> curdle the soy milk even more, rather than preventing it. In this <a href=""http://www.thekitchn.com/why-does-soymilk-curdle-in-hot-148329"" rel=""nofollow"">food science website</a>, which contains the info I gave, it says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It seems like the best way to prevent curdling is to warm the soy milk slowly by pouring it into the cup first, then gradually add the coffee. Letting the coffee cool a bit before adding soy milk and avoiding more acidic coffee beans may also help.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This should answer your questions and prevent the curdling in your coffee. I hope this helps you!</p>
"
"<p>These two things are clearly not the same. Here are my reasons:</p>

<p>Moka pots - They use small amounts of pressurized water flowing through the coffee grind to make a fine stovetop espresso. The brewing process is relatively cheap and nearly uses the same amount of pressure as a actual espresso machine. You could even call them just mini espresso machines if you wanted to.</p>

<p>On the other hand...</p>

<p>Percolators - These objects that resemble tall, thinner tea pots make cups of coffee with the high heat and lengthy steeping process. Steeping might not really the word here but here is how they do it:
The percolator heats the water from the bottom to create steam. The steam goes up then comes down (kind of like condensation), making coffee at the bottom of the percolator. The coffee slowly strengthens as the process continues. Flavors may vary...</p>

<p>In conclusion, they as in percolators and moka pots are different. Percolators are mainly used to make straight coffee while moka pots make espresso. Their ways of making coffee is different too, and also goes to the flavors. Here is my <a href=""http://www.stovpreso.com/2013/08/is-moka-pot-same-thing-as-percolator.html"" rel=""nofollow"">source</a>. I hope this helps you!  </p>

"<p>When I make coffee in a Cezve, I like to preheat milk. I have an impression that it affects taste beyond just not making the resulting drink colder. It seems that the resulting flavour is fuller-bodied.</p>

<p>Another thing, I like to pour coffee over milk, not the other way around.</p>

<p>And my question is, can there be something behind this, or is it just subjective delusions?</p>
"
"<p>It seems that <em>the cause</em> of the situation of curdling soya milk in coffee is that the acid from the coffee curldes the proteins and/or fats in the (soya or other) milk, being catalysed by the heat of the coffee; so that's what needs to be mitigated.</p>

<p>There are a couple related questions on <a href=""http://cooking.stackexchange.com"">Cooking.SE</a>, including <a href=""http://cooking.stackexchange.com/q/30060/25286"">this one</a> that suggests <strong>adding salt to the coffee will help a little</strong> (table salt, or even bicarb / baking soda). I have tried adding table salt to the coffee first, then adding the coffee to the soya milk, and it seems to help (a little, sometimes; YMMV). <a href=""http://cooking.stackexchange.com/q/28179/25286"">Another Cooking.SE question</a> also suggests waiting for coffee to cool. </p>

<p>The linked TheKitchn article (linked from the aforementioned previous question and @PythonMaster's answer) suggests that cooling the coffee, or pouring coffee <em>into</em> the soya milk (rather than the other way around) helps via similar mechanisms. In my experience in messing with this, <strong>I have not found the order of adding ingredients makes much difference</strong> (i.e., putting coffee into the soya milk). <strong>It absolutely depends on the type of coffee</strong>, also, because <a href=""http://www.highergroundstrading.com/blog/38/coffee-acidity:-the-science-and-the-experience--"" rel=""nofollow"">different coffees will have different degrees of acidity</a>.  See also <a href=""http://www.highlandcoffeesbr.com/coffeeprofileschart.php"" rel=""nofollow"">this table</a> about relative acidity levels.</p>

<p>However, it is certainly the case that <strong>adding coffee into the milk will be helpful in general</strong> (compare also to <a href=""http://cooking.stackexchange.com/q/4208/25286"">tempering of eggs</a> or adding acid <em>into</em> water rather than the other way around).  In this order, these allow temperature and acid (respectively) to more slowly come into balance between the two substances as they are being combined.</p>

<p>IMHO, I have found <em>the brand</em> (i.e., the ingredients and production methods) of the soya milk to be the biggest factor. I (personally, with not-entirely-scientific -- yet! -- trials) find that <strong>soya milk brands that contain emulsifiers (or other additives) are less likely to curdle in coffee</strong>.  My only guesses are that </p>

<ul>
<li>these compounds (emulsifiers, thickeners, or stabilisers, such as <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrageenan"" rel=""nofollow"">carrageenan</a> or <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xanthan_gum"" rel=""nofollow"">xanthan gum</a>) interfere with the coagulation, or</li>
<li>something else in the processing (perhaps, e.g., pasteurisation) has denatured the proteins or otherwise chemically changed the nutrients such that they are less likely (cf., UHT or ultra-pasteurised milk)</li>
</ul>

<p>I generally prefer to avoid the additives, so this is an unfortunate conclusion for me personally.</p>

<p>Freshness of the milk is also an issue; milk of all types will spoil and slowly start to curdle due to natural processes (fermentation, bacteria, other contamination). There's another question <a href=""http://cooking.stackexchange.com/q/45476/25286"">about storing soya milk in the freezer</a>, where we reached similar conclusions.</p>

<p>At the risk of making this an even longer answer, here are some other things to try:</p>

<ul>
<li>Add <em>cold coffee</em> into soya milk.  Does it curdle?  If so, it seems temperature is not your only enemy.</li>
<li>Check your label; does it have carrageenan or so?  If so, this might not be the metaphorical silver bullet.</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm interested (fascinated, even; obsessed, maybe?:) ) with this, so I'd really like to hear feedback. Of the dozens of articles I've read on this, I've still not found a proper solution.</p>

"<h2>Use a tea <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infuser"">infuser</a>!</h2>

<p>I got a tea infuser with a very fine mesh and put my grounds in that. It holds fewer grounds than I used with the ""raw"" plunge, but it's much more pleasant to use: I just pluck the floating infuser out of the pitcher and empty the grounds from it. I may get a second filter, or a larger one, but for now I'm content making coffee more often because it's less of a chore each time.</p>

<p>There's no visible particulate in the resulting drink, though if I run the brew through a filter (which is a heckuva lot faster, as there's no clogging of grounds at all!) it comes out with a small amount of lint-like residue. And the last cup in the pitcher is much stronger than it used to be, but I'm not exactly complaining about that.</p>

<p>You could also go for an intermediate approach, using a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tea_strainer"">tea strainer</a> before you run the brew through a regular filter: that'll get the big stuff out fast so your filtering doesn't slow down. (Also, put a teaspoon in the funnel under the filter, so the grounds don't stick to the sides of the funnel through the paper. It gives the liquid more room to flow.)</p>

"<p>Yes, heating milk does have a perceptible effect on its taste.</p>

<p>That slightly sweet richness we perceive in milk is largely due to <em>lactose.</em> Lactose is the ""milk sugar"" which is a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disaccharide"" rel=""nofollow"">disaccharide</a> of glucose and galactose in solution in the milk. But lactose is also less soluble than sucrose (common table sugar) so it is perceived as <em>less sweet.</em></p>

<p>By increasing the temperature of the milk, you are increasing the solubility of the milk sugars which also increases its perceived sweetness. </p>

<p>If you were <em>steaming</em> the milk (common with lattes and cappuccinos), you would also be incorporating air to create a thicker, creamier consistency, which brings into play the fats and the proteins in the milk, all which play a part in the perceived richness of the beverage. </p>

"<p>I have read about the seemingly involved ""Nel Drip"" preparation method, and <strong>I'm wondering how Nel Pot preparation differs from regular pour-over or drip methods.</strong></p>

<p>Nel Drip preparation differs (from other pour-over/drip) in its apparatus (""Nel Pot""), which itself consists of a cotton / flannel filter loosely hanging or suspended over a glass carafe. It also seems to be called ""woodneck"" (but this is <em>not</em> the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemex_Coffeemaker"">Chemex</a>, which also has a wooden bit). ""Nel"" seems to be stylised as proper noun, but also seems to be short for flan-<strong><em>nel</em></strong>, and is of Japanese origin, though I can't find any proper references.</p>

<p>As with other brewing methods, there seems to be some kind of romantic fascination or magical mystique about it, and perhaps a ""cult-like following"" of sorts. I've seen widely varying comments, from the preparation method being fragile or finicky, to ""easy, cheap ... incredible"" (both from links above).</p>

<p>It looks like Nel Drip preparation takes <em>more gear, more preparation, more grounds, coarser grounds, and more maintenance</em>. There's talk of pre-boiling the filter, bamboo paddles, storing the filter in the fridge or freezer, ...?</p>

<p><strong>My Questions:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>How does it differ (in taste/outcome) from conventional paper filter pour-over/drip?</li>
<li>Preparation tips that are different from regular pour-over/drip?</li>
<li>Cleaning, maintenance, storage of the filters?</li>
</ul>

<p>I hope that some with experience can talk me into (or out of!) getting more coffee gear... :)</p>

"<p>Someone told me that the last drips coming out of a espresso machine after the pull is finished (when there is no water pressure any more) contain bad flavors. He recommended that I remove the coffee cup in the moment the machine stops producing pressure.</p>

<p>Is that true? If yes, why?</p>
"
"<p>My stomach doesn't take coffee kindly for some reason, but I do like the taste and smell of it.</p>

<p>Are there any coffee types out there for those with a similar issue?</p>
"
"<p>I suggest looking for coffee types with lower acidity.</p>

<p>Dark roasts <em>generally</em> have lower acidity. I do know that <strong>Nabob</strong> has an acidity rating right on it's packaging. Some coffee shops will also be able to tell you how acidic their coffee is.</p>

<p>All coffee reacts in the stomach to create acid though. If a low-acid coffee doesn't do the trick for you, then you might just not be able to drink coffee.</p>

<p>Caffeine can also cause GI sensitivity. You may try a decaf, however these can tend to be more acidic than normal coffees.</p>
"
"<p>The biggest chemical change that is going to occur is going to be <strong>oxidation.</strong></p>

<h2>Oxidation</h2>

<p>Chemically, oxidation is defined as the following from <a href=""http://www.blackbearcoffee.com/resources/81"" rel=""nofollow"">this source.</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Oxidation is any reaction in which one or more electrons
  are moved from one chemical to another, producing two different
  compounds.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Specifically related to coffee, oxidation is further elaborated upon as:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In coffee, the most common process is that an oxygen molecule donates
  two electrons to a compound, forming a new (differently perceived)
  compound and bonding with hydrogen to form water.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oxidation of coffee occurs when oxygen molecules (present in the air in your flask and also dissolved in the water used to brew the coffee) come into contact with different compounds in the coffee. Even if you had no air whatsoever in the flask, this process would still happen due to the dissolved oxygen in the water used to make the coffee.</p>

<p>The process of oxidation occurs much more readily at higher heats, hence the reason why cold brewed coffee does not go stale as quickly. </p>

<p>When the oxygen combines with the hydrogen, water is created. That hydrogen ion, when it was free, was adding to the acidity of the coffee. Once it is no longer free and connected to the oxygen, in the form of water, the pH of the coffee will rise slightly, making the coffee more bitter. This is can be perceived as 'staleness'.</p>

<p>The compounds which are oxidized are the acids, aromatics, and oils.  All of these give your coffee it's great taste.</p>

<h2>Loss of heat</h2>

<p>As the coffee cools, the molecules will vibrate more slowly. This leads to a drop in temperature and will occur in any container, no matter how good it is. Since you have described a situation with minimal heat loss, this process is negligible.</p>

<h2>In Conclusion</h2>

<p>The oxidation causes the coffee to become stale. This is a bean roasters worst nightmare. For the brewed coffee, it dismantles aromatics, acids, and oils - all key contributors to the coffee's flavor. It also raises the pH to make it more bitter and adds water to the mix.</p>

<p>So no, it won't taste the same at 5 pm as it would poured first thing in the morning. The taste of the coffee will change over the course of the day.</p>

<p><strong>Answering your final question about duration of freshness:</strong></p>

<p>How long will your coffee stay fresh in a perfect flask? That is a matter of opinion. Every coffee shop has a different standard for how long they let their brewed coffee sit. It can be 15 minutes to an hour.</p>

<p>As soon as you roast a bean, it begins to stale. As soon as you grind coffee, it begins to stale. As soon as you brew coffee, it begins to stale. It's hard to qualify what you will consider to be 'fresh'. A purist will tell you that unless you consume the coffee immediately, your coffee will be stale.</p>

<p>As I said, it is a matter of opinion, and if you have the perfect flask, I would say you could wait about an hour before your coffee becomes stale. That's just me though. <strong>The sooner you drink it the better.</strong></p>

<h2>What You Can Do</h2>

<p><strong>Ensure there is little to no air left in your flask.</strong> You might also look into cold brewing.</p>

"<p>I tried making cold brew for the first time recently and I just poured the whole mess through the <a href=""http://www.mrcoffee.com/parts-and-accessories/coffeemaker-gold-tone-permanent-filter-10-12-cup-cup-style/GTF2-NP.html"">reusable metal screen filter</a> that came with my cheap drip coffee machine. </p>

<p>My drip machine is the style where the top opens to add both coffee and water sort of like this:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/yPekO.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>So I just put the metal filter in and poured the cold brew straight into the filter allowing the filtered brew to flow into the regular pot below.</p>

<p>It worked pretty well for the 8 cups or so that I made and it looked like I probably could have gotten away with pouring a bit more. </p>
"
"<p>My espresso machine has a pretty impressive drip tray, at just around 1.5 liters in capacity, it holds quite a bit. </p>

<p>The problem is, if I empty it only when full, the bottom part of it has this really slippery, rather slimy surface which is extremely difficult to scrub. To be clear, it comes off easy enough, but tends to collect in nooks and corners.</p>

<p>I've tried adding a cap full of vinegar to the tray after cleaning and replacing it, this didn't make a noticeable difference. Even if I empty the tray when it's half full, there's still a bit of build up.</p>

<p>Is there anything else I can put in the bottom of the tray that wouldn't come with any competing odors to the coffee I'm brewing, but help keep this (as far as I can tell) 'water gunk' from forming? I'd <em>really</em> like to avoid dumping and cleaning the tray daily, as it is a bit of a chore. </p>
"
"<p>It's not really the pressure, that's just timing.</p>

<p>It depends on the beans and roast; your comparison point is the first few (after pre-infusion) drips that came out. The last ones are always going to be weaker and quite possibly more acidic because the puck is both drained and saturated at the same time. It's drained of oils and flavors, and saturated with hot water. </p>

<p>Whether or not you can actually <em>detect</em> that difference should it be added to the rest of the shot is a matter of uncertainty, hinging on your sense of taste and the type of coffee used. If it's a dark-roasted robusta blend then you <em>might</em> be able to detect a slight almost 'metallic' or slightly salty flavor, but you'd need an extremely acute sense of taste. The water you use also has a lot to do with this.</p>

<p>It can sometimes be easy to get caught up in what is <em>probably</em> happening, even if you (or most) can't really taste it. If you get more satisfaction out of your coffee because you've managed to improve the taste <em>even just a tiny bit</em> - then great, and keep doing it, because that's what it's all about. Just be critical and test for yourself, with your setup, and your beans :)</p>

"<p>I did a little bit of research at the site of inventor of the coffee filter. It's Melitta from Germany. In the <a href=""http://www.melitta.de/de/FAQ-229.html"" rel=""nofollow"">german FAQ</a> I found the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Warum falte ich Filterpapier vor dem Einlegen um?</strong> </p>
  
  <p>Damit die Kaffeezubereitung optimal funktioniert, muss das
  Filterpapier genau in die Form des Filters gebracht werden. Dies
  geschieht, indem Sie die beiden geprägten Ränder umfalten. Das
  Filterpapier schmiegt sich dadurch an den Rand des Filters an und
  sitzt tief im Filtereinsatz. Durch diese gute Passform kann sich das
  Filterpapier während des Brühvorgangs nicht einklappen</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In English:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Why I fold the coffee filter?</strong></p>
  
  <p>For a good result the coffee filter must be in exactly the form of the
  drippter. This is done by folding over the two embossed edges. The
  coffee filter is nestled by the edge of the dripper and sits deep in
  it. Through these good fit, the coffee filter can not collapse during
  the brewing process.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Additional fact: The coffee filter was not invented by Melitta the company, but by <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melitta_Bentz"" rel=""nofollow"">Melitta Bentz</a>.</p>

"<p>Preparation method will have a big factor in extraction, acidity (such as in @Patrick's answer) among them.

<p><strong>Try cold brew.</strong> Cold brew coffee will have lower acidity, and might be a good option for you; <a href=""http://www.specialty-coffee-advisor.com/coffee-brewing.html"">here's an article</a> that discusses different preparation methods, but in the cold-brew section it has an anecdote of someone with similar ""stomach"".

<p><strong>Paper filtering</strong> seems to remove some acids, but it's not clear whether these are the type that might argue with your stomach. For example, <a href=""http://aerobie.com/Products/Details/AeroPressFAQ.htm"">The AeroPress FAQ</a> claims that their paper filter creates lower acidity brew, but I can't immediately find a better, proper reference.</p>

<p><strong>Try some antacid.</strong> If you're experiencing heartburn, try a calcium-based antacid before and/or after drinking the coffee, and see if that changes things. (Disclaim: This isn't medical advice, don't take it if you shouldn't, talk to a doctor about meds, etc.).</p>

"<p>Certainly the brewing process will extract different flavor characteristics from your grounds as it goes through its cycle. But a well-designed machine is designed to produce a full-bodied, well-balanced beverage <strong>as the <em>END</em> product.</strong></p>

<p>If your machine is working properly, you shouldn't really have to evaluate the drop by drop extraction process as being ""less tasty"" or ""more tasty"" as it goes through that cycle. A good cup of coffee has many subtle complexities, and whatever comes out of that machine at the end is also part of that overall ""recipe."" </p>

<p>Yes, if you <em>know</em> your coffee to be ""over extracted"", then perhaps you can compensate a bit by pulling a cup early; but that's a bit like buying a bad pie and just eating out the filling because the crust doesn't taste as good. </p>

<p>You have to adjust your process. You can select your beans, grind them accordingly, and select/use a machine so the end product is to your taste. But if everything is working as it should, pulling that cup early is more likely to create a dull, lifeless brew than just letting the process complete as designed. Second-guessing your machine is a hack, not a solution.</p>

"<p>If what you're seeing is mold or algae you may want to add a few table spoons of salt to the drip pan.</p>

<p>I'm guessing that your slime is probably a fungus of some kind, rather than an algae. It has found a rather nice living arrangement for a fungi. Plenty of warm water and decomposing coffee, with very little light.</p>

<p>Salt should in most cases prevent fungal growth, this may sound odd but it will dehydrate the cells even when they're immersed in water, sort of a ""water, water everywhere but not a drop to drink"".</p>

<p>If you would rather get high tech with it, you could try a UV light, similar to the ones used in AC systems. The harsh UV rays will kill most molds and prevent them from colonizing.</p>

"<p>I was in Yemen a few years ago, and when ordering ""Yemenite Coffee"" there, one would get a cup with a liquid which tasted like coffee, but from the intensity, color and strength was more like tea.</p>

<p>I was told the coffee was made from the peelings of the coffee beans (because all the beans are determined for export).</p>

"<p>It sounds like you had <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_cherry_tea"">coffee cherry tea</a>, also called <em>cascara</em>, and regionally other names; in Yemen it seems to be called <em>qishr</em> according to Wikipedia. </p>

<p>It's (to me) delicious, but rather different than roasted, brewed coffee beans. It has a lovely red hue, similar to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rooibos"">rooibos</a> but lighter. </p>

<p>It's made by infusing the dried coffee cherries or just the husks (as you described in the question). It is steeped like an herbal tea, in hot water just off the boil. <a href=""http://www.benttreecoffee.com/allcoffees/cascara-coffee-cherry-tea"">This article</a> says that it can be brewed using cold-brew techniques also. I've only had it cold/iced or lukewarm, but it is probably lovely hot also. </p>
"
"<p>Recipes vary according to taste, but if you want a similar concentration (""strength"") of coffee, you'll probably want to use a stronger brew of coffee (basically amounts to using more grounds). This is because you're diluting the coffee when you add the ice (which melts), even more so if you're trying to start with freshly brewed and very hot coffee (melting more ice). Here's a suggestion from <a href=""http://www.chow.com/recipes/30487-basic-cold-brewed-coffee"" rel=""nofollow"">Chow</a> and a discussion from <a href=""http://www.seriouseats.com/2014/05/whats-the-best-way-to-brew-iced-coffee.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Serious Eats</a> that discuss the methods. </p>

<p>Personally, though, I prefer the result of cold-brewed coffee. Rather than brewed-hot and served-cold, it's both brewed <em>and</em> served cold. I think the cold-brew extraction is a better complement to the cold service. Furthermore, less ice might be needed to cool the beverage to a similar temperature, which is an added bonus. See the myriad questions with <a href=""/questions/tagged/cold-brew"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged 'cold-brew'"" rel=""tag"">cold-brew</a> for more on that subject. </p>

"<p>You really just need to empty the drip tray more often. The slime is algae or bacteria living and breeding in the nutrient-rich and warm tray water.</p>

<p>It sounds like you're interpreting the large drip tray as rationale to only clean it when it gets full — it’s not. Your tray is huge, and it’s probably intended for more industrial applications (like a coffee shop) that could produce a liter of waste water a day (too little time for slime to form. </p>

<p>If you need motivation to clean the tray more frequently, think about all the nastiness that's only a few inches from the coffee you’re making. Think of all the nasty mold and slime spores floating around in the air and landing in your newly brewed beverage. </p>

"<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffea_arabica""><em>Coffea Arabica</em></a> and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robusta_coffee""><em>Coffea Canephora</em></a> are the only two species of plants whose beans we use to make coffee - Arabica and Robusta respectively. </p>

<p>However, you may have heard of other 'types' of coffee that might be confusing. For example <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peaberry"">Peaberry Coffee</a> is not actually a separate bean type. 5-10% of harvested coffee berries contain only one bean (instead of two).

Here is <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_coffee_varieties"">a list of (some) coffee varieties</a>; see note [1]. Perhaps you've seen some cultivars listed on packaging, like Harar, Java, Kona, or Yirgacheffe. These can (but don't always) also indicate a region of origin (e.g., some cultivars are only grown in certain regions).</p>

<p>There are analogies to other plants, like the many cultivars of the following, for examples:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabbage"">cabbage</a>, </li>
<li>tea (which is mostly cultivars of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camellia_sinensis"">one species</a>, though there are other tisanes or infusions made of, e.g., herbs and other non-tea plants)</li>
<li>wine (which is made mostly from cultivars of one species, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitis_vinifera""><em>Vitus vinifera</em></a>, of which there <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_grape_varieties"">5 or 10 <em>thousand</em> cultivars</a>, though wine can be made out of, e.g., other non-grape fruits also.)</li>
</ul>

"<p>I think you're a little confused here.</p>

<p>Coffee contains caffeine (a psychoactive drug), as does tea (although in lower quantities). Coca-cola and related beverages also contain caffeine.</p>

<p>If you want similar effects to those you've listed, but without caffeine, your options are going to be limited to, well, other psychoactive drugs. All drugs have effects and side-effects that are rather different, so there is nothing that's the same as caffeine.</p>

"
"<p>First of all, there is no difference in the beans themselves. They all come from either Robusta or Arabica plants. The roast doesn't vary either. You can use any kind of roast for your espresso, it's up to preference.</p>

<p>What <em>does</em> change is the grind. Espresso grind is very fine - much finer than other preparations of coffee.</p>

<p>You may find packaged coffee sold as 'espresso beans' or 'espresso roast' being darker/bolder roasts, to emulate a darker, stronger coffee regardless of preparation, however it has little to do with real espresso (and you may even find 'espresso' ground coffees being sold with a large/inconsistent grind!).</p>

"<p>While you may not find many perfect substitutes for caffeine which will give you all of the same effects, there are things you can do which will decrease your need for caffeine.  A quick search reveals a few things you can do:</p>

<ul>
<li>Eat Apples and other fruits - Calories, high fructose levels, vitamins,
and antioxidants they provide are all important for sustaining energy levels
throughout the day.</li>
<li>Maintain your <a href=""http://familydoctor.org/familydoctor/en/prevention-wellness/food-nutrition/nutrients/vitamin-b-12.printerview.all.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Vitamin B12</a> level - Decreased levels of Vitamin<br>

<li>Exercise - Many studies have shown that exercising in the morning can
give you more of an energy boost than caffeine.</li>
<li>Get a good nights sleep - well, obviously.</li>
</ul>

<p>I guess you could sum this answer up with saying a balanced diet, exercise, and a healthy sleep cycle all are necessary for you to sustain your energy levels throughout the day, remain alert, and increase your metabolism.</p>

"<p>There is no actual difference between ""espresso beans"" and ""coffee beans""; in reality, they are both just ""coffee beans"". When you see something packaged as ""espresso beans"" or ""espresso roast"" it is most likely just a dark roast designed to taste good when ground ultra fine and used to make espresso.</p>

<p>When it comes down to it, the only thing that changes is the grind (espresso is generally ground very fine). The actual roast or bean used is up to your personal preference; one local coffee shop that I enjoy uses a blonde roast for their espresso, while another one right down the street uses a very dark french-italian roast.</p>

<p>As far as the beans themselves are concerned, there are only two types of coffee bean: <em>C. arabica</em>, and <em>C. robusta</em>. Both are suitable for espresso, or drip coffee, or any other preparation method (in fact, you've probably had both many times without even realizing it).</p>

<p><em>TL;DR</em> — There is no such thing as an ""espresso bean""; it's all just coffee.</p>

"<p>Melange is the most popular coffee beverage in Vienna, Austria and surrounding. It's preparation and look is in my humble opinion exactly the same as Cappuccino. You use an espresso shot, create some milk foam, add the hot milk together with the milk foam on top. Some will sprinkle some cocoa or cinnamon powder on top.</p>

<p>So is it only the name or is there any deeper difference that the customer do not see?</p>

"<p>In Spain one <a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0023643804000933"" rel=""nofollow"">study</a> showed that <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffea_arabica"" rel=""nofollow"">Brazilian Arabica</a> 100% (A100) roasted samples <strong>presented lower antioxidant capacity</strong> (less efficient antioxidants) than <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robusta_coffee"" rel=""nofollow"">Robusta coffee</a> varieties (could be due to the higher percentage of chlorogenic acids in Robusta ground coffee than in Arabica) therefore <strong>Brazilian Arabica 100% (A100) presented the highest value of pro-oxidant activity</strong>.</p>

<p>However <strong>higher antioxidant activity was observed in <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_production_in_Colombia"" rel=""nofollow"">Colombian coffees</a></strong> than in conventional roasted coffee blends. On the other hand, when the percentage of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torrefacto"" rel=""nofollow"">torrefacto coffee</a> was increased, an increase of the antioxidant activity and a slight tendency to decrease the pro-oxidant activity were observed. Therefore <strong>addition of sugar</strong> at the end of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torrefacto"" rel=""nofollow"">the torrefacto</a> roasting process <strong>may influence the antioxidant and pro-oxidant properties</strong> of coffee because sugar is one of the main precursors the Maillard reaction.</p>

<p>In summary, we can say that antioxidant and pro-oxidant capacity of ground coffee can be affected by several factors such as coffee variety, roasting process (e.g. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torrefacto"" rel=""nofollow"">torrefacto</a>), growing climate, storage, etc. The details of the studies for further reading can be found below.</p>

"<p>My take on this is to focus on the mechanics and preparation, which I think is an important part (though perhaps not <em>all</em>) of a cappuccino being properly made.</p>

<p>Fundamentally, a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cappuccino#Preparation"" rel=""nofollow"">cappuccino</a> consists of espresso and steamed milk (see distinction from a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latte"" rel=""nofollow"">latte</a>). The <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Barista_Championship"" rel=""nofollow"">World Barista Championship</a> specifies the proper construction in their <a href=""http://www.worldbaristachampionship.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/2015-WBC-FINAL.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">beverage definitions (.PDF)</a> in §2.2.2. It consists of a single-shot of espresso (25 mL / ~0.8 fl. oz.), textured (steamed) milk, and <em>at least</em> 1 cm of foam (other places suggest 2 cm). Total volume is 150-180 mL / 5-6 fl. oz.  To the extent that you subscribe to the WBC being a benchmark, the <strong>components</strong>, <strong>volume</strong>, and <strong>amount of foam</strong> define physical properties of a properly made cappuccino. It also states that the components should be in ""harmonious balance.""</p>

<p>The WBC states that aspects of the service are also crucial, such as</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>visual appearance</strong>, such as that the beverage should fill the cup;</li>
<li><strong>served with accoutrements</strong>, such as ""spoon, napkin and unflavoured water"";</li>
<li><strong>logistical aspects</strong> of drinking, such as temperature and holding the cup.</li>
</ul>

<p>Beyond that, there's a lot of variability that might lean closer to personal preference. Some other topics mentioned at WBC and Wikipedia include being ""wet"" (referring to the foam, versus ""dry""), and ""traditional"" (solid central circle of white foam, versus having <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latte_art"" rel=""nofollow"">latte art</a>).</p>

<p>Other recipes for cappuccino at home vary greatly:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://www.folgerscoffee.com/coffee-how-to/how-to-videos/cappuccino"" rel=""nofollow"">Folgers suggests</a> to use equal parts of coffee (French press or drip), steamed milk, and foam. You'll get a rather different outcome from using coffee instead of espresso.</li>
<li><a href=""http://www.illy.com/wps/wcm/connect/en/coffee/how-prepare-cappuccino"" rel=""nofollow"">illy suggests</a> quantities for a more traditional preparation, using espresso and steamed/foamed milk.</li>

"<p>I was interested today in making some cold brew. I have a french press so I'd like to use that.</p>

<p>What is your recommended brewing time?
Does this make a concentrate?
What ratio do you use later to dilute that concentrate?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance!</p>
"
"<p>First, make sure to study <a href=""http://coffee.stackexchange.com/q/400/277"">What do I need to start cold-brewing</a>. But since concentrate is not discussed there, I don't think your question is a duplicate. Your French press concentrate could last a couple days, depending on the consumption.</p>

<p>Assuming you divide the volume of the French press by 5, you would need 1 part of ground coffee (the usual coarse grind you use in the press; extraction is weaker at low temperatures but the time makes up for it even with coarse grind) and 4 parts of fresh room-temperature water, which you gently mix and stir. The coffee should sit for about 12-16 hours at room temperature. Then plunge, and here is the concentrate. To dilute, use another 8 parts of cold water or milk (or better, start with 5-6 parts and taste to determine whether you want it still thinner).</p>

"<p>In short: there is no minimum recommended age for drinking coffee, but on the other hand it's not good idea to have kids drink coffee all day long.</p>

<p>It is discussed in depth in the <a href=""//parenting.stackexchange.com/questions/637/how-long-should-i-wait-before-i-permit-my-children-to-have-access-to-caffeine"">parenting site of Stack Exchange</a> and the top answer thee states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The bottom line is that caffeine is generally safe, but it does have significant effects in children as well as adults. Note that children are much more likely to encounter caffeine in a soft drink than in tea or coffee; that's what you have to worry about, I think, not Starbucks. A cup of green tea contains ~15-25 mg of caffeine, which is around the limit where there were no noteworthy affects for a 50 kg child, so if they want to hang out at a cafe, they don't even have to limit themselves to strictly caffeine-free options</p>
</blockquote>

"<p>I have often heard and seen, especially in Italy, recommendations to avoid coffee with milk like Latte or Cappuccino in the afternoon, while Espresso is widely consumed during this time of day. </p>

<p>What is the reason for this? Why would one avoid milk-based coffee drinks during the afternoon?</p>
"
"<p><strong>It is a cultural issue, not a health one.</strong></p>

<p>Traditionally, rich, big coffee drinks like a cappuccino are drunk in the morning in Italy with breakfast whereas espresso is what is drunk in the afternoon. The reasoning for this is that you can take your time and savor a cappuccino in the morning because presumably you are not at work yet, but in the afternoon you are just in and out for a quick energy infusion on a 15 minute break and you don't have the time to drink anything but a shot or two of espresso. </p>

<p>In America people tend to do just the opposite or just drink what they want, when they want which can lead to some judgement when visiting Italy. </p>
"
"<p>...also called Arabic, Cypriot, Bosnian, and what not -- it is the same method.</p>

<p>In Greece, it's become <em>Greek coffee</em> (along with the former ""Turkish"" <em>Greek delight</em>) after conflicting with Turkey and the 1974 invasion of Cyprus.</p>

<p>The method itself (boiling finely ground coffee in copper cezve, typically sweetened, and served in a demitasse) is said to stem from 15th century Yemen, reaching Constantinople in 17th century and consequently spreading across Ottoman Empire.</p>

<p>Apparently, there are interesting variations to it. For instance, <em>Syrian coffee</em> (and probably some others) is flavoured by cardamom.</p>

"<p>Can I just add the coffee powder to the basket and let the the water vapour do the work or should I make use of a tamp same as with a professional Espresso machine?  </p>
"
"<p>You should not tamp the coffee in a Moka. These pots don't like excessive pressure, which tamping would produce due to increased density. This is also why the water should not cover the steam valve. In the worst case they can literally explode!</p>
"
"<p>It may completely be abuse of the machine, but I saw someone clean stainless steel jewelry once in an ECM machine. They put the jewelry in a sealed portafilter basket and backflushed the machine with cleaning detergent.</p>

<p>It seemed to clean the jewelry pretty well, but I can't say if it would be very different from putting it in the dishwasher.</p>

<p>At the very least, it seems to be a way to kill two birds with one stone when backflushing your machine.</p>

"<p>I am not a doctor.</p>

<p>From a medical standpoint, pure caffeine (citrate) is often used in newborns with breathing problems in <a href=""http://www.drugs.com/dosage/caffeine.html#Usual_Pediatric_Dose_for_Apnea_of_Prematurity"" rel=""nofollow"">controlled doses (5 mg/kg/day)</a>.  So, I wouldn't say it's dangerous for otherwise healthy small children in properly sized doses.  However, it generally isn't used long term and is used as a bridging therapy until a newborn's lungs develop fully.  </p>

<p>That being said, I have small children of my own and don't plan to help them develop an addiction to a CNS stimulant until they are old enough to support that socially acceptable addiction on their own paychecks.</p>

As said in this <a href=""http://kidshealth.org/parent/growth/feeding/child_caffeine.html"" rel=""nofollow"">website</a>, USA has not made any guidelines but recommends putting caffeine to a minimum in younger kids. Drinking too much coffee or at the wrong time can harm children in multiple ways. Canadian guidelines though, say that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Canadian guidelines recommend that preschoolers get no more than 45 milligrams of caffeine a day. That's equivalent to the average amount of caffeine found in a single 12-ounce (355-milliliter) can of soda.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yep, preschoolers might as well be drinking a 12 ounce Cola-Cola every day. Side effects in <strong><em>both</em></strong> kids and adults can be pretty annoying. One way it affects young children maybe:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Lack of sleep</p></li>
<li><p>Unable to learn at school properly</p></li>
<li><p>Sleepiness</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Adults... Well you know what some of your side effects are. You can say it can you get you drunk, except you get more active then sleepy. Drinking coffee or high-caffeine drinks are said ""to help with studying"" but in a Houston news study, most college students can barely remember what they learned during their ""caffeine overload"". But, it is all your decision. If you think it's okay , do it and vice versa. I hope this helps you!</p>

"<p>Although this was kind of asked in <a href=""http://coffee.stackexchange.com/q/14/127"">this question</a>, it was as a side-question that wasn't really answered.</p>

"<p>Caffeinated beverages like coffee and soft drinks give short bursts of energy, but can actually cause fluid loss. Caffeine has been shown to temporarily raise blood pressure, and reduces blood flow to inactive limbs.</p>

<p>Like many drugs, caffeine is <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/05/us/yes-people-are-right-caffeine-is-addictive.html"">chemically addictive</a> and recent publication of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), caffeine withdrawal was finally included as a mental disorder for the first time.</p>

<p>Soon after you drink coffee (containing caffeine), it’s absorbed through the small intestine and dissolved into the bloodstream and it’s able to penetrate the blood-brain barrier and enter the brain.</p>

<p>Regular ingestion of the drug (i.e. coffee/tea, soda or energy drinks) alters your brain’s chemistry and physical characteristics actually change over time, leading to fatigue, headaches and nausea if you try to quit.

  Substance-Related Disorder Work Group for DSM-5 (via New York Post).
  “But it does have a letdown afterwards. If you drink a lot of coffee,

"<p>Over the past few years I've been slowly starting to dabble in the caffeinated arts.  I'm far from being knowledgeable, but I'm definitely very curious about this favourite beverage of mine.  So, I occasionally read up on it.</p>

<p>Not long ago I discovered something called <strong>Bulletproof Coffee</strong>.  It seems to be associated with the Paleo diet movement.  It involves adding butter to your coffee.</p>

<p>I asked around at a few coffee shops but nobody seems to know why anyone would do this!</p>

<p>Articles such as <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2014/nov/25/bulletproof-coffee-is-adding-butter-to-your-morning-coffee-a-step-too-far"">this</a> one claim it gives an energy boost.</p>

<p>Is this true?  If so, what is the science behind this?</p>
"
"<p>The fundamental science seems to be: <a href=""http://chemse.oxfordjournals.org/content/20/6/609.abstract"" rel=""nofollow"">Sodium salts suppress the perception of bitterness</a>. It specifically mentions caffeine, which is one of the bitter components of coffee. This <a href=""http://chemistry.about.com/od/foodchemistryfaqs/f/Does-Salt-In-Coffee-Reduce-Bitterness.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">About article</a> lists a few more references to the same thing: The sodium ion works by ""interfering with the transduction mechanism of [bitterness].""</p>

<p>The point is, it's a change in <em>perception</em>; e.g., the salt is not chemically changing the bitter compounds, just interfering with the bitterness receptors in your tongue. Conversely, the article seems to suggest that the bitterness doesn't reduce the perception of saltiness; this to me suggests that your coffee will taste salty. <em>Caveat emptor!</em> There's a bit more discussion on the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taste#Saltiness"" rel=""nofollow"">saltiness</a> and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taste#Bitterness"" rel=""nofollow"">bitterness</a> sections of the Wikipedia article on taste.</p>

<p>The idea seems to be to flood yourself with stimulants and concentrated sources of macronutrient energy. According to the linked Wikipedia article (additional references available there), MCTs (Medium-chain triglycerides) are easy for the body to absorb and use (they require less digestion and less energy to use). MCTs are also purported to have appetite-surpressing and energy-burning benefits (Wikipedia article has links on both sides of that debate). The idea of butter (especially organic butter from pasture-raised animals) is to provide beneficial fatty acids (organic/pasture-raised butter purportedly having better Omega-3 content (see another <a href=""http://skeptics.stackexchange.com/q/6707"">skeptics.SE question about this</a>) and vitamins -- both being purported for ""energy"" benefit. </p>

<p>That's my take on the ""theory"" anyway; hopefully someone else has better links to some peer-reviewed study.</p>

<p>I tried this concoction once, and found it (personally) to be not tasty enough to drink. I can't comment first-hand on any energy boost, because I didn't choose to consume any appreciable amount of it.</p>

"<p>This is a perfect follow up to the ""<a href=""http://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/66/what-coffees-are-the-least-acidic/181#181"">What coffees are the least acidic?</a>"" question! </p>

<p>As always, <strong>Lets answer it with some data!</strong> <a href=""http://Gastrograph.com"" rel=""nofollow"">My company</a> uses machine learning, data science, and sensory science to build flavor profiling and quality control tools for the craft beverage industry. </p>

<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Yes. Preparation has a significant affect on the flavor profile of coffee - including the level of acidity. </p>

<h1>Distribution of Acidity by Brewing Method</h1>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/bvYFi.png"" alt=""Boxplot of Sour &amp; Acidity by brewing method""></p>

<p>If I may present to you... the distribution of acidity in coffee by brewing method! 
Clearly and without surprise, Espresso (coffee extracted under pressure) is the most acidic preparation method, on average. French Press (full immersion brewing) is the least acidic, and V60 (a type of pour-over) has the widest range.</p>

<p><strong>But is there something else going on here?</strong> 
What if there exists a conflating factor such as green processing, roast level, or growing environment? Some of these questions we're already answered in the link above, so lets focused on the remaining question - how does the origin of the coffee effect the perceived acidity of the coffee by brewing method? </p>

<hr>

<h1>Acidity by Brewing Method Controlling for Continent of Origin</h1>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/mie4a.png"" alt=""Acidity by brewing method controlling for continent""></p>

<p>So is the effect of brewing method consistent? No. 
What we're seeing here is that each continent tends towards a different green processing technique, and thus a different optimal level of roast - all of which exert as much influence over the resulting level of acidity in the flavor profile of the coffee. </p>

<hr>

<h1>Please just save me from exogenous variables</h1>

<p>Oh... you should have just said so.... </p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/kmild.png"" alt=""Inference Tree of Acidity in Coffee""></p>

C is Country 
P is Preparation 
G is Green Processing

"<p>There seems to be a very blurred line between actual nutritional energy (calories) and stimulants (caffeine) in many people's mind.  It is an oxymoron to have a zero calorie energy drink, but there are plenty of them on the market.  That being said, there are many coffee drinks out there that add calories to your morning stimulant routine.  Encouraging a healthier source of calories isn't necessarily a bad thing.</p>

<p>A cup of black coffee has almost no calories (no energy).  Adding anything to that coffee that provides a significant source of calories (milk, sugar, chocolate, whip cream, butter, flavored syrup) will provide actually nutritional energy as opposed to just the stimulant effect that black coffee provides.</p>

<p>All that being said when you start claiming you have magic beans and that all the other coffee in the world is hosting some sort of fungus party, I feel you've crossed the line into marketing snake-oil.  My perhaps favorite quote from that site:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Roasting the beans enhances their antioxidant capacity and flavor to
  provide you with a healthier, tastier cup of coffee.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The beans he is selling are more than 50% more than a bag of quality specialty coffee.  His main selling point is perhaps that it is ""mycotoxin free"".  A condition that is apparently <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7451391"">fairly common</a> among most coffees.</p>

"<p><strong>Lets answer this question with some data!</strong> <a href=""http://Gastrograph.com"">My company</a> uses machine learning, data science, and sensory science to build flavor profiling and quality control tools for the craft beverage industry. </p>

<p>Lets use some of our 9,000+ full sensory reviews to examine the difference between Paper Filter Pour-over coffees and the Nel.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Nel takes a ton of work to do properly and consistently - but produces a distinct and interesting flavor profile difficult if not impossible to achieve through other brewing methods. </p>

<hr>

<h1>The Data</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Data</strong> </p>
  
  <p>7,371 Reviews of Central American Washed Coffees brewed in Chemex, Beehouse, kalita wave, or  V60 with a paper filter</p>
  
  <p>Average of 7 day old coffee with a SD of 5 days, the data is evenly dichotomously split between a ratio of 40:600 and 35:400 (up-dose) <code>grams of water : grams of coffee</code></p>
  
  <hr>
  
  <p>2,143 Reviews of Central American Washed Coffees brewed in Nel;</p>
  
  <p>Average of 30 day old coffee with a SD of 10 days, brewed at approx 50g coffee to 180 ml water</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<h1>Differences in the Beans - before preparation</h1>

<p>Proper <strong>Nel</strong> uses old beans, usually a month past roast - <a href=""http://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/123/when-does-coffee-go-off/166#166"">often considered stale!</a> This is a historical antecedent - fresh coffee was hard to come by when the dutch we're the only trading partner (for some time, and the only one shipping coffee) for Japan.</p>

<p><strong>Pour-Over</strong> Methods produce the best flavor profile using fresh coffee (less than 14 days from roast, on average). </p>

<hr>

<h1>Differences in Preparation</h1>

<p><strong>Nel:</strong> Very high coffee to water ratio, hovering around ~50g coffee to ~200g water. Very slow pour. It should take at least 6 min to pour the water through the grinds.</p>

<p><strong>Pour-over:</strong> More standard coffee to water ration, often around ~40g coffee to ~600g water. Standard pour rate, with total brew time around 4 min. </p>

<hr>

<h1>Differences in Flavor Profile</h1>

<p>For this section of the analysis, I will be using the Gastrograph to communicate complex flavor profiles consistently and simply. On the Gastrograph, the intensity is shown ranging from 0, the center of the graph, to 5 (the outer most point).</p>

<p>Let's look at the difference in flavor profiles of <em>Central American Coffees</em> below: </p>

"<p>I just ate a protein bar with coffee beans in it. I get that it is a good energy source and it tastes like coffee but is the coffee beans prepared in a certain way. I'm not quite sure if they are edible raw or what the beans have to go through. So how does raw coffee beans become edible coffee beans that can be put into all sorts of foods? Or are coffee beans left raw or even both? Please use reliable sources and all help is appreciated!</p>
"
"<p>Another view on this:</p>

<p>Bulletproof coffee is often used with a low-carb diet, often referred to as the ""keto diet"", which has some similarities with Paleo, but is quite different. The diet requires you to cut out as many carbohydrates as possible out of your diet in order to get your body into a state of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketosis"">ketosis</a>, where most of the energy in the body is produced by processing fat instead of carbohydrates.</p>

<p>When following the keto diet, you need to eat a lot of fat, minimum carbohydrates and a reasonable amount of protein. The goal is to get most of your calories from fat. Getting in all the fat that is required is often difficult, so in that context, bulletproof coffee is nothing more than a delivery method for fat. There's nothing special about it, it's just easier to drink a spoonful of butter melted in coffee than eating it on its own.</p>

<p>If you want to read up on keto further, the keto reddit has lots of resources on it: <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/keto"">http://www.reddit.com/r/keto</a></p>

"<p>I suppose you can if you can first make a decent coffee plant(s) to first make the coffee. Using this <a href=""http://www.thanksgivingcoffee.com/blog/?p=174"" rel=""nofollow"">website</a> can help you with your gardening/farming of coffee plants. It is mainly based in the USA so sorry! Some tips to notice for decent coffee beans:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Don't put coffee plants in direct sunlight for too long. It will kill your plant and ruin your life. Most coffee plants need little sunlight to survive.</p></li>
<li><p>It takes 10 minutes of frost/3 hours of direct sunlight outside from May and November will kill it.</p></li>
<li><p>Place it near or at the east-facing window to get a good morning sun and just enough sunlight from the afternoon.</p></li>
<li><p>Use warm water but don't flood the pots with it.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Making the drinkable coffee will the hard part I guess. Here is a seemingly a good website for roasting at home: <a href=""http://www.breworganic.com/coffee/howtoroast.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">Roasting at Home</a>. Remember to use green, unroasted coffee beans!</p>
"
"<p><em>Roasted</em> coffee beans (from which you'd brew coffee as usual) are certainly edible -- <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chocolate-covered_coffee_bean"">chocolate-covered coffee beans</a> are an example. They don't need any different or additional processing beyond ordinary roasting; I'm guessing that was what was in your bar. Chew a whole roasted coffee bean; does it taste similar?</p>

<p>If you're asking about green beans, a quick search suggests that raw coffee beans contain some <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_bean#Composition"">questionable chemicals</a>; however, <a href=""http://coffee.stackexchange.com/q/284/262"">this question about the edibility of coffee cherries</a> seems to indicate that they're not harmful...</p>

"<p>Some people make jam out of coffee fruits, and I would like to try that out. It seems difficult, as it requires getting actual fruits, and as fresh as possible---probably even harder out of the Green Belt.</p>

<p>What variety of coffee should I order?</p>

<hr>

<p>A bit of background: The jam idea comes from reading a story around the 2014 barista selection to represent the U.S. One contender partnered with a Venezuelan coffee farmer, whose mother was making traditional jam with coffee. That's how I got into searching more.</p>

"<p>I hope the question isn't too broad or fuzzy. But quite a while ago, I stumbled across coffee that was prepared with eggs. The basic recipe involved mixing ground coffee with raw eggs (I think even <em>with</em> their shells), then cooking that mix with water and filtering it afterwards. The end result of that was in consistence and taste not much different from classic (drip, so to say) coffee, but had a notable and interesting by-taste of egg.</p>

<p>This was quite bit unusual to me and I didn't ever encounter this recipe again (yet am not an expert on the topic either). So I would first and foremost like to know if that preparation method is some kind of established or regional variation of coffee and how that actually developed or what the reasons/advantages for this somehow unusual combination are, be they nutritional, historical or just because it tastes good.</p>
"
"<p>So I did a bit of research, and found a number of regional claims to 'egg coffee', including  Swedish, Norwegian, Vietnamese and the American Mid-West. Of course I also found an article on <a href=""http://puttingweirdthingsincoffee.com/2010/01/28/putting-an-egg-in-coffee-eggspresso/"">Putting Weird Things In Coffee</a>, which should be taken with a pinch of salt<sup>1</sup>.</p>

<p>There seem to be a variety of approaches, but they seem to fall into three main camps:</p>

<ul>
<li>Add just the white and the shell</li>
<li>Add just the <em>yolk</em> and the shell</li>
<li>Add the whole egg, including the shell</li>
</ul>

<p>Across the different techniques, adding the shell was the only real unifying theme! It's said to reduce bitterness (I imagine because the shell is essentially calcium-carbonate, which is basic). The technique is to just crush up the shell, mix it and the egg contents with the coffee and pour over boiling water.</p>

<p>The grounds will bind with the egg protein and sink in the cup. They can then be strained off.</p>

<p>The only other recipe I found is specifically for Vietnamese egg coffee, which I found <a href=""http://www.legalnomads.com/2013/01/vietnamese-egg-coffee-recipe.html"">here</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  
  <ul>
  <li>1 egg </li>
  <li>3 teaspoons of Vietnamese coffee powder</li>
  <li>2 teaspoons of sweetened condensed milk</li>
  <li>Boiling water </li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Directions</h2>
  
  <p>Brew a small cup of Vietnamese coffee. Crack
  an egg and discard the whites. Put the yolk and the sweetened
  condensed milk in a small, deep bowl and whisk vigorously until you
  end up with a frothy, fluffy mixture like the one above. Add a
  tablespoon of the brewed coffee and whisk it in. In a clear coffee cup
  (we’re going for aesthetics here), pour in your brewed coffee, then
  add the fluffy egg mixture on top. Presto. Egg coffee.</p>

<p>Are there different receipies from different cultures? If so, what are they?</p>
"
"<p>I decided to give this a shot and made up a recipe myself:</p>

<p>I started out by simply making a press pot of coffee:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/vcDo4.jpg"" alt=""french press""></p>

<p>then, after letting the coffee cool and steep for a few minutes, mixed up and <a href=""http://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/4208/how-do-i-temper-an-egg"">tempered</a> two eggs (shell and all) by spooning in some of the coffee and grounds:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/b5Mf7.jpg"" alt=""tempering the eggs""></p>

<p>This part starts to look pretty nasty, but persevere:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/iRGCK.jpg"" alt=""tempered eggs""></p>

<p>Whip the eggs into an emulsion (or close to it; this will be much easier with a whisk), and pour them into the press pot. Once you're done you should have an eggy crema on top (I think I needed one or two more eggs for the entire press pot):</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/LYITX.jpg"" alt=""egg coffee""></p>

<p>As far as I can tell, it just tastes like coffee (the egg is hardly noticeable, and just tones down the flavor a bit like cream or milk). Using one or two more eggs (for a full pot like this) would probably have helped. Also, make sure you let the coffee cool enough before tempering your eggs, or you'll just wind up with scrambled egg floating in coffee despite the fact that you tempered it.</p>
"
"<p>Well, there is this website on <a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/89GL4.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">Norwegian Egg Coffee</a>. It is a a recipe on egg coffee, Norwegian style! Sadly, I am not a chef, but it only has 4 steps:<br></p>

<p>Ingredients:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>80 g coarsely ground coffee (roughly 200 mL) </p></li>
<li><p>1 egg</p></li>
<li><p>100 mL cold water</p></li>
<li><p>2.5 L boiling water</p></li>
<li><p>250 mL cold water</p></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Mix coffee with an egg and 100 mL cold water to a thick paste. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You simply mix your coffee with an egg plus 100 ml/ a fifth of a pint of cold water with something like a spoon until it becomes a thick paste. It should get harder as the paste thickens along the way.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Add this mixture to the boiling water (2.5 L in a pot on the stove over a fire to be exact), stir carefully and leave to boil for 2-3 min. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Put the paste in boiling water that is placed in a metal pot over a fire on a stove. Stir carefully then leave the mixture to boil for 2 to 3 minutes. There will be a difference in the end product depending on how much you stirred it:
<img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/89GL4.jpg"" alt=""""></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Difference between much (left) and little (right) stirring as the coffee boils as seen from the precipitate at the bottom of a glass of egg coffee. <strong>PythonMaster's Note</strong>: This is the caption for the picture above.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The next step is actually the next step in the recipe, not a caption:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Remove pot from stove and add the remaining cold water</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Clearly, remove your pot from the stove and then add remaining 250 ml of cold water into the pot. Pretty self-explanatory.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Let the grounds settle for a couple of minutes, skim off any floating particles, filter through a fine meshed sieve, a cheese cloth or filter paper and serve. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Place the mixture somewhere and let the grounds settle for a couple minutes (You probably want to put this in a cup or container). As it settles, use a spoon to remove any floating particles in the mixture. Then after it settles, put the mixture through some type of sieve (please have container underneath or you will have a really delicious mess to clean up) and finally... <strong><em>DRINK AND SERVE!</em></strong></p>

"<p>I remember days in the office that I was too busy to be bothered with rinsing the <a href=""http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/411FJQ559AL.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">filter</a> and just tapped it hard over a trash bin, do my best to get all the used ground out of there and brewed a new batch as usual. Is this okay, health-wise (surely flavour will be affected a bit) especially since I'm using it everyday, anyway?</p>

<p>Of course when I stop using my dripper for a while, there would be molds in the filter and that prompts me to soap and give it a hot bath. </p>
"
"<p>I made three batches in a row with a moka pot (for Vietnamese coffee ice cream!) recently. I did my best to handle things with a wet rag while still hot, but it was still a bit of a pain and a bit slow. Is there anything else I can do to speed things along or make it easier? Is it safe to just run water over it to fully cool it down?</p>
"
"<p>Looks like a standard metal mesh reusable filter! The mesh is probably stainless steel, perhaps with a gold-tinted coating, sandwiched between a plastic frame. They're alternatives to paper filters for filter/drip coffee. I find the outcome to be a little gritty/grainy; more like French press than a regular paper filter.</p>

<p>In general, if your filter is still performing well, I think <strong>you're probably fine with a shake-out, rinse, or occasional scrub</strong>. However, <strong>any residue might impart off-tastes in your next brew</strong> (hopefully what's left is just coffee remnants!). The leftover coffee stuck to your filter (that you didn't wash off) will oxidise, taste stale, etc. (See also <a href=""http://coffee.stackexchange.com/q/123/262"">this question about coffee going stale</a> -- one answer says it only takes minutes! And <a href=""http://coffee.stackexchange.com/q/160/262"">this question about what's happening</a> with stale coffee.)</p>

<p><strong>Wet coffee grounds will mould if allowed to sit too long</strong> as you report. So if you leave coffee in it, very wet, for a long time, you might be inviting flora and fauna that you don't want. You reported this in your question, but I'm surprised if it would happen very quickly. Clearly, when you have mould growing, you'll want to give it a good scrub. If you store your filter (grounds knocked out, even if not washed) in such a way that the filter can dry out more quickly (e.g., hanging, separate from the coffee maker, propped up to permit air flow, etc.) it seems that mould would have a harder time to grow.</p>

<p>As for getting clogged and occasionally needing a really thorough cleaning... I use a similar device for brewing tea, and it gets clogged sometimes. In fact, I wrote <a href=""http://cooking.stackexchange.com/a/51953/25286"">this question/answer on Cooking.SE</a> recently about how it had become clogged after a decade of use; see that for more on how to get such a metal mesh really clean.</p>

<p>A probably-obvious alternative is to use a paper filter. You could toss the whole thing into your compost bin (filter and spent grounds and all!) and everything on the coffee maker will dry out more quickly. </p>

"<p>Here's what I do:</p>

<li>Make your pot of coffee as normal: using boiling water</li>
<li>After you've made the coffee and poured it out, dunk the pot in the sink of cold water</li>
<li>It should cool down within a few seconds, allowing you to unscrew it, clean it out, and reset (it helps if you have a second sink to do the cleaning in)</li>
<li>Fill with coffee/boiling water again, and repeat until everyone has coffee</li>

"<p>I've heard that for a quality cup of aeropress coffee, one should be only using single origin coffees. I was wondering what the advantage of using single origin coffees was over espresso blends when brewing with an aeropress.    </p>
"
"<p>Besides the obvious <em>colour</em> difference: <strong>Is there any significant difference between using a brown (""natural"") paper filter, and a white (bleached or otherwise whitened) paper filter?</strong> That is: when all other factors are held constant; when used for drip, filter, pour-over, etc. brewing methods when using a paper filter.</p>

<p>The metrics that I can think of include the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Filtering <strong>performance</strong>. E.g., Do brown and white filters filter out the same ""stuff""? Do they permit the same rate of water flow? </li>
<li><strong>Flavor of result.</strong> E.g., Does one or the other impart off-flavours (e.g., leftovers from whitening, or <em>lack of whitening</em>)? Does does the resulting brewed coffee taste the same?</li>
<li><strong>Production / environmental issues.</strong> E.g., Does it take more energy to produce one or the other? Waste? Chemicals?</li>
</ul>

<p>I've tried to read up on this, and most sources seem to indicate that there's no significant difference; it reduces to personal preference, or off-hand environmental claims... but I see nothing concrete.</p>

<ul>
<li>Melitta says that <a href=""http://www.melitta.com/en/Why-We-Filter-1662.html"">they don't use chlorine bleach to whiten paper filters</a> instead using ""oxygen"" (which I take to actaully mean ""peroxide"", which may be less bad, but I'm not sure).

"<p>The answer is quite simply: It's up to your personal preference.</p>

<p>Lots of things make a good cup of espresso; some people like (or think they like) single origin expensive marketing-buzzword-infused coffees, and others have found other roasts / blends that work just as well for them. You can use whatever you want in your aeropress to make a cup of joe that suits you.</p>

<p>As <a href=""https://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/45007/what-are-the-recommended-coffee-roast-types-for-aeropress"">this question</a> on Seasoned Advise suggests, there are some objective measures we might look at. Since and Aeropress (disclaimer, I don't have one, but I have used them while backpacking quite a lot) tends to extract a lot of flavor, a medium roast will probably prevent your coffee from being too dark, and still provide a lot of flavor. You'll also want a nice fine grind, which is generally what you want for any espresso machine.</p>
"
"<p>99% of the coffee I drink is single origin since I roast my own and don't buy blends.  That being said I also have an Aeropress I use 2 or 3 times a week to make coffee (I use a drip machine or clever dripper the rest of the time).  What I have found is that any coffee I buy/roast that ISN'T recommended as a SO espresso tastes poor to me when brewed with my Aeropress.  I have solved this issue for myself by no longer buying beans that aren't recommended as a SO espresso.  </p>

<p>My untested hypothesis from this is that most coffees that would not do well as espresso will also not do well as aeropresso.  While the resulting coffee from an Aeropress is not espresso, the brew methods share enough in common and the results are similar enough (not the same, but similar) that they have (my opinion) quite a bit in common with what beans do well when brewed in that manner.</p>

<li>Use the whole fruit (possibly with seeds and all), so as to make a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit_preserves#Conserve"" rel=""nofollow"">conserve</a>;</li>
<li>Make something like a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit_preserves#Jam"" rel=""nofollow"">jam</a> or marmalade, using the shredded, dried, rehydrated husks;</li>
<li>Infuse the husks as <a href=""http://coffee.stackexchange.com/q/451/262"">cascara</a>, discard the spent husks, then make a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit_preserves#Jelly"" rel=""nofollow"">jelly</a> out of the resulting brew (tisane).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Exclusions.</strong> Note that I am <em>not</em> including <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_jelly"" rel=""nofollow"">coffee jelly</a>, which is made of (conventional, roasted) brewed coffee, as noted previously; also <em>not</em> including making a jam out of roasted or un-roasted coffee <em>beans</em> themselves. Both of those are interesting concepts, but discounted here to be left as separate topics.</p>

<p><strong>Progress!</strong> I searched a bunch for a source of <em>any</em> coffee cherries or dried husks. Amazon didn't even seem to sell any (must have been my error!?). I asked around at a few local coffee shops, with little progress. I found a few pages, <a href=""http://blog.kathrynmcgowan.com/tag/dried-coffee-cherries/"" rel=""nofollow"">like this one</a> and one from <a href=""http://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/11/11/grass-fed-pop-some-coffee-cherries"" rel=""nofollow"">a NYT blog</a> that gave a glimmer of hope that husks (at least) could be found. Both of those articles point to <a href=""https://counterculturecoffee.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Counter Culture Coffee</a> as selling these, but they're not in stock. An immensely helpful person from CCC pointed me to <a href=""http://www.vervecoffeeroasters.com/collections/coffee/products/cascara-coffee-cherry-tea"" rel=""nofollow"">Verve Coffee Roasters, who sell coffee cherry husks for cascara</a>. So as to get my lot before the rush on coffee cherry husks that would undoubtedly come from this post, I ordered some. Since I'm having trouble being patient and waiting for the stuff to arrive, I started...</p>

<p><strong>Seeking Seasoned Advice!</strong> With all due credit to OP @EricPlaton, I posted a question over at <a href=""http://cooking.stackexchange.com/"">Seasoned Advice</a> about the concept of <a href=""http://cooking.stackexchange.com/q/54942/25286"">making jam or preserves out of coffee cherry husks or whole coffee cherries</a>.

"<p>Here's an article by FastCompany whose author gives a day to day on Bulletproof. Also, watch the video of Joe Rogan which is included in the article.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.fastcompany.com/3034539/coffee-week/what-its-like-to-drink-bulletproof-coffee-every-morning-for-two-weeks"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""what it&#39;s like to drink bulletproof coffee"">what-its-like-to-drink-bulletproof-coffee-every-morning-for-two-weeks</a></p>

<p>There's a lot of misconceptions and snake oil used to entice you to buy the Bulletproof brand coffee, and by all reasonable accounts have been debunked or else not uncommon to just Bulletproof coffee.</p>

<p>Overall it's a gimmick; but that's not to say there's zero science behind it, but the science only seems to conclude that all the claims Bulletproof makes are complete bullshit.</p>

<p>Mycotoxins are NOT contained in the microbiota involved in the fermentation process of coffee. Mycotoxins are one of many of the by-products created by the microbiota from fermentation. These by-products are washed off from the bean during pre and post-fermentation processing (regardless of wet or dry processing), and even then are only in extremely minute amounts if not zero. Further, apparently the mycotoxins are made inert after the roasting process.</p>

<p>Bitterness in coffee can be a result of a few things. The roast itself, and the brewing. Roasting the coffee at higher temperatures (normal roasting temps are from 300-500F) and longer roast times, can add to the tannins that are perceived as bitter. Those tannins can then be extracted from the coffee if brewed for longer times and higher water temperatures.</p>
"
"<p>I suppose flavor won't be changed. Most coffee beans are grown <strong><em>just like that</em></strong>. They require shade or they will die of too much sunlight. Having too much water will sometimes drown the plant to death. Here is a <a href=""http://www.coffeehunter.com/articles/shade_grown_coffee_agronomist%E2%80%99s_perspective"" rel=""nofollow"">website</a> that lists three main disadvantages and some advantages to shade grown coffee.</p>

<ul>
<li>Too much shade will cause fungal infections</li>
</ul>

<p>If the plant is under too much shade, fungi-related infections will attack and feed on the plant. This will ruin your plant and destroy it. Yet having too much sunlight will burn the plant instead.</p>

<ul>
<li>The real definition of shade-grown is not really rock-solid. Many places will have varying amounts of shade due to their altitudes.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can't say that this type of shade gown plant is used in every country of different altitudes.. Some places require more shade (those with a high altitude) and others less shade (those with a low altitude). It depends on where you will plant your coffee plant.</p>

<ul>
<li>The further south (or, north) a farm is located from the Equator, the less need there is for shade cover to protect coffee plants from the rays of the sun: the strength of the sun's rays in, for example, Brazil (where the sun is at an angle) is far less than the direct overhead rays from Central America. Thus, while shade cover may prove advantageous in Central America it might actually lead to a fall in yield of crops in Brazil.</li>
</ul>

<p>This directly copied from the website, word for word. The amount of shade needed will also depends on the sunlight's strength. Nearer the equator, it is stronger so more shade is required. Farther from the equator, it is weaker so less shade is needed.</p>

<p>There are maybe more, but these are some basic and critical disadvantages to shad grown planting. I hope this helps you!  </p>

"<p>There are many difference between the two filters. In this <a href=""https://www.baltcoffee.com/content/whats-difference-between-brown-filters-and-white-filters"" rel=""nofollow"">website</a>. it states that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Today, most white paper filters are whitened with oxygen. Oxygen whitening is much more friendly to the environment, and imparts no taste to the filter. Brown filters are simply unwhitened. Your choice, but oxygen whitened filters are usually less expensive.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Brown filters are just plain without any improvements. Surprisingly, they are more expensive yet yields the same flavor as a white filter here. Trying to save money, get a white one.</p>

<h1>Speaking of Performance...</h1>

<p>In this <a href=""http://www.air-n-water.com/coffee-filters-information.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">website</a>,it states that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>Natural brown : In its natural form, all paper is brown colored, so brown filters are completely unprocessed. Other than aesthetics and processing, there are no other differences in color.</li>
  <li>White : White paper filters are processed to get that clean, white shade. Chlorine bleaching or natural oxygen bleaching are common methods for whitening paper. Generally, better quality paper ones do not use chlorine bleach.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Avoid white coffee filters that have been whitened with cholrine bleaching. These types of filters have a lower quality than natural brown or white ones using natural oxygen methods. Performance may vary though. Look online like in Amazon for high quality paper filters and look at the reviews.</p>

<h1>Taste</h1>

<p>Yep, some brown paper filters will add some extra taste to your coffee, sometimes not that good:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Melitta 'whites' are best. I use them, as they are oxygenated, not bleached. I don't care for any of the brown filters. I have used the Filtropa/Aroma (browns) and the Chemex and didn't care for them. Many brown filters introduce a wet cardboard taste into the brew. Hario is an exception but they are pricey.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Brown paper filters add a wet cardboard taste to your coffee. That just makes your coffee less enjoyable. As said in the performance section, white filters are probably better (if only implied with natural oxygen methods to get the white). Hario is a brown paper filter that acts like a white paper filter, adding no extra, disgusting flavor into your coffee. It is rather expensive though. Here is the <a href=""http://www.sweetmariascoffee.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=34&amp;t=833"" rel=""nofollow"">website</a> where all the information of this section came from.</p>

<h1>Environmental Impacts</h1>

<p>Well here is a paragraph about a study by Harvard about paper filters and such:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>According to Harvard Health Publications, paper filters are more effective at eliminating diterpenes than permanent or cloth filters. Paper filters are also easier to clean up -- you dispose of them after one use. Cloth and permanent filters must be cleaned after every use. Paper filters are not as environmentally friendly as the other types of filters, but since they’re made of natural fibers, they are biodegradable. To make paper filters more “green,” compost them along with your coffee grounds. For composting, natural brown filters are better than bleached white filters.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Paper filters aren't as eco-friendly as others but can are biodegradeable, unlike plastic which takes forever and metal, which probably takes even longer. Paper filters can even be used as compost with your coffee grounds. It will make good fertilizer with the rest of your compost. Using normal brown paper filters is preferred over bleached white filters. Production is nearly the same. A white paper filter is really a brown paper filter that is bleached or has added oxygen. Here is the <a href=""http://healthyeating.sfgate.com/benefits-using-coffee-filters-7625.html"" rel=""nofollow"">website</a> that provided the paragraph.</p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>

<p>Not a lot of differences that are outright clear, but there are minor differences between the two. I hope this helps you!</p>

"<p>In fact, it seems that people would drink both from the cup <em>and</em> from the saucer: After being served a hot beverage (e.g., coffee or tea) in a cup on top of a saucer, some would pour a small amount of the beverage onto the saucer, and then drink from the saucer. There's evidence that this was reasonably common into the 20th century, and evidence that some still do, for a variety of possible reasons! Though I've never seen this practice in person, the following is what I have aggregated from a bit of online searching.</p>

<p>A <a href=""http://organon.jimhufford.com/2010/03/things-ive-always-wondered-about-cooling-saucer-edition/"">blog post</a> contains some good links about the topic. I find the most compelling of them to be an article that discusses <a href=""http://www.americancenturies.mass.edu/classroom/curriculum_12th/unit3/lesson8/bkgdessay.html"">the use of <em>deep</em> saucers</a> for this practice; the saucer is larger and deeper like a shallow bowl, alleviating some of the awkward logistical aspects of drinking from a flat or shallow saucer. Another anecdote, <a href=""http://www.senate.gov/legislative/common/briefing/Senate_legislative_process.htm"">according to US government legend</a>, George Washington (in a discussion with Thomas Jefferson) used the literal practice (cooling-off beverages in a saucer) as a metaphor for the cooling-off that occurs in the upper house of a bicameral legislature. Even if this exact exchange is embellished, it still suggests that the practice was common enough to be in the vernacular.</p>

<p>Fundamentally, pouring part of a hot beverage into a saucer would help cool it down faster. Many anecdotal sources have that as an assumed motivation; if you're in a hurry to start drinking your beverage (and are a bit careful about the pouring and the saucer-sipping) it's a practical way of doing so. Some other anecdotes suggest that it was fashionable or polite (maybe even fun?) -- perhaps like <a href=""http://resources.woodlands-junior.kent.sch.uk/customs/behaviourfood.html"">eating peas off the back of one's fork</a>. Cooling a portion in the saucer would alleviate the need for potentially-impolite-seeming slurping or blowing across the beverage to cool it, substituting instead acrobatic-prowess-demonstrating yet possibly-more-polite sipping off of a saucer.  Other discussion forums (<a href=""http://aforum.genealogi.se/discus/messages/2450/91396.html?1269309231"">one example</a>) contain some additional anecdotes and pictures.</p>

"<p>I often buy pre-roasted beans so that they last longer in storage. This means I have to grind the beans.</p>

<p>I have a cheap spice grinder that does a great job at preparing the beans into ground coffee. It is easy to use, takes 5-15 seconds to process half a dozen cups worth of beans, and I have  good control over how fine a powder to make the beans into. I'm pretty sure this is a similar story for almost everyone with an electric grinder.</p>

<p>I saw a friend using a hand grinder. It took far longer and from what I saw there was <strong>no discernable difference</strong> between hand ground coffee and machine ground coffee <strong>in terms of texture</strong>  <em>(if anything the texture was less consistent when hand ground)</em>.</p>

<p>Given this, why on earth would anyone want to hand grind?</p>
"
"<p>Hand grinders will work without electricity.  </p>

<p>You can generally get a conical hand grinder cheaper than you can get an electric one.  </p>

<p>They also create less noise than a electric grinder.</p>

<p>Hand grinders will generally produce less heat than an electric (may affect bean flavor).</p>

<p>Many grinders are lighter and smaller than electric ones. They are portable and can easily be packed for use when traveling.</p>

<p>As to the consistency, a conical grinder (electric or manual) will generally create a more consistent grind than a electric blade ""grinder"".  Electric blade grinders tend to produce dust and boulders.  I know because I use one at work daily and I can see the inconsistency in the grind, but it doesn't bother me that much.  At home, my burr grinder creates a much more consistent grind.</p>

"<p>When brewing Turkish coffee in a cezve, it's generally recommended to fill with water up to the neck of the pot. Is it alright to use a bigger cezve (say, a double one) for making less coffee (e.g., a single demitasse)?</p>

<p>My guess is that the problem, if any, would relate to the fact that the water surface should be up in the cezve's narrow neck. A related question, therefore, is: does the narrowing-to-the-top shape of the cezve effect the brewing, and in particular, crema formation?</p>
"
"<p>I'm going to start by answering your last question first just for fun. In this <a href=""http://ineedcoffee.com/brewing-espresso-in-a-moka/"" rel=""nofollow"">site</a>, it says that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Place the pot over a low flame. A low flame increases the brew time, which enhances the flavor. At a later step, you’ll want a slow trickle of espresso instead of a full-force fountain.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You would want a nice, long brew time. The flavor will be enhanced rather than the quick brew time with a large fire. So flavor and brew time can be changed depending on the size of your heat. To answer that question, <strong><em>YES</em></strong> it is a great idea to turn down the heat. <strong>EXTRA</strong>: The site also shows how to make a nice moka (not spam)! Second, you really answered your last question yourself. Low heat is better than high heat.</p>

<p>Now I'm going to answer your second question. Looks like this <a href=""http://whatscookingamerica.net/Beverage/MokaEspressoPot.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">site</a> uses Italian pots just like your induction hob. For stovetop pots and not stovepot pots, it says that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When the water in the tank has been exhausted, that's when you hear the ‘gurgle’ that signifies the drink is ready to pour (approximately 4 to 5 minutes).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Looks like 4 to 5 minutes is just the right time for the coffee to be ready for extraction here. You should know the sound of someone using mouthwash and gurgling. The coffee pot will start to produce that sound when coffee is ready.</p>

<p>Now I will answer your first question. I can't seem to find any significant information on your question, so I'll take a shot at it. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Supposedly, it might be your decision. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Maybe some people like this setting while others like another. I don't know what your standards for a good brew is so I'll just say that you should choose it. Sorry for the lack of information! I hope this answer answered all your questions!</p>
"
"<p>Your first question's answer: <strong><em>YOU MUST USE A FILTER!</em></strong> How do you think you can make good, quality coffee on any coffee-maker without a filter? It lets the good stuff go through and keeps the bad stuff out (if it is high-quality or just decent enough).</p>

<p>Your second question. So siphons so use metal filters, but they are either rare or even not produced anymore. Your cloth description is right:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A piece of cloth can however get dirty, rough, etc.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>if you don't know when or how to clean it. In good quality plus cleaning, they can be used up to 100 times or even more. In this <a href=""http://coffeegeek.com/guides/siphoncoffee"" rel=""nofollow"">site</a> (which states all types of filters and how to change them), it says that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My cleaning regimen for cloth filters has changed over the years. Cloth filter assemblies should be cleaned right after use with a soft brush and running water, and then soaked in a solution of oxyclean and boiling water. Rinse well after, and store dry. 
  This will not harm the cloth like bleach will, and it comes out sparkling white and odor free.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oxyclean is a product that is like washing detergent. Cleans up cloth and fabric quickly and nicely, bringing out good results. Boiling water will help out with the cleaning and disinfecting of the cloth. It will literally burn and kill any harmful bacteria on your cloth. You should clean the cloth immediately after use. This will keep the cloth in top-shape for a <em>long</em> time in its ""life"" span.</p>

<p>Paper filters' cleaning ways are obvious. One use and they are thrown right into the trash. You really can't clean paper filters.</p>

<p>Cleaning glass filters (in my opinion) should be cleaned right after used. They are pretty rare and easily broken when not receiving enough care. Just clean it like any other glass product. Put water on a paper towel and wipe it clean.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The rough (but not sharp) surface of the middle was the filter - coffee grounds would get trapped in the little channels between the bumps, but liquid would still pass through. In practice, these glass filters allow a fair amount of sediment to pass into the brewed coffee. Some find this beneficial, others do not.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The choice of using this filter is your decision depending on what you want from your filter.</p>

<p>Nylon mesh are easily cleaned: they're dishwasher safe. Yet, they are breakable and fragile at the same time. Be careful with these guys.</p>

<p>I hope this helps you and answers your questions!</p>
"
"<p>In short: <strong>Using a cezve of the correct size works better.</strong> The situation is similar to using appropriate equipment size in other coffee preparation methods (other examples at the bottom).  That said, you can probably brew a passable cup of <a href=""http://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/483/difference-between-turkish-and-greek-coffee"">Turkish (or other names)</a> coffee when your <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cezve"" rel=""nofollow"">cezve</a> isn't full to the neck (or, using a cezve that's ""too large""). </p>

<p>However, there are reasons for the shape and size of a cezve (as you suggest in your question), and it really does help in practice:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>The narrower neck of the cezve keeps the foam form.</strong> I haven't found any good references for an explanation; more discussion below.</li>
<li><strong>It's easier to see what's happening.</strong> Using a bigger pot, it would be more difficult to see when the boiling/foaming is happening. Some stir it down during brewing, some don't; either way, timing is important!</li>
</ul>

<p>There are a bunch of brewing guides that suggest reasons; <a href=""http://www.howtobrewcoffee.com/Turkish.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">this one</a>  suggests stirring down several times, and says the size is due to <strong>""physics""</strong> without explanation; <a href=""http://drinks.seriouseats.com/2013/01/how-to-make-turkish-coffee-at-home-in-an-ibrik-instructions-tips-technique-coffee-brewing.html"" rel=""nofollow"">here's another</a>. <a href=""http://coffeegeek.com/guides/turkishcoffee"" rel=""nofollow"">This one from CoffeeGeek</a> suggests that the shape (narrowing toward the top) helps <strong>to prevent the foam from burning to the side of the pot</strong> (becoming bitter); this makes sense especially when using a small pot on a gas stove, when the heat will try to hug the sides of the pot. And <a href=""http://www.freshcup.com/brewing-turkish/"" rel=""nofollow"">this one</a> doesn't say to stir. All of them suggest, but none that I could find explicitly <em>state</em> the reason why the foam forms better.  In a pinch, I have tried to make Turkish coffee in a regular handled pan; it simply doesn't work as well. Something magical happens in the neck of a cezve to help that delicious foam to form; the best I can figure is that it's fragile, and the narrower neck somehow helps concentrate the bubbles, helps keep the foam together, and keeps it from collapsing. </p>

<p>Other examples of equipment size mattering when you're making coffee with other methods:</p>

<ul>
<li>Moka pot. The size of the pot determines how much you brew at a time; can't really make more or less (though you <a href=""http://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/1519/how-should-i-make-multiple-batches-quickly-with-a-moka-pot"">could brew a few pots in a row</a>). See also <a href=""/questions/tagged/moka"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged 'moka'"" rel=""tag"">moka</a>.</li>
<li>Espresso. Though you can make a single or double, and a <a href=""http://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/408/what-is-the-difference-between-a-long-luongo-and-a-short-ristretto-shot-of-e"">long or short</a>, you pretty much have to <a href=""http://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/415/how-do-i-know-when-to-stop-pulling-my-shot/"">stop pulling at the right time</a>.</li>
<li>Cone filter. For example, #2 and #4 and #6 coffee filters exist for a reason: it's hard to get a good pour of a 12-cup carafe of drip/filter coffee through a #2 filter; it's just too small.</li>
</ul>
"
"<p>Questions related or is about the different bean types should have this tag. Questions that have this tag should also have a specific problem needing to be solved about a certain type of coffee bean in a certain situation like:</p>

Dricka på fat (drink from a plate, i.e. saucer) can be combined with dricka på bit (drink with a lump, i.e. lump of sugar). You take the lump of sugar between your teeth and sip your coffee (from the saucer) through the sugar. 
  Neither of these customs are, however, common in polite society... And, generally speaking, I've only ever seen older people do it, years ago, and in the countryside. 
  Today's urban and international Swedes are more likely to have a latte - without sugar - in a tall glass, no saucer. </p>

<p>Well, you shouldn't do this in public - it's impolite. You could do it alone in the privacy of your house though. @hoc_age got this part right:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In fact, it seems that people would drink both from the cup and from the saucer: After being served a hot beverage (e.g., coffee or tea) in a cup on top of a saucer, some would pour a small amount of the beverage onto the saucer, and then drink from the saucer. There's evidence that this was reasonably common into the 20th century, and evidence that some still do, for a variety of possible reasons! </p>

<p>This pretty much explains this abnormal Swedish tradition. Yep, the fact you stated is true. The Swedish did it back in the olden days. I hope this helps you!</p>

"<p>When grinding coffee, the particle size of the resulting powder can be described with a bell curve, whose width (and thus, the powder consistency) varies on mostly the roast and the grinding method. A manual grinder with adjustable grinding size will produce a more consistence powder, whereas electric grinders (especially the cheaper household ones) will provide you with a wider curve with less guaranteed consistency.</p>

<p>The roast however has a much smaller say in the consistency, but beans roasted darker may tend to give you a bit more percentage of fine powder as the beans dry out more and become more fragile.</p>

<p>And I won't even mention how the manual grinding can become part of someone's morning workout routine...</p>

"<p>I've typically used the same cloth filter on a hario syphon for several (2 - 3 probably) months of continuous use (1 or 2 syphons daily). We clean the cloth after each use using a mild detergent, hot water and a soft scrubbing brush. Rinse very well after each wash. Typically, after a week or so we soak the cloth in oxyclean or similar for a couple of hours to get it super clean and then follow this up with a normal wash and thorough rinse. The coffee <strong>will</strong> stain the cloths after the first use, so don't expect it to return to the same colour it was originally no matter how often or well you wash it.</p>

<p>When we first bought a syphon about five years ago we were recommended to store the filter in a glass jar of water in the fridge to prevent it drying out between uses. If we aren't planning to use the filter for a while, we toss the cloth, clean the metal part and let it dry.</p>

<p>You can also clean the filter (with or without the cloth) in the dishwasher but I'd still recommend giving it a thorough rinse afterwards.</p>

<p>The cloths are fairly cheap and in my experience easy to find online so use your judgement - if you think it's time to switch cloths, it's probably time to use a new cloth!</p>

"<p>I have never bothered to rinse my paper coffee filters before use, but some strongly recommend this. I did some experiments, outlined below, to test this. <strong>I don't find rinsing makes any difference,</strong> but there might be benefit that I don't understand.</p>

<p><strong>My questions,</strong> in sum:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>What's the best way to rinse a paper filter?</strong> Inside, outside, both? Soak? Hot or cold water?</li>
<li><strong>How does it help?</strong> </li>
<li>Bonus: <strong>What is being rinsed off?</strong> Are loose bits of paper really coming off the filter?</li>
</ul>

<p>Of the many articles about this, most of them simply point to <a href=""http://drinks.seriouseats.com/2011/10/coffee-filters-you-should-clean-them-coffee-technique.html"">this Serious Eats article</a> (e.g., <a href=""http://lifehacker.com/5855965/rinse-your-coffee-filters-for-a-cleaner-better-tasting-cup-of-coffee"">lifehacker</a> and <a href=""http://www.thekitchn.com/is-rinsing-your-159436"">the kitchn</a> don't have much more content; others are chat/discussions without concrete conclusions or references). That article says <em>rinsing removes ""dusty stuff""</em> from the filter (that suggests that there's off-tastes from the paper dust), and rinsing also <em>helps reduce clogging</em> of filter pores (presumably also from the ""dusty stuff""). </p>

<p>The quality of the paper filter certainly matters; comments and responses to <a href=""http://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/1524/how-do-brown-and-white-paper-filters-compare"">this question</a> support that. I buy the cheapest brown filters available, so I think it's unlikely that my filters ""don't need rinsing"" or so, but perhaps they're so cheap as to ""not benefit from rinsing."" <a href=""http://landofathousandhills.com/fromtheroastmaster/why-you-should-rinse-your-paper-filter-before-brewing/"">This article</a> suggests some filter taste-tests, so I did them and more. </p>

<p><strong>My experiments:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I poured water through rinsed and non-rinsed filters and tasted the water that went through the filter. Both taste faintly of paper, but I see no difference;</li>
<li>I have brewed simultaneous batches with rinsed and non-rinsed; I taste exactly no difference;</li>
<li>I have even gone so far as to chew on rinsed and non-rinsed paper filters to see if I could tell a difference. (<strong>Edit:</strong> to be clear, I chewed on these filters only to see if I taste a difference between rinsed and non-rinsed paper filters, <em>not</em> to somehow ""condition"" the filter before brewing use)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>My conclusions:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Paper filters taste terrible</strong> -- mine anyway -- rinsed or not. I may have to revisit <a href=""http://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/1524/how-do-brown-and-white-paper-filters-compare"">this question on brown versus white filters</a>, buy better paper filters, or use a <a href=""http://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/434/how-does-nel-drip-compare-to-paper-filtered-pour-over"">cloth-filtered Nel pot</a>.</li>
<li><strong>I wasted a lot of filters doing these tests</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<p>In fact, after using a pre-rinsed filter I got a ""structural failure"" -- the bottom of the filter broke -- when brewing pour-over with a heavily rinsed filter. I'll probably have to eat some better-quality or white paper filters to make this fair.</p>

<p>In sum, my only conclusion is that <strong>quickly rinsing the inside <em>and</em> outside</strong> of the filter is the only way for this to have any benefit. I'm discounting any other benefit of pre-rinsing, such as rinsing with hot water would warm ceramic cone filter-holder or pot/mug.</p>

"<p>Most coffee shops sell biscotti to have with your coffee. I've always wondered, is there a 'correct' way of consuming them together? Are biscotti ideally consumed with a certain preparation of coffee (e.g. a capuccino but not a latte)? Should I be dunking, or is that frightfully uncultured?</p>

<p>The soft, cookie-like biscotti available in many cafes won't hold up to any dunking at all, and will end up waterlogged and sad at the end of your sipping.

I prefer the <a href=""http://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/9256/how-to-make-softer-biscotti"">middle-of-the-road, softer, chewy biscotti</a> that can be enjoyed without submerging in liquid.</p>

<p>At the risk of this becoming an opinion-based discussion, for my money: <strong>If you want to drink coffee, just drink coffee.  If you want to eat a soggy cookie, eat a soggy cookie... but don't combine the two</strong> and risk ruining your perfectly good coffee in the process. :)</p>

"<p>There actually is a scientific equation for determining how long and at what angle to dunk something in coffee. Len Fisher won the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ig_Nobel_Prize"" rel=""nofollow"">Ig Nobel</a> in Physics for working out the equation in his paper ""How to Dunk a Biscuit"". He is British, so in my American copy of his book the paper is titled ""How to Dunk a Doughnut"" but the equations he works out would also suit biscotti.</p>

<p>A lot of it comes down to the makeup of the biscotti you are eating. As @hoc_age mentioned some store ""biscotti"" are just kinda hard cookies and some are teeth-breaking dense blocks. Using Len Fisher's equations though you could determine how long you could dunk the biscotti to soften it up without it collapsing into and ruining your coffee.</p>

<p>In the end I agree with @hoc_age, defend your coffee from invasion but to each his own, at least science has an answer!</p>

<p>I know quotes are better than links but I can't find a public source of the paper and it would be too long to post here.

"<p>Using science to brew the ""perfect coffee"" is still fairly subjective...</p>

<p>Each scientist may be able to brew, to their own palate, a perfect cup. But palates being what they are, each cup and each method would be different.</p>

<p>The alternative would be to run a series of trials with focus groups to see which coffees tested ""best"". And here danger lies...</p>

<p>Arguably some of the worst coffee ever produced came from coffee manufactures and retailers using the focus group method.

<p>I would really encourage you to watch the whole talk but here's an excerpt that makes the point pretty well:</p>

<p>About 15 minutes in...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And the reason we thought that -- in other words, people in the
  cooking world were looking for cooking universals. They were looking
  for one way to treat all of us. And it's good reason for them to be
  obsessed with the idea of universals, because all of science, through
  the 19th century and much of the 20th, was obsessed with universals.
  Psychologists, medical scientists, economists were all interested in
  finding out the rules that govern the way all of us behave. But that
  changed, right? What is the great revolution in science of the last
  10, 15 years? It is the movement from the search for universals to the
  understanding of variability. Now in medical science, we don't want to
  know how necessarily -- just how cancer works, we want to know how
  your cancer is different from my cancer. I guess my cancer different
  from your cancer. Genetics has opened the door to the study of human
  variability. What Howard Moskowitz was doing was saying, this same
  revolution needs to happen in the world of tomato sauce. And for that,
  we owe him a great vote of thanks.</p>
  
  <p>I'll give you one last illustration of variability, and that is
  -- oh, I'm sorry. Howard not only believed that, but he took it a second step, which was to say that when we pursue universal principles
  in food, we aren't just making an error; we are actually doing
  ourselves a massive disservice. And the example he used was coffee.
  And coffee is something he did a lot of work with, with Nescafe. If I
  were to ask all of you to try and come up with a brand of coffee -- a
  type of coffee, a brew -- that made all of you happy, and then I asked
  you to rate that coffee, the average score in this room for coffee
  would be about 60 on a scale of 0 to 100. If, however, you allowed me
  to break you into coffee clusters, maybe three or four coffee
  clusters, and I could make coffee just for each of those individual
  clusters, your scores would go from 60 to 75 or 78. The difference
  between coffee at 60 and coffee at 78 is a difference between coffee
  that makes you wince, and coffee that makes you deliriously happy.</p>

"<p>I recently received <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B0009MZ67Q"">a new device</a> for making cold brew coffee. It put out a really good cold brew. The filter is made out of a fine nylon mesh.</p>

<p>How coarsely (or finely) should the coffee be ground for best cold-brew extraction?</p>
"
"<p>Let's answer your first question first:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What's the best way to rinse a paper filter? Inside, outside, both? Soak? Hot or cold water?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can't really rinse <strong><em>only</em></strong> the outside/inside of a paper filter. When you drop water on a piece of paper, it doesn't just stick onto the outside/inside, it soaks <strong><em>both</em></strong> sides of the paper filter. So, both sides. You probably want to soak your filter. This will get rid of any unnecessary chemicals and oils filtered from your filter. This will help make your coffee taste better. Your Serious Eats article is <strong><em>very</em></strong> accurate. Well, soaking in hot water should do. Hot water will might peal off some paper plus a lot of harmful stuff. It is one-kill wonder for bacteria. The hot water will burn your harmful bacteria to death. So answering your first question: Both, Yes, Hot Water</p>

<p>Now let's answer your second question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How does it help?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, filters are needed to keep coffee clean by extracting and ""keeping"" the chemicals and oils. Then, what cleans the filters? This is where rinsing comes in. Let me show you an example. Your clothes keep you clean then you put them in the washing machine to get them clean. So the rinsing is just like the washing machine. Over time, the paper will absorb so many chemicals and oils, the performance goes down like a rock. Some trapped chemicals will join the coffee, allowing the coffee to be contaminated and less tasty. Rinsing will allow the hot water to kill the bacteria and let the filter transfer the chemicals to the water, where it will belong somewhere in a sewer. This will leave the filter very clean.</p>

<p>And now I will answer your bonus question (Do you award extra rep for this ;-)?): </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What is being rinsed off?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, the chemicals and oils of course! As said in my previous answer, the water will take the chemicals and oils to the sewer with it. The pores in which the filter needs to cleanse are then empty and more useful. Paper sometimes peel off but will end in the sewer like the chemicals and the water. After one use, it is time for the trash. Of course, first-timers will have to learn that dust and other particles will also ruin the flavor and filter. That is really the ""dusty stuff"".</p>

<h1>Bonus Information About Your Experiments:</h1>

<p>Looks like they don't work. Sure, most coffee filters will add a papery taste to your coffee, depending on its quality. First, doing the first experiment doesn't really do anything. You need to add coffee, not water, to see a difference. An bad, uncleaned filter will add a papery taste plus some more unwanted taste into your coffee. A good, rinsed filter will add a tiny papery taste to your coffee. Adding something in which it has flavor will make the experiment more fun (a lot more coffee to taste) and effective. That also goes to your second experiment which almost is the first experiment itself for some reason... Anyways, chewing paper filters will <strong>absolutely</strong> not do anything. All that does is leave you complaining and spitting for the next 12 hours. You might need a mint and some mouthwash after that for personal hygiene reasons :-).</p>

"All about the flavour of coffee: e.g., the nature of flavour, chemical components, impact of extraction techniques on the resulting flavour."
"<p>Two guides do have specific (though differing!) recommendations on coarseness of grind for cold brew. </p>

<ul>
<li>Blue Bottle recommends <a href=""https://bluebottlecoffee.com/preparation-guides/cold-brew"" rel=""nofollow"">a grind <strong>a bit finer</strong> than paper-filtered drip coffee</a> (they compare it to the same grind as for AeroPress); they're using an immersion setup with a wool filter. </li>
<li>Kicking Horse recommends <a href=""http://www.kickinghorsecoffee.com/en/blog/how-make-cold-brew-coffee"" rel=""nofollow"">a <strong>medium-coarse</strong> grind</a>, nearly like that of French press; they are using a similar setup but claim that a finer grind extracts more bitter compounds. </li>
</ul>

<p>Personally, I use the latter because I find the filtering goes more easily with a coarser grind; see also <a href=""http://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/431/how-can-i-make-filtering-my-cold-brew-easier"">this question about making cold brew easier to filter</a>.</p>

"<p>With due credit to @Roland for <a href=""http://coffee.stackexchange.com/q/1557/262"">his questions</a>, I peeled off a related topic into a new question.</p>

<p>With any preparation, roast level is a bit of personal preference. However, certain roasts are more common or <em>generally</em> taste better with certain preparations (cf., ""espresso roast"" or so).</p>

<p>How about for cold brew? Aside from personal preference, <strong>is there something about cold brew that lends itself to better extraction with a certain roast level?</strong></p>

<p>For example, <strong>a medium roast is recommended</strong> in both <a href=""https://bluebottlecoffee.com/preparation-guides/cold-brew"">the cold-brew guide from Blue Bottle</a> and <a href=""http://www.kickinghorsecoffee.com/en/blog/how-make-cold-brew-coffee"">the guide from Kicking Horse</a>.</p>

<p>As noted in the Kicking Horse link above, cold brew will generally produce a lower-acid result (i.e., than the same coffee prepared by other methods). Generally speaking, lighter roasts will have <em>higher</em> acid content. The combination of these two seems to suggest (to me, anyway) to the conclusion that one can use lighter roasts for cold brew (i.e., lighter than you might otherwise enjoy).</p>

<p><strong>Is there a good reason to use medium (or lighter roasts) with cold-brew?</strong> Or, alternatively: <strong>Is there some reason to <em>not</em> use dark roasts with cold-brew?</strong></p>

"<p>Though I don't generally like to cite Wikipedia as my primary reference, it <em>does</em> in this case have a pretty good overview of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_extraction"" rel=""nofollow"">terms related to coffee extraction</a>, re-summarized here:</p>

<p><strong><em>Extraction:</em></strong>
<br><strong>The <em>amount of the original mass</em> of the grounds that ends up in the brewed coffee</strong>. Though it certainly depends on the preparation method (""method of extraction"", e.g., drip, moka, espresso, cold-brew, ...), the recommended extraction amount is <strong>about 20%</strong> (i.e., about 20% of the mass of the beans/grounds ends up in the brewed coffee). </p>

<p><strong>Less than ~15%-18% extraction is considered ""under-extracted"" and can be sour.</strong> That is, under-extraction is not just a matter of inefficiency: the result can be sour and unbalanced due to the fact that acids are extracted quickly. On the other hand, <strong>more than ~22%-25% extraction is considered ""over-extracted"" and can be bitter</strong>, because the bitter compounds are extracted later in the brewing process.  </p>

<p>These figures were generated by groups with lofty-sounding names like the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specialty_Coffee_Association_of_America"" rel=""nofollow"">Specialty Coffee Association of America</a>, the <a href=""http://www.scaa.org/chronicle/2013/10/04/the-coffee-brewing-institute/"" rel=""nofollow"">Coffee Brewing Institute</a>, and the <a href=""http://www.espressoitaliano.org"" rel=""nofollow"">Italian Espresso National Institute</a>. Also known as ""solubles yield."" See also <a href=""http://www.coffeecuppers.com/Espresso.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">this article</a> on espresso extraction.</p>

<p><strong><em>Strength:</em></strong>
<br><strong>The <em>concentration</em> of the extracted compounds in the water.</strong> Basically, how much coffee is in the water per unit (volume or mass).</p>

<p>As noted in the question, there are also colloquial or vernacular uses of these terms (e.g., ""strength"" as relative flavour profile; ""extraction"" as the process of brewing, etc.) but the above seem to be the accepted tangible definitions of the terms.</p>
"
"<p>I use a moka pot (makineta) to make coffee, and I keep the beans in a bag (not sealed) in the freezer.</p>

<p>I keep getting people saying that in order to get to best aroma and the most fresh coffee the beans must be kept in vacuum after roasting until use, and due to this fact there is no escape but using the sealed Nespresso capsules and their machine (or any other capsule espresso machine equivalent).</p>

<p>How much does it matter? How much of the aroma/freshness is lost if the beans are not kept in vacuum? (but are being ground only prior to making a cup)</p>

"<p>Questions about the temperature of coffee. This involves factors that can be changed or be determined by the temperature.

"More than just the amount of heat energy contained in coffee: from extraction to serving, temperature has myriad effects on the quality and flavour of the resulting beverage."
"<p>Coffee beans are freshest from about 12 to 48 hours after roasting until maybe one or two weeks later when stored properly in an airtight container.  During the early portion of this period (immediately after roasting to three or four days later) beans will be still giving off some gases, thus the reason for one way valves on coffee bags.  That being the case, vaccuum sealing can extend that time some, but not indefinitely.  Storing your coffee in the freezer actually makes the problem worse since the freeze thaw cycle drys the beans out and forces the oils to separate out of the beans.</p>

"<p>I was on this <a href=""http://www.air-n-water.com/coffee-makers-101.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">website</a> which states that there are four main types of coffee makers:</p>

<p>So my question is, do each of these have a certain filter you have to use with them or can they use multiple types?</p>

"<p>Lots of people use lots of filters for drip- or filter-brewed coffee. Some use paper and others use these durable filters. The performance to me is the same but many people argue that.

"<p>When I use an espresso coffee pod, I'm a little skeptical that it qualifies as real espresso.

<p>It does come out very strong, and with a decent amount of crema, but is it actually espresso?</p>

"<p>Akin to the simultaneous fates of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schroedinger&#39;s_cat"">Schrödinger's Cat</a>, answers to your question include <strong><em>no</em></strong>, <strong><em>maybe</em></strong>, and <strong><em>it doesn't matter</em></strong>. I have furthermore been unable to avoid philosophical diversion and hypothetical questions in this answer; please forgive me. :)</p>

<p>As @EricPlaton noted in comments, the answer depends on a slightly different question: <strong>What characteristics define real espresso?</strong> Here I merely compare the beverages produced by the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>a <em>traditional espresso machine</em> (See <a href=""http://sydney.edu.au/engineering/it/~bob/Coffee/timeline.html"">this history of espresso machines and production techniques</a> for one view of what is <em>traditionally</em> espresso), and </li>
<li><em>capsule-based ""espresso"" systems</em>. There are several capsule-based espresso machines (<a href=""http://www.coffeereview.com/three-new-capsule-espresso-systems/"">here's a review of Nespresso and three others</a>). You place a small coffee-filled capsule (a.k.a. ""pod"", made of aluminium, plastic, paper-wrapped, compressed puck, or other material) into the machine and press a button; seconds later it produces a coffee beverage. </li>
</ul>

<p>My answers:</p>

<h2>No.</h2>

<p>In simple point of fact, <strong>espresso is not <em>traditionally</em> made with a coffee-filled capsule</strong>, so the beverage produced by capsule-based machines might be disqualified from being called espresso on that trivial issue alone. :)</p>

<p>If you subscribe to the <a href=""http://www.espressoitaliano.org/en/The-Certified-Italian-Espresso.html"">INEI</a> being a benchmark of <a href=""http://www.espressoitaliano.org/files/File/istituzionale_inei_hq_en.pdf"">espresso production standards (PDF)</a>, <strong>capsule systems may not meet INEI parameters... so if they don't, they're not an espresso on technicality alone</strong>, with regard to ""Certified Italian Espresso"" at least. For example: </p>

<ol>
<li>quantity of coffee (e.g., <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nespresso"">Nespresso might be light</a>); </li>
<li>hot water should be used for espresso (some do use pressurized water; but it's not INEI espresso if the capsule system uses steam); </li>
<li>Some capsule systems (as noted by @EricPlaton below) <em>do</em> produce espresso-machine pressures, but there could be benefit (or problems) by <a href=""http://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/296/downsides-of-brewing-espresso-with-high-pressure"">using pressure that is too high</a>, or on the other hand <a href=""http://coffee.stackexchange.com/a/1563/262"">too low</a> for extraction and crema. That said, <a href=""http://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/58/whats-the-most-effective-way-of-generating-crema-from-an-aeropress"">it seems that AeroPress can create crema</a> at lower pressures, so perhaps the capsule systems produce a beverage more like AeroPress than espresso.[1]</li>
</ol>

<h2>Maybe.</h2>

<p>There have been several taste-tests of questionable ""legitimacy"" between capsule-based machines and traditional espresso machines. <a href=""http://aeon.co/magazine/culture/julian-baggini-coffee-artisans/"">One four-subject test</a> gave <em>higher marks</em> to the beverage produced from a capsule-based machine than a traditional espresso machine. <a href=""http://www.airtightinteractive.com/2008/09/starbucks-versus-nespresso-taste-test/"">This one</a> agrees. Another test disagreed, <a href=""http://www.lifehacker.com.au/2013/04/nespresso-coffee-overpriced-rubbish/"">giving a capsule-based machine a scathing review</a>. Maybe there are better reviews out there; these are mostly useful for anecdotes.</p>

<p>As you note, the resulting beverage from a capsule-based espresso system is similar to traditional espresso, crema and all. However, if you ordered an espresso from a proper cafe, and they gave you a beverage that was brewed using a capsule-based machine, would you feel cheated on principle? What if the beverage was indistinguishable from traditional espresso... or if you like the capsule-based system's result better?</p>

<h2>It doesn't matter.</h2>

<p>This is my personal conclusion. The result of the beverage produced by a capsule-based system is a decent replica of proper espresso. Capsule systems also are likely to produce a <em>consistent</em> result. If you like the beverage that results (see above...), <strong>what difference does it make if it's <em>""real""</em> espresso or not?</strong></p>

<p><sub>[1] Is AeroPress espresso? I think not (and @Chris in AK agreed and notes ""Aerpresso"" in comments!), but that's a separate question also...</sub></p>
"
"<p>I buy 2-3 bags of fresh roasted beans and after a few days the bags balloon out. Should I squeeze the gases out or let the gases seep out naturally? </p>
"
"<p>It doesn't actually matter!</p>

<p>The valve on the bag is there to let gas out without letting gas in. The reason for this is that freshly roasted beans will continue to give off a bit of CO2 for a little while. Coffee that's packaged immediately after roasting will give off a bit in the bag, hence the need for a valve.</p>

<p>Oxygen causes coffee to go off, which is why we keep our coffee in airtight containers to preserve it as long as possible. It's why the valve on the bag is designed to prevent air from the outside getting in.</p>

<p>The CO2 that's accumulating in the bags is essentially inert, and won't cause the coffee beans to go off. It makes no difference whether you squeeze it out or not!</p>
"
"<h2>My 2 cents:</h2>

<p>I've been doing an alt. version of Bulletproof Coffee for about 2 yrs and have had good results. For my version, I use freshly roasted beans from my local farmer's market (they roast on site), Coconut Oil, and Stevia as a sweetener. I also use a <a href=""http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/10076320/"" rel=""nofollow"">mini aerator</a> from ikea ($2.49) to mix it. This is very important unless you like an oily film on top of your coffee.</p>

<p>I use organic Coconut Oil rather than Grass fed butter for two reasons: 
 1. Coconut Oil is much easier for me to find
 2. IMO, it tastes better than the butter</p>

<p>I tried the grass fed butter, and it was pretty good, but like I said. The coconut oil is much easier to find in stores and it actually tastes better. The butter does give the coffee a creamy texture that's good though, so I'd try both just to see which one you like better. I tried the MCT oil for a while and noticed that it can be a tad harsh on my digestive system, so I cut it. </p>

<p>As for results, in addition to having a significant boost in energy in the AM, I also noticed health benefits. My good cholesterol (HDL) was through the roof at my last physical. While my LDL was really low. My Doc asked what I was eating, and I told him about my Bulletproof experiment and he said it appears to be working at least for my HDL.</p>

<p>As for added benefits for workouts, I don't really notice a huge difference with coffee alone. When I add a NO2 booster to the bulletproof coffee, I do feel a big difference, but that may not be for everyone. </p>

<p>So, I said all that to say, it does work...to an extent. But I'd definitely advocate a DIY version rather than buying a bunch of overpriced products with highly questionable added benefits. </p>

<p>I hope this helps. I'd be happy to answer any other questions. </p>

"<p><strong>tl;dr:</strong> Permanent filters win on cost over time. Paper filters win on performance, clean-up, and health. Flavour is personal preference. Composting paper filters and spent grounds alleviates most of the environmental benefit of permanent filter.  <strong>My conclusion: paper filters, discarded into a compost pile, win hands down.</strong></p>

<p>Use of permanent versus one-time-use filters is a perennial question, with both concrete and personal-preference arguments. In addition to the link in the original post, there are a few other online articles with comparisons, such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>[1] pretty good <a href=""http://www.air-n-water.com/coffee-filters-information.htm"">pro/con overview from air-n-water</a> (obscure?);</li>
<li>[2] from <a href=""http://worldofcaffeine.com/2011/06/20/filter-drip-coffee-paper-vs-metal-filters/"">World of Caffeine</a>;</li>
<li>[3] from <a href=""http://www.livestrong.com/article/281062-health-effects-of-gold-coffee-filters/"">LiveStrong</a>, which advocates permanent filters (but has other statements with which I disagree);</li>
<li>[4] from <a href=""http://www.melitta.com/en/Why-We-Filter-1662.html"">Melitta</a>, but this may need a grain of salt, because they're in the business of making paper filters :)</li>
</ul>

<p>From those and my personal experience, I extracted an overview and conclusions, below. Unfortunately I've written <em>a lot of text</em> here, but there's a lot of facets. I've focused basically on <strong><em>paper versus metal mesh</em></strong>, as the most common types; I maintain the conclusions are similar regardless of material.</p>

<p><strong>Material.</strong> There are several materials used for permanent filters, including the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>metal mesh (stainless steel or ""gold tone"");</li>
<li>nylon (or other plastic) mesh;</li>
<li>perforated metal (thin metal sheet with holes);</li>
<li>fabric (e.g., flannel, muslin, hemp).</li>
</ul>

<p>All of these surely have different properties, but properties that I focus on here are common to most.</p>

<p>One-time-use filters are predominantly paper, but could also be bamboo, natural fibre, or other material. See also <a href=""http://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/1524/how-do-brown-and-white-paper-filters-compare"">this question for a comparison of brown versus white paper filters</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Performance.</strong> Paper filters are a finer filter; a permanent filter will permit some larger particles through to the cup. I find that a pot brewed with a permanent mesh filter will have a fine silt of coffee grounds at the bottom. For this same reason, some recommend to use a coarser grind for permanent filters.</p>

<p>Paper filters are also claimed to filter out some compounds (e.g., diterpenes such as <a href=""http://coffee.stackexchange.com/a/414/262"">cafestol, which may increase blood cholesterol levels</a>). Coffee brewed by other (non-paper-filter) methods have a higher concentration of cafestol in the resulting beverage.  See article [2] for more health claims of paper filters. On the other hand [3] says that paper filters filter out some <em>good</em> things, such as antioxidants, but I haven't seen that claim anywhere else.</p>

<p><strong>Flavour.</strong> Link number [4] claims better taste on paper filter than permanent filter (I happen to agree).  Permanent filters should also allow more oils to pass through, which will certainly have an impact on flavour; this is probably personal preference. The grit that passes through will also have a bittering effect over time, but probably not significant if you're drinking right away. Some (e.g., [1]) say nylon/plastic mesh will retain off-flavours over time.</p>

<p><strong>Cost.</strong> Varies greatly, but one can find permanent filters that are said to last for ""years"" for a few quid ($/€/£) up to 20-30 quid. Though dependent on usage and other factors, you'll have reasonable expectation of saving money over time by using a permanent filter.</p>

<p><strong>Clean-up.</strong> Clearly, the spent grounds from re-usable filters must be cleaned out; paper filters and their spent grounds can be pitched wholesale.  See another question about <a href=""http://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/1518/do-i-need-to-clean-my-drip-brew-coffee-makers-filter-every-time"">how often and how much to clean a permanent filter</a>. On the other hand, [3] claims that permanent filters are cleaner, but I don't agree.</p>

<p><strong>Waste / environmental issues.</strong> I couldn't find any data on how much energy is used to produce a paper filter versus a reusable filter, but many uses would certainly be necessary to break even! As far as waste volume though, you'll make up the difference with paper filters pretty quickly (but composting the paper instead alleviates this!). Cleaning permanent filters additionally requires water and detergent. Though, you may wish to <a href=""http://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/1551/should-i-rinse-paper-coffee-filters-before-use"">rinse your paper filters</a>, so water use is debatable. Ultimately, reusable filters will eventually wear out and need to be replaced.</p>

<p><strong>My Conclusion.</strong> For my money, personally, <strong>I prefer the paper filter:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Better flavour and texture (less bitter, less grit);</li>
<li>Convenience (easier to use and keep clean);</li>
<li>I compost the whole thing (paper filter, grounds and all), so the environmental impact is basically on the production end, which I'm okay with.</li>
<li>Marginal health concerns (cafestol/cholesterol; avoiding plastic whenever possible).</li>
</ul>

"<p>I've had all types of coffee, but certain brands or preparations seem to get me more 'speeded up' (like Starbucks coffee) than others. What causes certain coffee to be more ""stimulating"" than other coffee? Is is the caffeine content? How it's brewed? </p>

"<p>There are competing theories as to what you should do when tamping grounds in a portafilter. Some of these include:</p>

<li>Rotating the tamper while pressing down</li>

"<p>There are a number of concrete factors that will impact the stimulation you get from a cup of coffee, but it probably boils down to <strong>the amount of caffeine (and any other stimulants) that are in your cup</strong> that get extracted from the beans. Here's a few factors that affect the caffeine content of coffee, with links to other related questions on this site:</p>

<ul>
<li>Certain beans have more caffeine (themselves, per mass) than others, so there's more of it to get extracted into the cup;</li>
<li>Certain roasts (e.g., lighter) have more caffeine than others (see also <a href=""http://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/29/what-type-of-roast-has-the-lowest-caffeine-content"">lowest-caffeine roast</a>, or <a href=""http://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/79/how-can-i-figure-out-how-much-caffeine-is-in-my-cup"">calculating caffeine content</a>)</li>
<li>Certain preparation methods have more caffeine (e.g., <a href=""http://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/128/what-preparation-method-yields-the-most-caffeine"">caffeine content of preparation methods</a>)</li>
<li>There are factors in <a href=""http://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/1564/what-do-the-terms-extraction-and-strength-mean"">strength and extraction</a> -- e.g., more grounds and higher extraction will generally provide more caffeine.</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm lumping this all under ""caffeine"", but there are probably other stimulants in coffee besides caffeine (e.g., as suggested in <a href=""http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/106/23/2935.full"" rel=""nofollow"">this article</a> and others). </p>

<p>And then there's the intangible factors in ""stimulation"", such as marketing, cafe atmosphere, and so forth, which might have some other kind of effect (like ""conditioning"" or other ""mind games"") that might help you <em>feel like</em> the coffee is even more stimulating than it would be otherwise. These veer off-topic too much to discuss further.</p>

"<p>This link from <a href=""http://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/29410/is-there-a-method-to-pour-espresso-shots-without-damaging-the-crema"">Seasoned Advice</a> might help you. The accepted answer recommends to use an espresso brew pitcher and how to use it. The answer suggests two main things:</p>

<ul>
<li>a vessel with a pour spout helps with retaining the crema;</li>
<li>the speed of the pour is important.</li>
</ul>

<p>See more information at that link. It suggests that if you pour it in too fast, you ruin the foam. Too slow and the foam gets stuck. Practice sounds important here.</p>
"
"<p>There are a pantload of recommendations on tamping, but the one recommendation common to all is... <strong><em>practice!</em></strong> And... The most optimal way of <strong>tamping depends on every individual pull</strong>: the beans (freshness and grind), your skill, machine, etc. at that moment.</p>

<p>Ultimately, the goal (and most important part, in my belief) is to <strong>pack the grounds uniformly.</strong> Any non-uniformity in your puck will allow water to flow more through certain areas than others, giving you non-uniform extraction across your grounds (some over- and some under-extracted). For example, if your tamper isn't level, you'll end up with a ""slanted"" puck; if your grounds are packed <em>more loosely</em> in some places than others... these can yield un-even pucks.</p>

<p>That said, here's a few other common recommendations, some of which you mentioned in the question:</p>

<ul>
<li>Add the grounds uniformly and smooth before tamping. This gives you an even bed of grounds so you can tamp evenly.</li>
<li>15 kg / 30 lb. of pressure. A bath scale could help until one gets this ""by feel"".</li>
<li>Use a heavy tamper. This helps you control all of the other parameters.</li>
<li>Aim for sinking the tamp approximately as far as the bevel (a general rule).</li>
<li>Twisting is not necessary (some do at the end of the compression for ""polishing"", but not necessary).</li>
</ul>

<p>Then there's some controversial bits:</p>

<ul>
<li>""Knocking"" is something I totally don't understand. The idea is to tap the portafilter so as to somehow redistribute the grounds after tamping. I feel like it would just mess up a good puck, but some recommend it either to ensure uniformity of compression of the bottom and top of the puck, or to get grounds off of the side of the portafilter. More discussion at link [4].</li>
<li>On the ""North, South, West, East"" topic: this illustrates tamping at four points around the portafilter. Since the tamp is <em>slightly</em> smaller than the portafilter, the theory is that tamping at points around the sides helps to prevent grounds from creeping up around the tamp (up the side of the portafilter). It seems to me that an appropriate sized tamp will alleviate most of this, but it seems like a reasonable recommendation. Some guides (e.g., below) recommend this, others don't. More at [1].</li>

"<p>As I shop for a new espresso tamper, I see that there are a dizzying array of options for the <em>shape of the base</em> (i.e., the shape of the part that contacts the grounds). Some shapes include convex (""Euro"" more curved than ""American""), flat, rippled, or hybrids of those -- see some examples at <a href=""http://coffeetamper.com/store/pc/viewContent.asp?idpage=7"">Reg Barber</a>. (I'm also aware that there are many <em>shapes and sizes of the handle</em>, and differing <em>sizes</em> for the base; I'm not asking about those.)</p>

<p>In part spurred by <a href=""http://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/1583/what-is-essential-for-a-proper-tamp"">this recent question on the essentials of tamping</a>, and other questions tagged <a href=""/questions/tagged/tamping"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged 'tamping'"" rel=""tag"">tamping</a> (which are mostly about pressure), I got to thinking that the shape of the tamper could have a significant impact on the result.</p>

<p>There also seems to be a fairly large amount of <em>personal preference or opinion</em> in this realm. I can't find any proper comparisons or trials; at best I can find conversations about various preferences (e.g., <a href=""http://www.home-barista.com/tips/flat-or-curved-tamper-base-t7752.html"">home-barista</a> including <a href=""http://www.home-barista.com/espresso-machines/tamper-bottoms-flat-or-convex-t24.html"">this poll</a>, <a href=""http://coffeegeek.com/forums/espresso/questions/38331"">coffeegeek</a>, <a href=""http://www.coffeeforums.com/forum/coffee-espresso-machines/1234-tamper-flat-curved.html"">coffee forums</a>, <a href=""http://www.baristaexchange.com/forum/topics/tampers-flat-or-convex-which"">barista exchange</a>).

<li>curved bottom could over-compact the center;</li>
<li>ripple shape is pretty, is used by some pros including winner of a competition in 2009, but has no demonstrable benefit, and is marginally harder to clean.</li>

"<p>The roasting chamber of your Gene Cafe is <strong>made of Pyrex</strong> (heat-resistant tempered glass), and leaving the old oils to accumulate and burn will cause the the inside of the drum to turn black. The darker material will likely change your roasting time, and the fouled glass will not allow you to monitor your roasts. <strong>Glass does not need ""seasoning""</strong>, so it should be cleaned regularly per the manufacturer's recommendations.  </p>

<p><em>Seasoning</em> is typically a way to create a stick-resistant coating on a <em>porous</em> metal surface (like cast iron or carbon steel). When a thin layer of fat or oil is heated on these surfaces, it forms a polymer which provides rust protection and creates a non-stick surface that will keep whatever you are cooking/roasting from reacting with the cooking surface (the <em>juju</em> you mentioned above). </p>

<p>If the roasting chamber were made of cast iron or carbon steel, seasoning would be recommended. But neither glass nor stainless steel need seasoning, and you're just changing the built-in characteristics of your roaster. </p>

"<p>Different people react to chemicals and stimulants in slightly different manners.  It's entirely possible that the raise in blood pressure caused by caffeine may be exaggerated in some individuals (especially those who are caffeine naive) and cause headaches.  </p>

<p>I conducted an experiment and created an Americano and a Long Black simultaneously using a La Marzocco. Immediately after brewing the result was as expected with the Long Black having more crema.  However, by the time they had sat a bit and cooled enough to drink (approximately 2 minutes), the crema had broken down and they looked almost identical.</p>

<p>Does the crema breaking up during brewing (Americano) or shortly thereafter (Long Black) really make a difference/affect the taste?  If not, is the difference merely academic or is there some other reason why the order of operations matters?</p>

<p>Rancidification (""going rancid"") is a process by which fats (oils) break down into... other chemicals you don't want (and smell bad). The smell could be described as rank or rotten.</p>

<p>Oxidation is another class of chemical reaction that could also produce off-smells and tastes. This could be caused by contact with air (specifically, for example, oxygen) or other factors. </p>

<p>More broadly, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autolysis_(biology)"" rel=""nofollow""><strong>autolysis</strong></a> describes other factors of, for example, plant material breaking down by itself over time (e.g., self-degredation by a cell's own enzymes).

"<p>It is evident that decaffeinated coffee <a href=""http://coffee.stackexchange.com/q/204/179""><strong>still contains a very low amount of caffeine</strong></a>.</p>

<p>What I'm interested in is that if decaf coffee still contains some very low amounts of caffeine, and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caffeine_dependence""><em>caffeine is addictive</em></a>, therefore: <strong>is decaf coffee addictive?</strong></p>

<p><hr />
<sup>★ I'm not talking about the 'habitual' dependence. I.e. the <strong>routine</strong> of drinking the same cup of decaf coffee everyday, but rather the 'physical' or chemical dependence.</sup></p>
"
"<p>Since decaf coffee isn't the same as caffeine-free coffee, the key point regarding addiction is the amount of daily servings of decaf coffee that deliver the 100 milligrams of caffeine needed to acquire some sort of dependence <sup><a href=""http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2005/01/0119_050119_ngm_caffeine.html"" rel=""nofollow"">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>The amount of such cups of decaf will vary according to the brand chosen. According to a study published in the <em>Journal of Analytical Toxicology</em>, and cited in the article <a href=""http://www.webmd.com/diet/20061011/decaf-coffee-isnt-caffeine-free"" rel=""nofollow"">Decaf coffee isn't caffeine free</a>, they say that in average, a cup of decaf can hold about one-twentieth of the caffeine you get in a normal drip brewed coffee.</p>

<p>In that same article, they state that drinking more cups of decaf can compensate the lack of caffeine, and still be able to produce addiction.</p>

<p>So, it is indeed a matter of how many cups of decaf you drink.</p>

"<p>At work I usually drink coffee (multiple times daily) from a metallic cup which I actually never ever wash on the inside. This leads to the building of interesting dust-like coffee residuals. While this started out of mere laziness, I meanwhile deliberately refrain from washing it as the result is visually quite appealing and an interesting long-term endeavour to see how that coffee cup evolves over the years.</p>

<p>I am however wondering <strong>if those residuals actually have any kind of influence on the fresh coffee drank from this cup</strong>. Now of course there isn't anything moulding, it's an entirely dry thin dust layer, and I don't really make out any taste difference to a clean cup (as the coffee isn't too much of a high quality product in the first place and I'm not a big tasting expert either). So this might be a stupid question. But for example I heard somewhere (though, that's entirely anecdotal hearsay, too) that you shouldn't wash a tea can with dishwasher but only with water because of some flavoury reasons. So maybe there is actual proper or even scientifically grounded reasoning that the <strong>dry residuals of previous coffee in the cup have any kind of influence on the coffee drinking experience, however small and imperceptible, be that flavour-wise or regarding other effects, advantageous or defective</strong>.</p>
"
"<p>You're actually asking two different questions. </p>

<p>The minute amount of coffee left to evaporate in the bottom of a cup will have completely oxidized and lost virtually all of its volatile compounds (i.e. It probably wouldn't taste very good if you reconstituted it on its own). So when you add more <em>fresh</em> coffee to that cup, yes, you are essentially adding a minute amount of an external (and somewhat <em>off</em>) flavor component to your brew.</p>

<p>Now whether that flavor component contributes to any any <strong><em>perceptible</em></strong> change in flavor is highly debatable. Line up 100 coffee drinkers in a blind tasting, and I suspect there would be no statistically significant detection between <em>""100% fresh""</em> and <em>""Christian's 0.083% dust-like coffee residuals.""</em></p>

<p>Your analogy to washing tea cans in a dishwasher is a bit off. Washing containers in a dishwasher is generally known to leave a perceptible taste of <em>soap</em> on the container. Soap is completely foreign to the coffee-tasking experience so it is easily <em>tasted</em> if it is present. But the residuals you are leaving behind in your unwashed-coffee-cup study are still <em>essentially</em> coffee (somewhat <em>off</em> coffee, but coffee nonetheless). So mixing the equivalent of ""a few drops"" of <em>off</em> coffee in a hot cup of fresh I suspect will have no <em>perceptible</em> effect on taste. </p>

<p>I also suspect that your coffee cup experiment is <em>not</em> evolving over the years. The metallic cup is likely stainless steel or perhaps aluminum (and most coffee cups are made of ceramic). In either case, the cup is largely <em>stainless</em>, so you are not likely building up any patina&hellip; so you are essentially ""washing away"" the previous day's experiment each time you add a fresh cup of hot coffee. There should be no substantial, cumulative effect.</p>

"<p>How much funding is provided by the coffee industry for research on the health benefits of coffee?</p>

<p>I came across a statistic that surprised me by its meagerness.  According to <a href=""http://www.ncausa.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=880"">their website</a>, the National Coffee Association USA has spent $6 million on research funding over the last 20 or so years.  The NCAUSA cites 80 specific investigations that they funded. (I don't know if the trend is up or down over the two decades.)</p>

<p>From reading Antony Wild's <a href=""http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/coffee-antony-wild/1112483551?ean=9780393060713"">Coffee: A Dark History</a> a few years ago, it was my impression that the coffee industry sets great importance on <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2015/03/04/health/coffee-myth-fact/"">demonstrable health benefits</a>. See in particular Chapt. 14, Coffee, Science and History.</p>

<p>The book mentions specifically the <a href=""http://vanderbilt.edu/ics/"">Vanderbilt Institute for Coffee Studies</a> as funded by ""a $6 million grant from the coffee industry"" to Vanderbilt University Medical Center in 1999.  (In 2007 the Institute moved its affiliation from the Medical Center to the Vanderbilt Center for Latin American Studies, but continues investigating ""the health effects of coffee consumption, including potential therapeutic uses"".)  While some of this funding came from NCAUSA, it appears the bulk came from the Association of Coffee Producing Countries (ACPC), with additional funding by the All Japan Coffee Association and the International Coffee Organization.</p>

<p>The global coffee commodity market has annual sales <a href=""http://www.trademap.org/Country_SelProduct_TS.aspx?nvpm=|||||0901|||4|1|1|2|2|1|2|1|"">well-up in the tens of billions($)</a>, so I would expect more in annual research funding than the average $300K/yr reported by NCAUSA.</p>

<p><strong>Added:</strong> Apparently it is difficult for coffee trade associations to survive.  The NCAUSA cited above is ancient in comparison to other organizations mentioned.  The Association of Coffee Producing Countries (ACPC) <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/03/business/world-markets-a-new-coffee-cartel-tries-its-hand.html"">began in 1993</a> with a model of OPEC-like price supports through agreed upon limitations of exports, but <a href=""http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/1608356.stm"">dissolved at the beginning of 2002</a>.  So a dimension of this topic is the limited degree to which coffee producers and manufacturers are able to cooperate.</p>

"<p>I don't know any history behind the practice but I learned it myself during a rafting trip down the Grand Canyon back in the early '90's.  The method was to put a couple of fistfuls of loose grounds in one of those giant porcelain coffee pots that look like they came out of a Zane Grey novel.  Follow with two whole uncooked eggs and with a big metal spoon, stir the whole mess in the bottom of the pot, breaking the eggs and mixing it well with the dry grounds.  Fill the pot with cold water and put on a hot fire until the thing boils.  Take the pot off the fire and open the lid, dribbling about a cup of cold water over the top of the liquid inside.  Somehow this settles all the solids to the bottom of the pot and the coffee really tasted pretty good.  My take was that the egg sort of smoothed out any harshness the crude method would have introduced to the coffee otherwise.  The grounds pretty much stay at the bottom of the pot and were not really a problem in the cup.  </p>

<p>I couldn't believe it would work as well as it did but I'm a believer.  Where it originated, I have no idea, but I have to believe it was away from civilization because the method was so crude.</p>

"<p>I would add to <strong>not</strong> store it in the refrigerator or freezer.  It would fare better at room temperature and dry than cold where it could be exposed to food smells and moisture.  You didn't ask, but also drink it as soon as possible if it's ground.  Whole beans will keep for awhile but ground coffee will start to go stale after a week or two, even if stored properly.</p>

<p>The <a href=""http://ncausa.org"" rel=""nofollow""><em>National Coffee Association</em></a> advises this:  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is important not to refrigerate or freeze your daily supply of coffee because contact with moisture will cause it to deteriorate.  Instead, store coffee in air-tight glass or ceramic containers and keep it in a convenient, but dark and cool, location. Remember that a cabinet near the oven is often too warm, as is a cabinet on an outside wall of your kitchen if it receives heat from a strong afternoon or summer sun.</p>
  
  <p>The commercial coffee containers that you purchased your coffee in are generally not appropriate for long-term storage. Appropriate coffee storage canisters with an airtight seal are a worthwhile investment.</p>
</blockquote>
"
"<p><strong>Room temperature, open-air is fine (for a while)</strong></p>

<p>""Microroasted"" implies that you purchased the beans where the roasting was done on premises. That means it was probably roasted recently, within a couple of days. Roasts vary, but generally a bean will remain fresh for a week or two, open-air, room temperature from the time of roasting. One person might take two weeks to use a pound of beans. Just keep it in the closed bag, away from temperature extremes.</p>

<p>No coffee will taste fresh after months, no matter the storage. There are gas-valve tins and bags available online. Coffee beans are quiet dynamic. The chemistry continues long after the roasting heat is removed. The logic behind one-way valves is that fresh-roasted beans continue to release gases that were trapped in the beans. I roast coffee beans and store them in a dark cabinet in a wire basket, exposed to the kitchen air. No bean survives more than 10 days. Most often, the flavor actually improves after a few days.</p>

That is, <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17214716"">this study from 2007</a> (<a href=""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-4632.2007.03119.x/abstract"">another link from publisher</a>, <a href=""http://www.caffeineinformer.com/caffeine-a-cure-for-baldness"">a colloquial summary of the study</a>) took biopsy samples of follicles from men with <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Androgenic_alopecia"">AGA</a> (""male pattern baldness"") and treated them caffeine (and hormones), <strong>finding that caffeine was ""a promising candidate for hair growth stimulation"" and ""may have important clinical impact"".</strong> Another note is that this is <em>ex vivo</em> -- which I take to mean topical in this sense -- drinking a bunch of coffee is unlikely to help (the summary article suggests that the dose necessary of orally-consumed coffee to get the same effect is ~6 <em>grams</em> -- many dozens of cups of coffee, and perhaps fatal dose). If you don't happen to subscribe to the <a href=""http://www.intsocderm.org"">International Journal of Dermatology</a> you can obtain the <a href=""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-4632.2007.03119.x/epdf"">PDF of this article</a> for perhaps a small fee.</p>

<p><strong>I don't know if this has been demonstrated in any clinical trials.</strong> I can't find any longitudinal studies of longer-term effectiveness, nor can I find any evidence of actual clinical trials. There are a few more links in the caffeine-related clauses at the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management_of_hair_loss#Experimental_medication"">management of hair loss Wikipedia article</a>.</p>

<p>Also, as an aside, you <em>might</em> get a little ""caffeine buzz"" from it! There are some <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shower_Shock"">bar soaps, like this one</a>, that make the (largely unverified) claim that some of the caffeine is absorbed through your skin. Win-win?</p>

<p>""To keep this on-topic..."" As for using instant coffee or some other source of caffeine (e.g., pills) to be applied topically to your scalp, I can't find anything about that either. Concentrations cited in the study are ""0.001% and 0.005%."" <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_bean"">Coffee beans themselves</a> have about 1-4% caffeine before roasting, so it's reasonable to expect that you could get to the concentration used in the study with a paste of instant coffee, but I don't know about the ""bioavailability"" of caffeine from topical application of instant coffee. Robusta beans are generally on the higher end of caffeine content and might be cheaper. Also, green beans will have a higher caffeine content than roasted, but I might be taking this a bit too far...</p>

"<p><strong>Sugar adds a sweet taste to coffee,</strong> not a sour taste.  <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taste#Sourness"">Sourness</a> and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweetness"">sweetness</a> are rather separate <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taste"">tastes</a>! Different flavours will to some extent interact with each other, and individual preference and taste have something to do with this, but there are particular causes of certain flavours.</p>

<p><em>Sourness</em> is a perception of <em>acidity</em>. In high enough quantities, sugar can overwhelm the perception of acidity (e.g., <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cola"">cola</a> has a pH ~2.5, but doesn't taste sour because the perception is overwhelmed by sugar/sweetness; see also <a href=""http://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/17395/why-does-adding-sugar-to-sour-things-cause-them-not-to-be-sour"">this Seasoned Advice question on sugar reducing perception of sourness</a>). I don't see how sugar could be <em>the cause</em> of sourness (i.e., sugar is not acidic). <strong>EDIT:</strong> That said, it <em>might</em> be the case that this is a temporal situation. Sugar <em>reduces</em> the perception of sourness, but it <em>could</em> be the case this change is temporary: For example, if the sweetness (sugar) <em>dissipates more quickly</em> than the sourness (acids), you might be left with ""more sourness than sweetness"" in the <em>aftertaste</em> after some time. That is, you're left with ""un-maksked"" residual sourness which, though present all along, is more <em>perceptible</em> after the sugar has dissipated. However, all of this is entirely speculation; I have no justification for this, and haven't found any supporting information.</p>

<p><em>Sweetness</em> is perceived by the presence of <em>sugar</em> (and/or other chemicals that happen to interact in similar ways with sweetness <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemoreceptor"">perception</a>). Sugar will also impact mouthfeel.</p>

<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taste#Bitterness"">Bitterness</a> is separate also; see <a href=""http://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/495/does-adding-salt-to-coffee-reduce-bitterness"">this question on salt and bitterness in coffee</a>.</p>

<p>I don't think there are any chemical changes to the sugar happening in this case.</p>

"<p>I've been brewing my coffee with an AeroPress for a couple of years now and I've become aware of the huge number of variables available to me in making my morning Java.  Assuming the same bean and roast level, I see </p>

<ol>
<li>amount of ground coffee, </li>
<li>grind coarsness,</li>
<li>temperature of the water,</li>
<li>steep time, and </li>
<li>using the AeroPress right side up or upside down, </li>
</ol>

<p>as the variables I can play with to vary the taste.  Some of these variables may offset each other as well.  For example would steeping coarser ground coffee result in the same taste as less time steeping a finer grind?  Or how about coarser ground coffee in hotter water v. finer ground at lower temperature?  </p>

<p>I'm searching for the key variables in my control to play with to maximize the effect on taste.</p>
"
"<p>A few other factors to consider:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Freshly ground beans.</p></li>
<li><p>How you store your coffee beans. You basically want to keep them reasonably cool and away from oxygen, sunlight, moisture and variations in temperature (which is why you don't keep them in the freezer except for long term storage). Generally in the pantry in an opaque, air-tight container. I one-way valve is recommended as recently roasted beans will emit CO<sub>2</sub>. I bought a stack of <a href=""http://fivesenses.com.au/shop/associated/250g-empty-bags"">250g resealable foil bags with the one-way valve</a> from a local roaster and would use each bag a few times. These days I use <a href=""http://planetarydesign.com/products/airscape-kitchen-canisters/"">AirScape canisters</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><a href=""http://web.archive.org/web/20131017143359/http://dailyshotofcoffee.com/great-coffee-starts-with-the-right-water/"">The water you use.</a> If you wouldn't enjoy drinking your tap water, don't use it to brew coffee. Use the same water you use for drinking water.</p></li>
<li><p>The amount of water you put in the Aeropress vs. the amount of water and/or milk you add afterwards (if any).</p></li>
<li><p>How vigorously you stir with the paddle. Generally you want to stir just enough to ensure all the grounds are thoroughly wetted, and that there are no air pockets. Stirring too much can over-extract which will increase the bitterness.</p></li>
<li><p>When pressing into the cup, do you only press until you hear the air hissing through, or do you keep going and compress the puck, squeezing out every bit of water you can?[1] The latter can over-extract and increase bitterness.</p></li>
<li><p>Using paper filters vs. a metal disc filter. Also, some people believe pre-rinsing a paper filter makes a difference.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Obviously there are a lot of variables, and people can become amazingly pedantic. Fun if you don't mind a bit of experimentation.</p>

<p>With regards to water temperature, the general wisdom is that you want the slurry of coffee and water to brew at around 95&deg;C, which is just a bit under boiling for optimal extraction. <a href=""http://www.tested.com/food/coffee/455840-how-important-coffee-brew-water-temperature/"">This video</a> gives some pretty good advice on this. Pre-heating the Aeropress would probably make the biggest difference here[2]. I usually just wait until the water in the kettle stops bubbling before pouring. Apparently it is possible to burn the grounds if you hit them with water that is boiling.</p>

<p>The other bugbear I have is with retention in coffee grinders. Retention is when grounds are left up in the works of the grinder, and often the grounds can come out very staticy and cling to everything and make a mess. This grosses me out as it means old grounds from previous grinding will be dropped in with the fresh grind. Weighing the beans before and after can show a variation of half a gram or more. Urk.[3] However I've found that sprinkling a couple of drops of water on the beans before grinding almost completely eliminates retention for me.[4]</p>

<p>[1] There's a term for over-squeezing the grounds that escapes me at the moment.</p>

<p>[2] Having lived a lot of my life in drought areas, using and then discarding the water to pre-heat my Aeropress or French press is something I find surprisingly hard to do.</p>

"<p>Assuming the same beans and roast level, I think the variables that affect the taste most are the freshness at all stages. All other variables make the difference between great and merely good, but they may not affect taste in ways as noticeable as freshness.</p>

<p>Freshness at all stages means the roast freshness and the ground freshness, as well as the fruit itself.</p>

<p>A tricky aspect of this answer is that ""fresh"" does not necessarily mean the ""shortest life"". For example, I like working with green beans that came just a few months ago at most, after they get stable in their new climate. After roasting, the best taste comes up 2-3 days later in our case. And brewing comes right after grinding---always. This example is for illustration purpose; numbers may not serve elsewhere. The point is really freshness along the bean lifetime, and the fuzziness of freshness.</p>

"<p>At the office, we have a coffee maker with a <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B0001IRRL6"">stainless steel vacuum carafe similar to this one</a>. It has accumulated coffee residue in it from 5+ years of hard service, whilst receiving in return what I shall politely call ""inadequate cleansing."" </p>

<p>It's a double-wall vacuum container. There is no heating element, so I'm not exactly sure what causes this buildup in the first place. The <a href=""https://www.cuisinart.com/share/pdf/manuals/dtc-975bkn.pdf"">manufacturer user manual</a> suggests to clean using dish soap / mild detergent, or the top rack of a dishwasher; I've tried both, neither worked. I have also tried scrubbing with non-abrasive brush, sponge, and dish detergents; improved, still lots of residue. I soaked in two batches of near-boiling water and bicarb (baking soda) for about an hour. The first rinse looked almost like brewed coffee; this was <em>shocking</em>. After all that, the situation was improved but there's still lots of residue.</p>

<p>There are myriad suggestions for removing coffee <em>stains</em> from stainless steel, like <a href=""http://www.wikihow.com/Remove-Coffee-Stains-from-a-Stainless-Steel-Pot"">this set of eight (8) from Wikihow</a>. It suggests exposing the inside to various household chemicals: vinegar, baking soda / bicarb, bleach (!?), salt, ice cubes, etc. This <a href=""http://www.simplyorganized.me/2012/08/how-to-clean-stainless-coffee-pot.html"">other article suggests using a <em>dishwasher</em> detergent tablet</a> but it uses anonymous tablets. It does give a nod to using dishwasher detergent powder (as I did <a href=""http://cooking.stackexchange.com/a/51953/25286"">with this other device</a>), but I'd prefer to know what is the actual cleansing chemical at work.</p>

<p>So before I either abandon this (decidedly serviceable) carafe for a new one, or begin indexing my pantry for candidate chemicals: <strong>How should I clean this stainless carafe?</strong> Surely someone must have had and solved this problem.</p>

<p>In addition: I'd also like to ensure that I don't make this worse in the process; e.g., scratching or etching the inside of the carafe. Are these carafes predisposed to buildup? What's causing it? Besides regular cleaning, is there anything else that will keep this thing cleaner for a longer period of time?</p>

"<p>In Australia we have different differences between a latte and a cappucino. They're both the same size and made the same way (some say a cappuccino should be a little bit frothier), but they're both served in different styles of cups (this is important but I don't really know why) and the cappuccino has chocolate sprinkles on top.</p>

<p>Here's a latte glass:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/tcX7Gm.jpg"" alt=""latte""></p>

<p>And here's a cappuccino cup:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/Stqnpm.jpg"" alt=""cappuccino""></p>
"
"<p>I am answering here as it applies to Italy, elsewhere it can be different.</p>

<p>Cappuccino in Italian means little cappuccio, which in turn means little cap.
It is a milk-and-coffee drink with a peculiar topping:  a milk foam obtained with steam. You might ask to add also some chocolate powder. Apart from the taste, the powder filling the foam pore gives a pleasant look to the drink. When travelling abroad, I see this as a standard feature, but here it is on request.</p>

<p>The steam is produced from a pump part of quite a large coffee machine, which is the  standard equipment of any  Italian bar. Because of the high pressure involved it is normally not possible to produce a cappuccino at home, at least not using a standard stove. Anyway nowadays they are selling cut down versions of the bar machine, which can produce bar-like cappuccinos (and coffee) even at home. </p>

<p>Temperature is crucial for cappuccino. Hot temperature is necessary to produce the foam, but a too hot cappuccino will hurt your tongue. Contrary to a hot cup of tea, where you can wait for it to become  colder, here when the hot goes away also the foam does, so what you drink is not a cappuccino anymore.</p>

<p>Espresso means express, as you might guess. It is a coffee made with the big machine I mentioned above.
Contrary to the coffee made at home on the stove, with the so called moka machine, this machine can make a good coffee instantly. That anyway requires this appliance to be already setup (with proper pressure and temperature levels), which takes time but it is done only once, in the morning, when the bar opens. it might help observing that breakfast is almost inexistent in Italy, as it consists for many of a fast and frugal espresso  or cappuccino with a croissant, taken  standing still at the bar before commuting  to you workplace. So speed in brewing pays.</p>

<p>Besides Italian approach to coffee as a drink is radically different. For what I have seen, in the rest of the world the coffee is drunk in mugs similar to those used for the tea (I am thinking to American coffee for example); here  the size of a coffee cup is extremely small and  this is because the drink is concentrated. To brew the coffee like  this you need water at  high pressure and  high temperature forced  through a  tier of coffee by the coffee machine. </p>

<p>Big espresso machines found in bars are ideal, given their power, to obtain this and generally their output is considered better than moka coffee made at home.</p>

<p>Note that contrary to cappuccino, here the higher the temperature the better the taste. To make it drinkable bars use special cups very thick. The final results is that you don't hurt your lips when you drink, also the volume of liquid  going through your mouth is less, and you don't burn your tongue.</p>

<p>I have read that the total caffeine in an American coffee is higher, anyway the sensation that you have with an espresso is like you are taking something stronger and we even amplify this effect by drinking it fast, often in one shot.</p>

<p>Given the high temperature and pressure, if one does not make the espresso daily, it is very easy to make it  <em>burned</em>, producing something that is  bitter and distasteful. I have seen many  used  to American coffee (big cups), disliking espresso and vice versa. 
Anyway, before deciding that the strong taste of espresso is not for you, make sure you have tasted a professionally  made one.</p>

<p>As I said before, there are now home espresso machines, which are also easy to operate. </p>

<p>Latte is short for latte macchiato, stained milk. The stain is the a little quantity of coffee.</p>

<p>Strange as it may seem, in Italy the word espresso is a sort of foreigner word not used at all. Perhaps it was in 1800, when the espresso was invented, but now we just say: ""A coffee, please"".   </p>

"<p>Tannin is a chemical contained in coffee and this is what normally stains your coffee making / drinking equipment. </p>

<p>When using an espresso machine it is advised to 'backflush' your machine with cleaning powder which cleans away a build up of 'tannin' from inside the machine. I expect a similar thing has happened to your carafe. With an espresso machine you're advised to do it weekly with heavy use - so I can imagine an ""inadequate cleansed"" carafe would probably be heavily tannin stained.</p>

<p>You can purchase tannin cleaning powder from any coffee supplier, such as <a href=""https://www.happydonkey.co.uk/machine-cleaning/"" rel=""nofollow"">Happy Donkey</a>. </p>

<p>Even though it is designed for Espresso Machines - it is perfectly safe to dissolve the powder in water and use it to clean other tannin stained equipment.</p>
"
"<p>Imposing as the build-up of dark staining on the wall of your stainless steel carafe may seem, I predict it will come up with water and a bit of effort with a paper towel or other light cleaning tool.  I recommend using cold or lukewarm water as this will allow you rub at the (layers of) stain without risk of pain from hot water.</p>

<p>The build-up is largely from water soluble compounds in the coffee, and because the brewing process creates a concentration of these in hot water, as the brew cools these tend to come out of solution.  There will also be tiny particles of ground coffee, small enough to make their way through the filter/basket that holds the original coffee grounds, and these particles act to promote the staining/sedimentation, esp. at the bottom of your carafe.</p>

<p>You've already seen the first evidence of success when the rinse water came out almost as dark as the brewed coffee the carafe normally holds.  It's large a matter of repetition.  However if the carafe were used to hold some coffee mixed with something else, such as milk or creamer, this can make a more difficult cleaning problem (because the fat in milk will act as a binding agent that resists water solution).  I assume that is not the case here since most people in the office will have their own preferences for adding milk or other creamers, if any.</p>

<p>It's a bit easier to see how quickly the staining rinses out of a glass carafe (several rinses may be needed, judging by your description of the build-up), but there's nothing about a steel carafe that would make the staining more difficult to remove.</p>

"<p>The other day, I had stupid idea:</p>

<p>What if I made my coffee in big batch and freeze what I did not manage to drink?</p>

<p>Let's put away why would I even want to do it. And for sake of argument, I know it is probably bad idea, but still:</p>

<p><strong>Why is it bad idea?</strong></p>
"
"<p>This is a perfectly good idea, if you freeze the coffee as cubes and plan to use them to chill your iced coffee without watering it down.</p>

<p>If you plan to simply freeze the coffee for drinking later I can imagine it being a bad idea, because you <strong>will lose some of the flavor</strong>. If you even poured milk or cream into the coffee you're planning to freeze, I would even recommend less freezing it, because no kind of milk products can be safely frozen and those are always better used fresh.</p>

"<p>To reduce the bitterness it is important to know the brewing method. Each brewing method needs its own grinding of the beans. Espresso machines use a finer grinding than slow (filter) coffee for example.</p>

<p>Lets assume an espresso machine is being used by the OP. A finer grinding can result in 'channeling'. Channeling means the water creates a single channel trough the coffee puck instead of evenly distributed water flow. The single channel will lose its good taste because of the quantity of water it processes. So the result product aquires all of its taste of that single channel. In a matter of seconds you will be left with bitter coffee. The other effect of finer grinding is a longer exposure to the water, because the water takes longer to reach the bottom of the puck because of the fine grind.</p>

<p>Other factors resulting in bitter taste: water quality, bean type, bean freshness and roasting process, tamping (for espresso machines), cleaning of your brewing device, cleaning of your grinder, extraction time, water temperature, and so on. So a lot is involved and a single answer to this broad question cannot be given. Entire books have been written on this topic.</p>

"<p>In addition to abby's answer. The freshness of the coffee beans can have a large effect on the amount of crema produced. I've found that beans that are more than 3-4 weeks from the roasting date start to produce less and less crema.</p>

<p>Be sure to find the correct dose of soap and be aware that soap residue can stick to the steamwand, so remember to clean it by purging the same way as you would froth milk. </p>

<p>I find this method much more suitable than wasting a lot milk if you intend to do it a couple of times a day for practicing.</p>
"
"<p>My cafetiere has the instruction that you should not use boiling water (I think the recommended temp is 85 degrees centigrade) so as to not scald the coffee and then let it steep for 5 minutes before plunging.</p>

<p>Personally I swirl it around a bit about a minute before the 5 minutes has elapsed just to agitate it a bit.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.grumpymule.co.uk/coffee-tour/making-perfect-coffee/cafetiere-coffee"" rel=""nofollow"">Grumpy Mule</a> recommends waiting 30 secs first before pouring the water on and waiting 4 minutes they also recommend wetting the grounds first, waiting for the bloom to settle before filling with water.</p>
"
"<p>Start with a course ground of coffee with about 1 ounce (28 grams) of coffee for about every 15 ounces (450 ml) of water. The water temperature should be below boiling, about 200-205° F (93-96° C).</p>

<p>Stir in about 1/3 of your water to let the coffee grounds ""bloom"" for about 30 seconds; then add the remaining water, cover it, and let it steep. <strong>The total brew time should be about four minutes.</strong> Then press the plunger to the bottom and pour. </p>

<p>Once the plunger is pressed, be sure to dispense the coffee into another container once that brewing cycle is done. If you let the brewed coffee sit with the spent grounds, it will start to develop a more-bitter taste and be somewhat over-extracted (unless that is an effect you are looking for). </p>

<p>Note: There is also a ""cold-brewing"" method which requires several hour of extraction, but that is likely outside the scope of what you are asking. </p>

"<p>Typically, a ristretto is an espresso shot pulled with half as much water. If you assume a normal shot is 30ml, the only practical difference in pulling a ristretto is to stop the extraction at 15ml. </p>

<p>The coffee grind, quantity and pull pressure should remain the same.</p>

<p>Regardless, if you feel as if the shot is taking too long, or coming out too fast, you could try adjusting the grind before adjusting the pressure, which should be trickier.</p>
"
"<p>I was wondering what process, or processes, would yield the highest caffeine quantity at a fixed drink size (Say 200ml).</p>

<p>Assuming the same variety of bean, same roast, same quantity, same water temperature and same extraction time. </p>
"
"<p>I think the answer to your question is generally going to be espresso.</p>

<p>Brewing process all comes down to pressure, temperature, extraction time (water contact time), possibly agitation and filtering. I may be missing a variable, but all the methods of brewing are just mixing of those variables. If you fix all but one variable, you'd have an answer for any given equation.</p>

<p>All of these things are ultimately affecting the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solubility"" rel=""nofollow"">solubility</a> of the caffeine in the coffee.  Since espresso is one of the few brewing methods to affect pressure (and generally uses the greatest pressure) it's going to be the winner.  <a href=""http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S0100-40422008000600009&amp;script=sci_arttext"" rel=""nofollow"">Increased pressure means increased caffeine solubility.</a></p>

<p>From wikipedia you'll note the two major factors affecting solubility are temperature and pressure.  You'll also note that dissolution doesn't always happen instantly; rates may vary based on conditions.  By increasing pressure during brewing my guess is that the rate of caffeine dissolution is increased.  making it more efficient for short brewing times.</p>
"
"<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> I thought about this more. In sum, I believe that this question (as asked) is not answerable (but it <em>is</em> interesting!). With just about <em>any</em> selected brewing method, you'll be able to extract almost all of the caffeine from the beans. However, depending on the method chosen, you need to use different parameters to get full extraction (time, pressure, temperature, etc.). For example: Espresso is certainly the fastest to get full caffeine extraction, but you need a fine grind.  Filter/drip or French press are slower, but espresso-fine grind just won't work correctly; you need to use a coarser grind. Given the same beans, and the right technique for the given method, you can achieve almost 100% caffeine extraction.  </p>

<p>As an example of drip versus espresso, the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caffeine"" rel=""nofollow"">Wikipedia article on caffeine</a> (and the two cited references that include figures on both espresso and drip caffeine content -- <a href=""https://www.erowid.org/chemicals/caffeine/caffeine_info1.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">this</a> and <a href=""http://www.caffeineinformer.com/the-caffeine-database"" rel=""nofollow"">this</a>) claim nearly the same caffeine content for drip versus espresso; in fact, they list that drip coffee has <em>slightly more</em> caffeine than espresso. I can't fully accept these, however, because there's no way to know if they're using arabica or robusta, light roast or dark roast, how much ground coffee was used to brew -- there's just too many unknowns that back those figures. Since arabica, for instance, is ~1% caffeine, with 7g of coffee (""standard dose"", from INEI) you'll be able to get ~70mg caffeine. Those are pretty consistent with the cited figures -- meaning 100% caffeine extraction.</p>

<p>So, you'd have to ask a different question in a different way (e.g., what's the fastest extraction method? or How to get 100% caffeine extraction with cold brew?) or so.</p>

<hr>

<p>I agree with most of @Chris in AK's answer (and +1!), but I wanted to add another take on this.</p>

<p>I don't think solubility is a big factor here; caffeine is <em>very</em> soluble in hot water -- approaching 66g/100mL (~150g/cup) in boiling water, and even at room temperature nearly 2g/100mL (~5g/cup) (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caffeine#Chemical_properties"" rel=""nofollow"">citation listed at Wikipedia</a> and <a href=""http://www.chemicalbook.com/ChemicalProductProperty_EN_CB0202769.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>). Yes, those are listed as <em>grams</em>, which means that water could dissolve <em>tens to hundreds of times</em> as much caffeine, as compared to the caffeine dose in an average cup/demitasse of strong coffee or espresso (which contain perhaps ~50mg-200mg per cup; see also questions on caffeine content, such as <a href=""http://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/79/how-can-i-figure-out-how-much-caffeine-is-in-my-cup"">this</a> and <a href=""http://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/94/how-much-caffeine-is-in-an-espresso-shot"">this</a>; also keep in mind that the <a href=""http://coffee.stackexchange.com/a/469/262"">lethal dose of caffeine</a> is somewhere in the 10g-20g range.)</p>

<p>Back to your actual question, I do agree that you've restricted yourself quite a bit; pressure is one of the few variables you didn't eliminate. To that end: a comparison of extraction of pressure-brewed (e.g., espresso) versus filter/drip follows.</p>

<p>In general, caffeine is quickly extracted from coffee beans (and tea leaves); most is extracted within 30 seconds of water contact (though this certainly depends on fineness of grind and other factors). Here's a visualization of <a href=""http://www.espressoplanet.com/espresso-coffee-machine/pressure_brewed_coffee_extraction.html"" rel=""nofollow"">extraction of comparison of pressure-brewed and drip versus time</a>, which depicts the quantity of caffeine (and other stuff) extracted over time. I found it amusing that the context of that article is actually advocating for espresso as a way to brew <em>lower</em> caffeine content coffee; the point being that the ""other stuff"" (aroma, colour, flavour) is extracted even more quickly with pressure-brewed (versus drip) coffee.  So, if you extract for only 10 seconds (which is <em>very</em> short indeed) you'll get most of the ""other stuff"" but less caffeine. On the other hand, a finer grind will permit faster extraction of caffeine and everything else; <a href=""http://www.kickinghorsecoffee.com/en/blog/caffeine-myths-espresso-vs-drip"" rel=""nofollow"">this article suggests that espresso is higher in caffeine based on the grind factor</a>; I think there are too many other variables for that conclusion.</p>

"<p>I usually drink double espressos and they always seem to taste much better out of a ceramic cup compared to take-away paper cups. I ordered 2 back to back from the same shop within half an hour yesterday, one in a ceramic cup and one to go (I have a coffee drinking problem...) and the difference was still there - so same barista, machine, beans etc. Why is this? For sushi you are told not to eat it with a metal fork since it will supposedly taint the taste, so could this be similar?</p>
"
"<p>Both <strong>cup material</strong> and <strong>temperature</strong> are in play here, I think.</p>

<p>A big part of the coffee taste (and experience as a whole) is the aroma. I personally find that <strong>paper cups (not surprisingly) <em>smell and taste like paper</em></strong>. Ceramic (or glass, porcelain, etc.) should be practically neutral. Any smell you get from the cup could affect the perception of taste of the contained beverage. If the cup has a plastic lid, that could contribute both to its own smell, or holding-in / reducing the coffee aroma that you smell, also. (Aside: there are some interesting links to the physiology of smell and taste interplay at the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taste"">Wikipedia article on taste</a>.)</p>

<p><strong>The very experience of drinking from a paper cup versus a ceramic cup is different</strong>; heft, shape, handle, other aesthetics, etc., though this probably reduces to personal preference.  For example, I find sometimes that my lip sticks to the outside of the paper cup, which is unpleasant (to me, anyway :). A plastic lid could be a factor here as well.</p>

<p>Temperature may also be a factor. For example, <a href=""http://www.foodnavigator.com/Science/Food-temperature-affects-taste-reveal-scientists"">temperature can affect the perception of bitterness</a>. A properly pre-heated ceramic cup/demitasse will help the brewed coffee be at a consistent temperature (without shocking it after pull) and keep it warmer for longer (so it doesn't cool down too quickly). Such temperature changes could result in a difference in taste; <strong>keeping brewed coffee at a consistent temperature is recommended</strong> -- <a href=""http://www.thecoffeefaq.com/1thebasics.html"">that and some other general properties are listed here</a>. Temperature stability of the brew will probably be different between paper and ceramic.</p>
"
"<p>Keep in mind that paper cups are manufactured. I have been in industrial plants my whole career.  There are odors, vapors and minute particles in the air that get packaged with the product.  They are not harmful per say but are released into the hot beverage on contact and could likely impart a flavor.</p>

"<p>I used to drink lattes every day and realized the milk (lactose) was making me feel bad. I'm looking for a good substitute that will steam well, taste good, and be nice for making latte art. What will get me closest? Soy milk? Lactaid? Unsweetened almond milk?</p>
"
"<p>Just for fun, I will name 3 alternates: Almond, Soy, and Hemp.</p>

<h1>Almond</h1>

<p>Not that good as a milk substitute on taste (better alone), yet a great way to make healthier coffee. As for the health benefits, almond milk has good proteins, calcium and Vitamin D, low sugar as long it is unsweetened. It is rather hard to  make latte art or steam as well for a perfect cup. Also it is hard to make a good cappuccino with this type of milk. If going for health, not taste or looks, go for almond milk.</p>

<h1>Soy</h1>

<p>An excellent substitute for your lactose milk. It compliments coffee very well and is very delicious when put in coffee. It creates a great foam and is easier to have be steamed. It has been criticized though for many different reasons. If you are allergic to diary, never use soy milk or any milk at all really. Soy milk can match the consistency and texture of a good cup of coffee. Soy milk is a forgiving milk that goes with many types of coffee. But it does have a lot of sugar though.</p>

<h1>Hemp</h1>

<p>It is similar to soy milk when it comes to steaming and being a favorite substitute for regular milk. Given that it is very easy to make at home, it provides lots of minerals you need such as 46 percent of your daily calcium and about 900 mg of Omega-3. These ""resources"" are to come by for vegans and vegetarians, so drink up! It has a creamier taste like soy milk and a flavor similar to almond milk, the best combo! Legend says that you can do excellent latte art with this type of milk.</p>

<p>These are the three most popular and favorite milk substitute according to this <a href=""http://www.peacefuldumpling.com/top-3-milk-alternatives-baristas-guide"" rel=""nofollow"">website</a>. I hope this helps you!</p>

"<p>When using the glass-handled 6-cup <em>Chemex</em> like this one:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/Il8CQ.jpg"" alt=""Chemex 6-cup, glass-handle""></p>

<p>and the appropriate <em>Chemex</em> conical paper filter, the filtrate (liquid that has passed through the coffee and the filter) sometimes wells up between the filter and the upper glass cone of the carafe. This slows down the flow of liquid dripping into the bottom of the carafe.</p>

<p>I usually resolve the issue by gently lifting the filter (with coffee and water in it) away from the glass for a second which allows the accumulated filtrate to drop into the bottom of the carafe. So it is not a fatal issue, but I'd still like to know why this tends to happen. </p>
"
"<p>All of your stated options can work well and @PythonMaster covered the pros and cons pretty well.</p>

<p>You stated that latte art and steaming well were important and I didn't see you mention wanting healthy options. In that case I would not recommend almond. It will work ok, but not as good as soy. Hemp is comparable to soy based on your needs but might be harder to find depending on where you live.</p>

<p>Lactaid I think is a good option to try. It will steam well and you can do latte art. It will have a sweeter flavor because of the process that removes the lactose. Soy can be purchased sweetened but can also be found mostly unsweetened.</p>

<p>So I would say either Soy or Lactaid based on your flavor preferences.</p>
"
"<p><strong>Science!</strong> What follows is my bogus hypothesis, with pictures (annotated in the <a href=""http://meta.stackexchange.com/a/19775/262760"">conventional style</a>) and annotations to bolster my unsubstantiated claims.</p>

<p>Other (non-Chemex) cone-style (and basket-style) filters often have ridges down the inside of the cone. It seems that these ridges serve two purposes: to provide channels down which the coffee can flow, and to help ""wick"" the coffee away from the filter. This seems to help the coffee drain faster. This is probably due to properties of water like cohesion, adhesion, surface tension, and perhaps capillary action (legitimacy of these claims is left as an exercise to the reader).</p>

<p>Contrasting the two types of cones:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/wB2fc.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>between a ceramic cone filter (white, left) and the Chemex cone (glass, right). I think the ridges prevent the ""wells"" from forming.  With a flat surface (like the Chemex), the filter somehow ""seals"" itself against the side of the cone, restricting the flow of coffee well enough to cause the pooling you describe. I assume this happens because the grounds get packed solidly at the bottom of the cone, and perhaps expand slightly. I don't have a better answer for ""why"" this seal happens. Lifting the filter (as you describe) breaks the ""seal"" and permits the coffee to drain.</p>

<p>Another way that I sometimes resolve the issue is to slide a bamboo skewer (or stir-stick, or chop-stick, etc.) between the filter and the Chemex cone (careful not to tear the filter!). This seems to work by providing a similar ""ridge"" that the other cone filters provide; it prevents the coffee-pockets from forming next to the skewer. I have also tried to fold little ""pleats"" in the filter, but it's annoying and doesn't work all that well.</p>

<p>I find that this ""pooling"" happens more often when I use a finer grind. I think a finer grind packs itself down more in the bottom of the cone and clogs up the filter more quickly. Both of these could believably cause the ""sealing,"" but I don't have any other real evidence. It also drains more slowly in other drip brewing methods also. For these reasons I use a coarser grind when using the Chemex than when I'm brewing pour-over with the ridged cone filter. In fact, the <a href=""https://bluebottlecoffee.com/preparation-guides/chemex"" rel=""nofollow"">Blue Bottle Chemex brewing guide</a> suggests a much coarser grind than regular filter coffee, like that of French press. Maybe that's for the same reason.</p>

<p>The pour-spout on the Chemex helps with this a little by allowing steam/air to escape from the bottom chamber. A pre-wet filter can sometimes slide down into the pour-spout and nearly seal it, which will also make it more difficult for the coffee to drain, but it sounds like that's not what's happening in your particular case.</p>
"
"<p>Here's another take, but going in the direction more of performance for foam (i.e., more for cappuccino than latte), mostly because I found links about that :) and because <a href=""http://coffeegeek.com/guides/frothingguide/steamguide"" rel=""nofollow"">steamed milk should foam</a>. If you're not looking for much foam, the differences are probably less profound.</p>

<p>There's a few other plant-based milks out there also; coconut and rice weren't mentioned in the other answers. In sum, I know of 5 common plant milks: almond, coconut, hemp, rice, soy. But there are probably others as well. </p>

<p>Here's some comparisons, summarized from the linked articles:</p>

<p>The conclusions tend to be suggest that cow milk will perform better than plant-based ""milks."" This probably suggests that lactose-free milks (i.e., with lactase, like Lactaid and others) will be <em>your</em> best bet. Of course, you could always take a lactase pill and enjoy your cup with conventional milk. Various articles suggest that certain soy milks are best, and that coconut, hemp, and almond will also work.</p>

<p>There's a ton of other factors, but these probably reduce to preference: some milks will be sweetened, or import their own taste (e.g., almond, coconut). Others might have emulsifiers or other additives (such as carrageenan), which impact the steaming (maybe helping or hurting).</p>

<p>Another take would be to look at the ""science"" of what happens during steaming: it's a combination of fats and proteins that are being agitated and changed in the right way to make foam.  <a href=""http://coffeegeek.com/guides/frothingguide/milk"" rel=""nofollow"">This CoffeeGeek article</a> discusses frothing and what's at work; this was interesting for me, and might help you pick a milk based on protein and fat content among the various milk options.</p>

"<p>Though it may not result in any substantial difference in the coffee, hand grinding provides a more analog experience. Speaking just for my self, I enjoy the hands on approach. It certainly takes more time than an electric grinder, but if you're just grinding for a single cup of French Press or Areopress, it's not that much longer.</p>

<p>In general, though, a burr grinder is much better than a blade grinder. It gives you a more even grind, which allows for better extraction. A decent electric burr grinder costs at least $130. You can get a good hand grinder for about half that. For many people, the cost factor is the important one.</p>
"
"<p>You really shouldn't expect to get good crema from the Aeropress. To get a good crema, you need pressure, far more pressure than you are able to generate by hand. I roast my own coffee, so I can brew it within days of roasting. I get a nice foam during the process, but this is different than crema.</p>
"
"<p>Your question has the statement that your blade grinder results in grounds that are equal or superior to the hand grinder in terms of texture.  This is generally not true.  There was a time when I would have agreed with you until a change in my brew method showed me otherwise.  When using my Aeropress inverted, when I began to allow the grounds to extract longer, the large fragments separated from the finer powder and rose to the top of the brew.  They became visible and when I dumped the extracted grounds out onto a paper towel, I was shocked at how many very large - including a few whole beans - there were in the spent grounds.  One side of the spent puck had very fine powder and the other much larger fragments.  </p>

<p>Having learned (from this site) that different flavor profiles from the bean extract at different rates, I could see how a consistent grind would result in a more consistent flavor profile.  I should also say that when I use my blade grinder, looking at the dry grounds, these large fragments <strong>aren't visible at all!</strong>  It's only when they are allowed to separate while brewing that they are obvious.  I would also add that I own one of the higer rated blade grinders out there. </p>

"<p>I am planning some hiking/climbing trips this year so I started looking into portable espresso machines. I found these guys <a href=""http://www.handpresso.com/"">http://www.handpresso.com/</a> and also this <a href=""http://www.wacaco.com/"">http://www.wacaco.com/</a> (this one actually got me super excited and I'm definitely getting one). No idea what the exact differences are apart from the price - The first one is much more expensive. I was wondering whether there are any old school tricks to prepare good coffee on an outdoor trip that don't require you taking too much equipment with you - I would prefer espresso but I realize that this is probably unrealistic. Also, what type of beans would you take on such a trip and how would you store them?</p>
"
"<p>I'm going to focus on the ""old-school"" aspect of your question.</p>

<p>From my perspective/experience, the classic way of producing ""camp coffee"" is a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_percolator""><strong>percolator</strong></a>. To use this device, you put grounds in a basket on the top, water in the bottom, assemble the apparatus, and put it over a heat source (e.g., camp fire, stove, etc.). If you want a stronger brew (as it sounds like you do), you can also use a moka pot (some call this a ""stovetop espresso maker"", though I don't care for that term) -- there are some <a href=""http://www.mec.ca/product/5006-001/gsi-stainless-steel-espresso-maker/"">very <strong>compact moka pots</strong> like this one</a> that are targeted for backpacking/camping. This will give you very good moka-pot-strong espresso-like coffee, but you won't mistake it for espresso out of a professional espresso machine. You get the full experience of brewing a pot of coffee in the wilderness, which I enjoy. See also my related q/a on <a href=""http://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/418/whats-the-difference-between-a-percolator-and-a-moka-pot"">the difference between a percolator and a moka pot</a>. Those are my preferences for camp coffee.</p>

<p>For a little more technology, you can use <strong>integrated heater/container systems</strong> like the <a href=""http://www.jetboil.com"">JetBoil</a>; they also have small accessories like this <a href=""http://www.jetboil.com/Products/Coffee-Press/"">French press insert</a> so you can minimize the extra gear (e.g., you can use the setup for heating water for other cooking, <em>and</em> (separately) use it to make coffee).</p>

<p>On the extreme end of low-weight and low-technology spectrum, you could use <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant_coffee"">instant coffee</a> or try <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B001M05070"">coffee bags such as these</a>, which are like tea bags, except that they are filled with coffee. You could even make your own coffee-bags (see <a href=""http://www.instructables.com/id/Customize-your-own-portable-coffee-bags/"">instructables</a> and <a href=""http://makethebestofeverything.com/2013/07/diy-coffee-brewing-bags.html"">MtBoE</a>). Though there are tradeoffs and <a href=""http://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/19369/why-dont-we-make-coffee-in-the-same-way-we-make-tea"">reasons you might not want to do this, from Seasoned Advice</a>. These single-serve coffee bags have the advantage of minimal clean-up, and the whole package may be compostable. Also you don't have to worry about hot gear if you're packing up to get on the trail quickly (e.g., backpacking). Bags and instant are passable, ultra-light substitutes for actual coffee that get the job done but are less enjoyable to drink (for me).</p>

<p>Storage of beans and/or grounds is tricky -- <a href=""http://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/123/when-does-coffee-go-off"">especially already-ground coffee goes stale very quickly</a>. You can minimize the damage by keeping everything sealed and dry. See also questions about <a href=""http://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/1/how-should-i-store-whole-bean-coffee"">storage in general</a> and <a href=""http://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/1566/how-much-does-keeping-beans-vacuum-sealed-matter"">vacuum-sealing</a>. You could always use <a href=""http://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/1540/why-would-anyone-want-to-hand-grind-their-coffee"">a hand grinder</a>, but that's more gear and more weight.</p>

<p>In sum: <strong>I go ""fast and light"" for coffee on the trail: gear that's reasonably light, that I can use quickly</strong> (for me, this is moka pot) so I can get the caffeine-dose done and get back on the trail. Pre-grind the coffee into a zip-top bag and evacuate as much air as possible. Deal with the slightly-stale taste and focus on being outdoors!</p>

"<p>I answered <a href=""http://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/1509/what-is-the-background-of-brewing-coffee-with-eggs"">a previous question</a> about making <a href=""http://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/1512/what-is-the-process-for-brewing-egg-coffee"">coffee with eggs</a> that might also address your question.  The method is very simple and I see no reason why you couldn't do the same thing without the eggs.  Here is <a href=""http://coffee.stackexchange.com/a/1616/262"">my original answer</a> below:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I don't know any history behind the practice but I learned it myself during a rafting trip down the Grand Canyon back in the early '90's. The method was to put a couple of fistfuls of loose grounds in one of those giant porcelain coffee pots that look like they came out of a Zane Grey novel. Follow with two whole uncooked eggs and with a big metal spoon, stir the whole mess in the bottom of the pot, breaking the eggs and mixing it well with the dry grounds. Fill the pot with cold water and put on a hot fire until the thing boils. Take the pot off the fire and open the lid, dribbling about a cup of cold water over the top of the liquid inside. Somehow this settles all the solids to the bottom of the pot and the coffee really tasted pretty good. My take was that the egg sort of smoothed out any harshness the crude method would have introduced to the coffee otherwise. The grounds pretty much stay at the bottom of the pot and were not really a problem in the cup.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Your method might inlcude a smaller pot and less coffee grounds, but all brew methods are essentially just soaking ground coffee in hot water.  A small French press might also suit your needs just fine.  You should test out your method before you go, though.</p>

"<p>I have a subscription to a roaster who mails me a 250g bag of freshly-roasted, single origin coffee beans every week. To my taste, the beans are best within the first 20 days after roasting after which the aroma declines pretty quickly.</p>

<p>Sometimes, when I travel for instance, I end up with bags that I wasn't able to use by the time a fresher bag arrives. The older beans are not bad by any stretch-- in fact they are still far better than 99% of the beans that are sold in supermarkets which are generally a year old-- but I'd always rather use the fresher beans to make coffee if I have the choice.</p>

<p>Are there any good recipes or preparations that could put these once-fresh beans to good use?</p>

"<p>One option is a somewhat obscure preparation method, but one that works best with older-ish beans: Nel drip (nel pot) preparation recommends beans that are a few weeks old; here's <a href=""https://bluebottlecoffee.com/preparation-guides/nel-drip"" rel=""nofollow"">a Nel preparation guide from Blue Bottle</a>.

"<p>I'm going to answer this in terms of flavor, and then acid.</p>

<p>Generally, people choose more lightly roasted coffee to preserve the terrior flavors of the bean. These flavors usually come from unstable molecules that deteriorate quickly after the coffee is brewed. When coffee is brewed and consumed relatively quickly, the drinker can enjoy those flavors. Cold brew produces a more muddled mixture of flavors and relies more on mouthfeel and big flavors like sweetness, savory, earth, chocolate, etc. More delicate precise flavors are lost. It is also important to note that some fruit, vegetal, and herbal flavors are enhanced by the presence of acid, like adding lemon juice and tarragon to a fish filet.</p>

<p>So, it you are trying to avoid acid but you love the fruitiness of say, a medium roasted Kenyan single origin, you could cold brew it and see if you still get the flavors you want. If you hear about another light roasted coffee that has strong sweetness but is more acidic than you usually like, try it as a cold brew. </p>

<p><strong>I.e. if acid is what is holding you back with specific coffees you want to try, try them as a cold brew.</strong> Just know that the lack of acid in the cold brew may make it a little lack-luster compared to a traditional cup, especially since tasting notes are made when evaluating hot brewed cup.</p>

<p>Darker roasted coffee as already lost more of the bean flavors and gained more roast flavors. If anything, I would say that a darker roast is going to have a more consistent flavor between hot and cold brewing simply because more of the delicate flavors have already been burned away. I would bet that Kicking Horse and Blue Bottle suggest a medium roast for cold brew because a medium roast preserves the beans own characteristics while introducing the roast flavors. This is why single origins are usually roasted to full city or less. </p>

<p><strong>In summary, I would suggest that you find a coffee you like already as a french press or pour over and cold brew that regardless of roast.</strong> Lighter roasts may lose some of their complexity in a cold brew, darker roasts will mellow even more in a cold brew. As backwards as it is, I hope this helps!</p>

"<p>So, I have this GREAT cocoa coffee. It is literally the best coffee I have ever tasted. I know, big statement. Anyways, I recently moved out and had to buy a new coffee pot. :(</p>

<p>Well, my coffee consumption went from 100 to 0 real quick because of the taste I've been getting with this new coffee pot. I've tried tap water and bottled water and it doesn't change anything. It just tastes like.... well it tastes like crap. </p>

<p>Any suggestions on how to fix it? I'd love to drink coffee every morning again without having to pay $2 for a large cup of Biggby's coffee. :-)</p>

<p>(Also, if someone could create a new tag called coffee-pot that'd be fantastic and useful :-) )</p>

<p>It's just a cheap $25 5-cup Mr.Coffee as well! </p>
"
"<p>If you could be more specific with your question it would be easier to answer.  For example was your previous ""pot"" a percolator or automatic coffee maker or what?  By the same token, what is your current set up?  By a process of elimination you should be able to isolate the factor that's causing your coffee to taste sh***ty.  Basically those are:</p>

<ol>
<li>The coffee itself - is it from the same source, being stored the same, same age, etc.</li>
<li>Same water - you said you'd tried different water sources.  Bottled water should yield good coffee.</li>
<li>The method of brewing, which would include water temperature, coarseness of grind, how long it extracts (steeps), cleanliness of the equipment, etc.</li>
</ol>

<p>If all the factors except the method of brewing are accounted for, then the problem is in the brewing method, which would include the coffee maker.  If you know it's clean and it still tastes bad, you need a different brewing method.  Depending on how much coffee you drink, there are lots of options that will yield good coffee.  I have found that the simpler methods (i.e., French press, AeroPress, pour over) are the easiest to control and therefore give you the best chance of getting a good result.  They are also cheaper and easier to keep clean.  Brewing good coffee is actually pretty straightforward so don't give up!</p>
"
"<p>Yes, coffee can be burned when brewing.  When an empty pot sits on the heating element in a restaurant coffee machine it can get very hot.  When the first stream of a new brew cycle hits the bottom of the pot, boils off very quickly, producing a horrible smell and taste that infuses the entire pot. </p>

<p>In addition to the water boiling off, the various organic compounds in the coffee are subjected to temperatures well above the boiling point of water for a brief time, until the volume of new coffee cools the bottom of the pot enough to stop the boiling. Knowledgable staff know to leave a little clear water in the bottom of the pot to prevent the temperature from getting too high before the next pot is brewed.</p>
"
"<p>It depends on the method of brewing.  Brewing methods where grounds are exposed to a heat source directly (Turkish, for example) could allow the grounds to be heated to the point that they started to roast/cook/burn (again).  Most methods of brewing, however, only have the grounds exposed to boiling or near boiling water which is ~210F and less than would be necessary to start cooking/roasting/burning the coffee beans again.  </p>

<p>Many of these other answers actually talk about burning or cooking down stored coffee after it has been brewed.  </p>

<p>As to your question about large chains, my person belief is that the burnt taste most people experience is a branding issue.  Lightly roasted or medium roasted coffee will taste more like the bean it came from, or its origin.  The darker you roast, the more the origin flavors go away and are replaced by the roasting flavors of the bean.  As it so happens, the origin flavors of roasted coffee fade very quickly (sometimes in as short as a week).  However, the roasting flavors seem to hang around a bit longer.  Large chains dark roast their coffee because it makes it easier to consistently produce close to the same taste and the flavor of those dark roasted bean will hang around a bit longer (less shipping and storage concerns).  </p>

"<p>For French Press, my default brew time is four minutes before plunging (i.e. pushing down the filter). I also recommend you pour it into mugs or a separate serving container immediately, so that the grounds don't continue extract at the bottom.</p>

<p>Every bean/roast is different, so adjust accordingly.  If you find four minutes produces coffee that's a little sour or thin, add 30 seconds; if it's bitter, subtract 30. I've found that dark roasts generally need less time, and light roasts need more.</p>
"
"<p>I am a fan of pour-over, generally speaking, and I understand the importance of wetting the grounds, then allowing them to ""bloom"" for 45 seconds or so before beginning the extraction. The main purpose of this is to allow carbon dioxide and other gasses to escape from the grounds, so they can extract more evenly.</p>

<p>I have a coworker who is a fan of French Press, and he does a bloom in the French Press as well. I'm curious if this matters as much in this context, since the grounds are completely submerged the whole time. Is it important? If so, is it for the same reason or some other reason as a pour-over?</p>
"
"<p>It's marketing jargon. In this case, it likely refers to the darkness of the roast, as there is often confusion about difference between darkness of the roast and the strength of a cup of coffee.</p>

<p>In truth, coffee has no ""strength"" until it is brewed. And then, strength is determined by how many solubles you have dissolved into the water. If you want stronger coffee, use more grounds per measure of water. Over-extracting the coffee will make it stronger, but it will also make it more bitter and less pleasant at the same time. (If you're interested, <a href=""https://eatlikeadinosaur.wordpress.com/2014/05/28/how-coffee-brewing-works/"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a> is a more detailed explanation of this).</p>
"
"<p>Brew method doesn't make any difference in caffeine content.</p>

<p>Caffeine generally extracts very quickly from the grounds... as fast or faster than the acids, so you will have most of it in your cup regardless of brew method.  Continuing to over-extract the coffee isn't going to yield any more caffeine, either, at least not in any significant measure. I certainly wouldn't brew over-extracted coffee just in hopes of a little extra caffeine. (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_extraction#Extraction_yield"" rel=""nofollow"">source</a>)</p>

<p>Darkness of the roast does affect caffeine content in way, because it affects the weight of each bean as it roasts. If you measure your grounds by weight (as you should), dark roasts have more caffeine. Though if you measure by volume (as is more common), then light roasts will have more (<a href=""http://www.kickinghorsecoffee.com/en/blog/caffeine-myths-dark-vs-light"" rel=""nofollow"">source</a>). So, for more caffeine, favor dark roasts, but be sure you measure your coffee by weight, not volume, if you're comparing to light roasts.</p>

<p>Some people talk about whether espresso or drip coffee has more caffeine. The problem with this is it's not an apples-to-apples comparison. A cup of coffee has more caffeine than a shot of espresso... but of course it does, it's eight fluid ounces of coffee compared to one fluid ounce of espresso. And if you were to compare equal volumes, the espresso has far more... because it uses about eight grams of beans per ounce where drip coffee is around two and a half.</p>

<p>Which, in a roundabout way, gets to the point: the best thing you can do, if you want more caffeine, is brew it stronger, using any method. And by that, I mean use more grounds.</p>

"<p>I've just purchased a Fresh Roast SR500 home roaster. I have no experience roasting coffee so I'm looking for some basic principles to guide my efforts. After two batches so far, the first, done according to the directions, was horribly undrinkable, and the second, while drinkable still wasn't very good.  The flavor is a somewhat bitter aftertaste. The coffee is described as a wet processed fruity Java bean. I have so many questions I'm not really sure where to begin. </p>

<p>After watching several YouTube videos it seems like every one is different. A professional roasters site advised the roasting time should be between 10 and 15 minutes for all roast levels. But that still leaves the question of how much heat and how to adjust that during the roast. </p>

<p>Are there any straightforward principles for how to adjust the roast in respone to the taste I've gotten from my first attempts?  Or any guidance on differences in roasting light vs Full City which would be the darkest I would do?  </p>

"<p>My latest attempt at creating latte art (admittedly theres still room for improvement).  </p>

<p>My question is, what is causing the crema around the milk to have such a charred look to it?  It isn't immediately noticeable after adding the milk but within a minute after it starts developing that charred appearance.</p>

<p><a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/kcmqQ.jpg"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/kcmqQm.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>
"
"<p>Hard to diagnose just on the back of a photo, but if I had to guess, I'd say the milk is not ""sunk"" properly (i.e. the consistency of your espresso is different to that of the milk). This would also explain why the base of the rosetta is a bit ""murky"". That took me a while to figure out, but I had the same issue (check <a href=""https://instagram.com/p/i3JPUrlnjm/?taken-by=stanimiroff"">this</a> out, then compare to <a href=""https://instagram.com/p/0SNJKLFnuR/?taken-by=stanimiroff"">this</a>). So in practical terms, avoid wiggling the pitcher before a white ""dot"" appears on the surface. Only once the white dot appears on the surface and the stream of milk coming from the pitcher has pushed it further into the cup, should you start rocking the pitcher left to right (good example<a href=""https://instagram.com/p/0Ar4bWgYos/?taken-by=_chris_mg"">here</a> albeit a different pattern). Hope this helps! </p>

"<p>On a recent shopping trip I bought some locally roasted beans from Rwanda, which were labelled ""Karenge"".</p>

<p>The aroma is delicious, but on opening the bag I immediately noticed light-colored matter clinging to the clefts of the roasted beans (click for close-up):</p>

<p><a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/jVKHi.jpg"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/jVKHim.jpg"" alt=""Karenge beans from Rwanda""></a></p>

<p>Upon grinding light-colored flecks are noticeable in their contrast with the dark coffee grounds.</p>

<p>What is this light-colored matter, and does its presence result from shortcuts in the coffee production or processing?</p>
"
"<p>Do you know whether your beans are ""washed"" (""wet process"")?</p>

<p>There should be no problem with the white part. This is typical of washed coffee beans (vs. the ""natural"" beans that are, well, not washed, and the same part is then black).</p>

<p>Also, when grinding beans, there is production of chaff that does affect the taste of the final drink. This should be the light-coloured flecks you have noticed. Although part of the chaff is inevitable, you can try to remove as much as possible to get better results. Chaff is a reason why a good grinder can be important.</p>
"
"<p>What you are likely seeing is the <a href=""http://coffee.wikia.com/wiki/Coffee_bean"">silverskin</a> of the coffee cherry.  Green coffee beans prior to roasting generally still have the silverskin intact/attached.  As the bean expands during roasting and the silverskin dries out, it generally comes off.  Part of the roasting process is some sort of agitation and airflow to remove this chaff.  Depending on the roast level and other mechanical factors, more or less of the silverskin may be removed.  On lighter roasted coffee with less expansion you can often see bits of silverskin along the seam on the bean.  Some processing methods prior to roasting also remove less of the silverskin, ""dry processed"" coffee in particular tends to be more chaffy when roasting and may require a longer time agitating or smaller roast batches to remove chaff.  </p>

<p>Many of my lighter roasts end up with a bit more chaff than I'd like.  Like most anything involving coffee, you can find differing opinions on how much it affects taste.  </p>
"
"<p>Depending on the many variables applied when pulling a shot of espresso, the rate and consistency of the flow of the espresso varies.</p>

<p><strong>Does variable speed or consistency suggest that a shot will be of lower quality? Conversely, does a steady speed and flow indicate that a shot will be of higher quality?</strong></p>
"
"<p>There is a goodish guide for your roaster <a href=""https://www.sweetmarias.com/freshroast_detail.php"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>.</p>

<p>I'd also keep in mind that coffee has a cooling period after you ""stop"" roasting, where it will generally still roast to a darker level (or two). You need to try to finish your roast at a level or so lighter than what you are aiming for and let the coffee ""cool"" into your desired roast.</p>

<p>I might suggest that you roast at a lower level (lower heat) so that the beans move through the stages more slowly.  This will badly suck up your time, but will also allow you greater chance of stopping the roast at the roast level you are aiming for.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that many of the descriptions you read for green coffee are done by people with extremely refined palates.  No matter what coffee you roast, those fruit type descriptions are still hints and notes in the coffee, not it's overall flavor.  Additionally the quality of the green beans you are roasting will affect the final quality of your roast. It's impossible to make poor green beans great by perfectly roasting them.  You can, however, ruin high quality green beans with a poor roast.  </p>

<p>When I started roasting, I was ""lucky"" enough to start with a cheap air popper.  The advantage of that is that with a popper it is very easy to hear the ""cracks"" associated with roasting.  My personal opinion is that the ""cracks"" are one of the few constants with beans that actually consistently indicate roast level. While there are other gauges out there (darkness and smell), they can vary with different varieties of beans.  Eventually I moved to a machine where I couldn't hear the cracking at all, but by then, I had learned enough of the other cues that it didn't matter as much.</p>

"<p>I've been going back and forth between a French Press and an AeroPress for a few weeks now and I can't achieve a great flavor with it yet. I'm pretty sure that I just need to spend more time experimenting so I'd like to ask the community for some advice.</p>

"
"<p>I would recommend using the darkest/burntest roast you can find.  Something along the lines of an Italian or Spanish roast if you can find it.  Then, over extract the coffee as much as you possibly can by letting it steep much longer than normal.  You should end up with a significantly bitter brew.  </p>
"
"<p>A more watery/lighter consistency with a high flow rate is going to leave you with a terrible tasting shot of espresso with too light of crema (this foam on top can tell you a lot about a pulled shot even if it does look as if it came out OK). The opposite applies here to, a super dark and slow pouring shot can occur too.</p>

<p>In my 4 years of coffee house experience using professional grade equipment it all came down to the grind size. You can tell just by the way the shot pours out. If it's quick make the grind a little finer, if it's slow make it a bit more coarse. </p>

<p>And also depending on the temperature in the room can effect the pulls as well, half way through my morning shifts I would have to adjust the grind. </p>

"<p>I own a Gene Cafe and was wondering why many across the internet recommend that the roaster is preheated before the roasting takes place, in comparison to the manufacture which claims that one should just add the beans and start the roasting straight away while everything is cold.</p>
"
"<p>To keep the temperature consistent probably.</p>

<p>Some energy would be spent on preheating the roaster, and temperature will raise at the beginning from room temperature to roasting temperature. If you preheat the roaster it will be consistent all the time. I'm not sure it will affect the result much though.</p>
"
"<p>Bitterness comes from over-extracting the coffee. The factors affecting extraction are: water temperature, time, size of the grind, and to a lesser extent, agitation.</p>

<p>Using hotter water (above the usual 198F-202F), longer steep time, or a finer grind--or any combination of the three--will result in over-extraction, which will make the coffee more bitter. A darker roast will over-extract more easily as well, since an ideal extraction is typically 30-45 seconds shorter than a light roast.</p>
"
"<p>I typically aim to finish plunging at 2:30, using a fine grind and 200F water. But I'm always experimenting when it comes to the Aeropress, and would probably have a different answer in a month.</p>

<p>I found it helpful when I first started with the Aeropress to try out some of the recipes from the <a href=""http://worldaeropresschampionship.com/recipes/"">World Aeropress Championships</a>.</p>
"
"<p>Preheating your Gene Cafe lets you choose between life cycle of the roaster and roasting consistency.  By preheating your roaster, you should be able to get more consistent roast times.  In my case my garage is sometimes 50F and sometimes 80F, so a preheat cycle would certainly probably help.  I don't do it though.  Any machine has a finite number of cycles, and you are shorting that window by preheating your machine.</p>

<p>I roast one and a half pounds a week (a half pound for work, and one pound for home).  The half pound is always done by itself from a cold start.  When I do the pound for home, I do two half pound batches, the first is from a cold start and the second is done immediately following on a ""preheated"" machine.  I try to aim for the same roast level on each of the batches and the second one consistently needs less time to reach the same level.  I generally set a timer and come back 14 minutes after the start.  This allows me to fine tune the last portion of the batch, on cold batches I generally add a bit of time, and on the preheated ones I end up subtracting a bit (to get the same roast).  I am fine with this as it saves me a cycle and will prolong the life of my roaster.  However, I can see that some folks would want the roast length of two such batches to be much closer to the same at the cost of that extra cycle.  For them it may make sense.</p>
"
"<p>When I try following the Aeropress instructions (2 scoops coffee, fill to level 2, stir for 10 seconds, press for 20 seconds), I find that all the water has filtered through before I get to even 10 seconds of very gentle pressing.  Most of the filtering takes place while I'm still stirring.</p>

<p>Am I doing something wrong?</p>

<p>I'm using pre-ground coffee (Tesco decaf).</p>
"
"<p>It sounds as though the pre-ground coffee you are using is not ground fine enough. Generally the more coarse the grind, the faster water will filter through.   You may try throwing some additional grind on your coffee, or buy pre-ground coffee that is more finely ground (although a snob such as myself would never actually advise buying pre-ground coffee).</p>
"
"<p>I think an <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B0047BIWSK"">AeroPress</a> would work great on a trip.  Just need hot water.</p>

"
"<p>The best solution is to turn the Aeropress upside down with the plunger already inserted into the barrel when you brew.  This way, nothing drips out until you flip the whole thing over and start to press.  The process is illustrated <a href=""http://ineedcoffee.com/upside-aeropress-coffee-brewing-tutorial/"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""here"">here</a>.  There are also lots of YouTube videos showing the method as well. With the assembly upside down like this you can let your coffee steep for as long as you want before extracting.</p>
"
"<p>Actually the answer will be completely dependent on the coffee you're using, how finely it's ground, and how dark it's roasted.  I read on a roaster's site (I'll try to find the reference) that acidic flavors come out first, sweet compounds second, and bitter flavors last when brewing.  The trick is to stop the extraction before you get the bitter flavors.  Hotter water and finer grounds will extract faster.  Darker roasts will tend to be more harshly flavored than lighter roasts and a fine ground dark bean with very hot water might be undrinkable.  </p>

<p>I would definitely experiment with your coffee.  200F water is a bit on the hot side, 190-195 is a more common recommendation.  With that temperature, start with 30 seconds, next try 1 minute and so on until you find the ""sweet spot"" so to speak.  There will definitely be a difference in the taste.  The World Aeropress Championships site is a good start but modifying their methods to suit your taste is easy with an AeroPress.  I see you're already using the inverted method which will very definitely allow you to vary the timing.  Good luck!</p>
"
"<p>There is also an alternative to a sachet, which is nevertheless functionally eqiuvalent, i.e., individual serving of instant (but true) coffee. Starbucks sells microground coffee in individual little bags, which is regular decent coffee, but it is so finely ground that it ""dissolves"" in the cup.</p>

<p>However, they only have it in ""selected"" countries -- e.g., I recollect seeing it in the USA and in Poland, but not in some other European countries.</p>
"
"<p>As Keith and Chris note - a darker (as in the darkest you can get) roast and boiling water is going to lead to a (in time, with experimentation, <em>pleasant</em>) over-extraction. Something else you can do is add a pinch of sea / kosher salt to the grinds prior to pouring in the water.</p>

<p>This will <em>not</em> make your coffee salty, it will simply bring out the natural bitterness of the extra compounds the over-extraction will produce. You can use a pinch of salt if you want to back off the temperature of the water, or how dark the roast is, in order to achieve basically the same effect as you would with either.</p>

<p>You have to experiment a bit, I use this method to get a more bitter / robust medium-roast Arabica quite frequently. </p>

<p>Also works wonders in drip coffee filters. </p>
"
"<p>Do you have maker with a removable filter basket? (Like the photo I attached below.) If so, then you might try what I've done:</p>

<ol>
<li>removing the basket</li>
<li>placing the filter</li>
<li>then running water through it</li>
</ol>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/nQFsH.jpg"" alt=""removable mesh filter basket""></p>

<p>The support of the basket protects against failures. And while you won't be able to rinse the reverse side easily, you will be able to get enough water into it to saturate through the paper. (Those flakes you mention will be trapped between the reverse of the filter and the basket.)</p>

<p>Hot versus Cold? I'd use warm. Some things you're removing may be more soluble at higher temperatures. I wouldn't go to the trouble of heating pre-filtered water. there is something to be said for water temperature affecting the filtering qualities of the paper by expanding the fibers, and in turn spaces between fibers. But without testing we'll have to assume it's a minor. If you only have cold filtered water, I suggest you use that. </p>

<p>Why not hot water? First, a quick rinse of hot water isn't going to neutralize significantly more micro organisms that cold. You need boiling or much higher for a length of time to do that. Second, hot water will make the filter more prone to breaking.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I have brewed simultaneous batches with rinsed and non-rinsed; I taste exactly no difference</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This leads me to think that soaking is worth a try. If it works for rice to remove excess starch, it might work similarly with paper</p>

<hr>

<p>A slightly different angle on this: </p>

<p>Try to find the filters that don't need rinsing. When I filter I'm doing so to reduce the cholesterol raising impact of coffee. I prefer the taste of unfiltered coffee, but the evidence convinces me that filtered coffee is better for my cholesterol.</p>

<p>The study linked below, amongst others, shows that paper filters remove much of the cholesterol-raising compounds, as much as ""80% of the lipid-solublue substance that was present..."" Pre-wetting the paper --pre-loading the fibers with water, really-- seem as though it would reduce this absorbent property, although I can't back that up.</p>

"<p>I am trying to understand what causes a commercial coffee machine to be more expensive than a consumer system.</p>

<p>In essence, a coffee machine consists of:</p>

<ol>
<li>Boiler, for the hot water (around 65 °C).</li>
<li>Temperature sensor.</li>
<li>Pump/motor to get the pressure (around 10 bar). (cost: \$390-\$520 USD)</li>
<li>Valves and pipes (to the boiler, from boiler to extraction point).</li>
<li>Pressure gauge, for the coffee extraction . </li>
<li>Relay, measuring the extraction length (around 25 sec).</li>
<li>Precise Temperature, Pressure and Extraction-Time control, via some kind of embedded system, say micro controller.</li>
<li>Chassis, to hold all the parts.</li>
<li>Coffee Taste(Temperature, Pressure, Extration-Time, Coffee Beam Crop) </li>
</ol>

<p>What is it about the components or implementation that make commercial systems more expensive?</p>

<p>Is there something different about the manufacturing process (and therefore price) of each of the separate components?  Or are there additional electrical components contributing to a higher component price? </p>
"
"<p><em>Disclaimer:</em> I have no coffee maker designing or manufacturing experience.  This answer is based on internet research and professional experience.  This answer addresses some of the product design challenges and less of the real engineering challenges, but a lead into the engineering challenges. Based on the question and comment I believe OP is interested in designing a coffee maker.</p>

<p>From a business standpoint most organizations strive to service segments of the market that organizations believe they have a competitive advantage. These organizations also try to offer products to meet opening (OPP), mid (MPP) and High (HPP) price points. Also branding place a significant part in product pricing. </p>

<p>Assumption: US dollar = Euro (Approximately, 1 Euro = 1.09 US$) </p>

<p><strong>Coffee Maker Product Landscape</strong><br>
Based on the above I did some research on <a href=""http://www.foodservicewarehouse.com"" rel=""nofollow"">food services warehouse</a> and selected Grindmaster for this analysis. Base on list price following are the price point classification (Dollars $)</p>

<ul>
<li>OPP: 1000 - 2600</li>
<li>MPP: 3500 - 4700</li>
<li>HPP: 6000 - 10,000</li>
</ul>

<p>Below is a table for OPP, MPP, and HPP price segmentation (April 6th, 2015)</p>

<p><a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/zRxCv.jpg"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/zRxCvm.jpg"" alt=""Price segmentation""></a></p>

<p>Lets assume the following as customer segments</p>

<ul>
<li>OPP: Small office break room coffee machine</li>
<li>MPP: Large office cafeteria</li>
<li>HPP: High traffic coffee shop, Panera, Starbucks, Dunkin Donuts…</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Requirements Analysis:</strong><br>
Flow rate was chosen to keep the analysis simple</p>

<ul>
<li>OPP:  4 - 15 gl/hr</li>
<li>MPP: 15 - 32 gl/hr</li>
<li>HPP:  32 - 50 gl/hr</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Engineering Analysis</strong></p>

<p><strong>Product Design</strong><br>
Consider the Motor (Rotor, Stator, Casting) or the heating element from the BOM. Each of the price points (PP) most like need a different type of component. The component price to meet the above flow rate specification can be significantly different. Also the product volume is each PP is different thus for HPP or even MPP product it is highly unlikely to obtain volume base pricing that OPP might enjoy. Thus explains the cost of components.</p>

<p><a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/nLImt.jpg"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/nLImtm.jpg"" alt=""Example BOM for  coffee Maker""></a></p>

<p><strong>Product Testing, Validation and Manufacturing</strong><br>
The cost of testing, validation and manufacturing will be much higher for MPP and HPP product because the consumer demands for higher quality product compared to OPP products.  Thus the non-recurring engineering (NRE) cost per machine will much higher for MPP and HPP product than the OPP products.</p>

<p><strong>Product Serviceability and Support</strong><br>
An OPP price point product needs very little from a serviceability and after sale support compared to MPP or HPP product. An OPP customer is most likely replace a defective coffee maker with a new coffee make where is MPP or HPP customer will consider maintenance. Also consider a customer like Starbuck or Panera, they demand for high quality, and zero downtime. Therefore the components used in MPP or HPP coffee makers of significantly higher quality than the OPP coffee makers.  </p>

<p>Product Pricing VS BOM price -> General rule of thumb is BOM cost is 1/5 the Product Price. I believe this is a good starting point to figure what take to compete in the intended the coffee maker market. It appears that the coffee maker market is a red ocean. Therefore it important identify the point of differentiation. </p>

"<p>I like drinking my own coffee at work, as it's cheaper and more convienient than buying espresso. However, recently I've been finding myself wanting a more long-black like espresso coffee. </p>

<p>How can I achieve this using either a french press/plunger or a gold filter? </p>
"
"<p>My pour over/drip coffee pot recommends that I measure 10-12g of coffee per person whilst my grinder has markings to indicate whether the ground amount is for 1 or 2 cups. I notice that darker roasts being slightly more oily seem to weigh more and therefore the volume is less compared to a lighter roast so the question is which method of measuring is correct?</p>

<p>I understand that taste is subjective and I have been using 11g so far but given the variability in weight and volume is there a correct method which perhaps can be adjusted for different roast types?</p>
"
"<p>In cooking in general weighting dry ingredients would be much more precise and give you greater control over your variables.</p>

"<p>You <em>can</em> eat coffee cherries, but they don't taste like coffee and have some laxative properties, so you may not want to eat very many.</p>

<p>You have encountered some snacky treats with coffee as a dry ingredient. Those are delicious. They are generally made with coffee beans rather than the coffee cherries; the coffee bean, already roasted, is ground to a fine powder and mixed in. </p>

"<p>I enjoy my homemade French-pressed coffee more than anything I can buy at an espresso shop, though a long black is my preferred choice if I'm away from home.</p>

<p>There are a couple of strengths of the espresso shop's infrastructure which you can emulate on a smaller scale:</p>

<h2>Good coffee beans</h2>

<p>Buy good fresh whole beans and grind them right before you prepare the drink.</p>

<h2>Strong extraction</h2>

<p>Use more coffee and/or grind it more finely. More surface area will make it extract more and taste stronger. You can even make it really thick and creamy and add it on top of water for the long-black-like experience.</p>

<p><a href=""http://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/70/how-can-i-minimize-the-amount-of-grounds-at-the-bottom-of-my-french-press-coffee/"">There's a discussion about minimizing the grounds in your cup here</a>.</p>
"
"<p>I think you are going to have a hard time achieving what you are trying to do with the tools you are describing.  Espresso is a very specific brewing method that produces a very specific type of coffee.  Trying to mimic that flavor profile with other brew methods will generally fall short.  Using more coffee for stronger flavor is one option, but it ends up not being cost effective in the long run.  More extraction is an option, but over extracted coffee often has a flavor profile associated with it that isn't desirable as well. </p>

<p>The closest you can get (in my opinion) on a budget is probably an Aeropress.  It is fairly inexpensive and makes a very strong cup of coffee using a reasonable amount of grounds that isn't espresso, but also isn't over extracted.  The downside is that it's difficult to generate crema with such a brew method.</p>

<p>You might be forced to figure out which aspects of the long black you like, then come up with a brew method that gets you close on those aspects, but is probably missing others that make up the true long black.  </p>

"<p>Tea grown in Sri Lanka is classified by elevation into high, mid and low grown tea. </p>

<ul>
<li>High: rich in flavor </li>

<p>Does coffee has such differentiation? If so what are they?</p>
"
"<p>When I made my first cup of coffee with my AeroPress I couldn't help but notice that it only filled my cup half way. I've watched a few videos on YouTube of people using an AeroPress and from that I've build a short list of ways you can top your cup off.</p>

<ol>
<li>Just add plain water to top your cup off</li>
<li>repeat the entire process (new filter, new grounds and water)</li>
<li>Once empty just add more water on top of the grounds that you just used. (This is the method I use.)</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>In terms of overall taste, what is the best way to get a full cup of coffee from an AeroPress?</strong></p>
"
"<p>My personal preference is to just add a bit of water to top my cup off.  I do not use the inverted method, and by adding additional water during the brewing (since I tend to get just a bit of drippage during brewing) I tend to end up with pretty close to a full cup.  </p>

<p>However, if you are looking for a much stronger (pseudo espresso) cup, the second method may be for you.  It has only really the drawback of using an additional sum of coffee and filter.  </p>

<p>I would not recommend using the 3rd method.  At that point you are just headed to over extracted grounds and a less desirable (by most people) cup of coffee.  </p>

<p>To sum up, you are looking at producing a cup sized quantity of good coffee with method one, a cup sized quantity of Aerpresso with the second and a cup sized quantity of likely over extracted coffee with method three.  Any of these may be fine depending on what you are trying to achieve.   </p>

"<p>Is there a vacuum container that can dispense coffee without letting air in so I don't have to vacuum it everytime I need to make coffee?  </p>

<p>P.S., English is not my first language. Feel free to rephrase the question and correct grammar/spelling mistakes.</p>
"
"<p>I do not believe such a product exists at a consumer level for dispensing coffee.</p>

<p>Hypothetically, you would need a vacuum-sealed container that also incorporates some sort of outlet corridor where the coffee could enter, which would then need to be sealed from the inside before dispensing the coffee. It would be like an ""air lock"" in a miniature coffee spacecraft. </p>

<p>But if this is simply a labor-saving effort, <strong>there <em>are</em> touchless, automatic vacuum-sealed containers</strong> that re-establish the vacuum every time you close it (search <a href=""https://www.google.com/?gws_rd=ssl#q=automatic+vacuum+container"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/?gws_rd=ssl#q=automatic+vacuum+container</a>).</p>

<p>But on a broader note, if you find reestablishing the vacuum each time a bit more trouble than you would like, you might <strong>consider removing a few-days supply at a time,</strong> and just storing what you need in a regular air-tight container for your short-term daily use. Vacuum-sealing is optimal for longer-term storage, but I don't think you will find a <em>perceptible</em> loss of quality over a few days if you keep enough for your immediate needs in a regular air-tight container. </p>

"<p>I'm wondering about the difference between <em>brew</em> mode and <em>keep warm</em> mode in drip coffee makers. After my Black and Decker 2020B finishes brewing, it keeps the heating element warm for 2 hours. Is that different than if it had simply continued to brew for 2 hours?</p>

<p>If I want to <em>reheat</em> my coffee after the keep warm period has ended, is there anything wrong with simply turning it on  to <em>brew</em>? Would that be the same as the keep warm period and thus be fine, or would it cause the heating element to behave differently and possibly burn the coffee or cause a fire hazard?</p>

"<p>It is important to have in mind that altitude is not the only feature that allows one to differentiate the coffee beans. Temperature is perhaps even more important (altitude influences in the temperatures suffered by a coffee plant, but not all the same altitudes mean the same temperature profiles).</p>

<p>As a brief summary (taken from <sup>[1]</sup>), we can say that:</p>

<ul>
<li>Lower elevations (Robusta variety) mean a more intensely coffee flavoured bean (more caffeine).</li>
<li>Higher elevations (Arabica variety) mean more acid and complex taste.</li>
</ul>

<p>So, the main factor is the variety of coffee. The elevation and temperature only tell you what of these varieties you can successfully grow and how you can harvest it.</p>

<hr>

<p>According to this source <sup>[2]</sup>: <a href=""http://www.scribblerscoffee.com/flavor_effect_of_altitude"">The Effect of Altitude on Coffee Flavor</a>, that relates only to the Arabica variety, can be summarized as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Altitude contributes to a coffee taste profile.</li>
<li>Ideal growing conditions for the coffee tree:
<ul>
<li>At the coffee belt (a band extending approximately 30° north and south of equator).</li>
<li>At high elevations, between 3,000 and 6,000 feet and beyond.</li>
<li>These conditions provide a frost-free climate.</li>
<li>Averaging 60°F to 70°F year round.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Cooler mountains provide a slower growth cycle for coffee tree.
<ul>
<li>This means deeper and more interesting flavours (due to a longer maturation process).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Better drainage of soils means less water in the fruit.
<ul>
<li>Further concentration of flavours.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>More fertile the soil, the better.
<ul>
<li>A volcanic soil is often preferred.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The farther we are from the coffee belt, the less elevation we must grow coffee tree in order to avoid low temperatures.</li>
</ul>

<p>As a more specific summary:</p>

<ul>
<li>Generally speaking, more elevation implies a more pronounced and distinctive flavour profile:
<ul>
<li>From the simple, mild and subtle of those grown at 2,000 feet.</li>
<li>To a fruit, spice, floral profile for those grown at 5,000 feet or above (when possible).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

"<p>I would say that using a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cezve"" rel=""nofollow"">cezve</a> to brew <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_coffe"" rel=""nofollow"">turkish coffee</a> has the potential to yield a very strongly caffeinated coffee. The beans are grinded to powder which leads to very intense extraction and it is usually boiled several times.</p>
"
"<p>This is deliberate.</p>

<p>In a moka pot, the downward spout of the funnel does not reach all the way to the bottom of the pot. Brewing will stop once the level of water in the pot falls below the bottom of the funnel (if you carry on brewing after this point, you'll be making coffee with the superheated steam, which will be burnt and bitter).</p>

<p>I'm not sure why this is how it works, but I guess it's to prevent the pot from boiling dry, and retaining a thermal mass in the bottom pot to help it cool down again.</p>

"<p>Normally in a drip coffee machine the 'brew' mode is where the water in the reservoir is boiled/heated and dripped over the ground coffee, before passing through the filter and into the jug. The 'keep warm' part is usually a hot plate under the jug which heats the jug from below, keeping the coffee warm.</p>

<p>My drip coffee machine doesn't allow you to switch it to one mode or the other, you just switch it on and it pumps the water through the filter until its empty - there is a floating switch in the bottom so it knows when there is no more water left, and the hot plate is always on.</p>

<p>I assume that your drip coffee machine works in the same way but has separate controls for the brew and keep warm features. Switching the 'keep warm' feature back on isn't going to harm anything - I'd question the quality of the coffee after 2+ hours sitting on a hot plate though. </p>

<p>A fair amount of instructions I've seen that refer to this step instruct you to stir after adding just enough water to get all the grounds wet. However, there are accounts of people getting the same effect just stirring after all the water is added (in non-drip styles of coffee).</p>

"<p>Several ""automatic pour-over"" machines have recently come onto the market from manufacturers such as those you listed.  They are something of a hybrid between the ubiquitous, conventional ""automatic drip"" machines and manual pour-over methods.  That is, the automatic pour-over machines attempt to perform the same sequence of steps recommended for manual pour-over, but in an automated fashion.</p>

<p>For example, compare the <a href=""https://bluebottlecoffee.com/preparation-guides/drip"" rel=""nofollow"">Blue Bottle pour-over drip guide</a>. This suggests a multi-step process of pouring. With water at a particular temperature, do the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>heat the cone and wet the filter;</li>
<li>pour a small amount of water to wet the grounds and ""bloom"", then wait;</li>
<li>pour the rest of the water slowly in the middle of the grounds pile.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some other guides recommend pouring in circular motions, or in multiple iterations, or at a particular rate, or in certain places.  See also the question about <a href=""http://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/339/pouring-technique-for-drip-pour-over-coffee"">pour-over techniques</a>.</p>

<p>Regular auto-drip machines, on the other hand, simply drop water in one go over all of the grounds in a somewhat uncontrolled manner.  This also relates to a question: does auto-drip taste different than pour-over? That's a separate, open question.</p>

<p>This article from LifeHacker gives <a href=""http://lifehacker.com/automatic-pour-overs-do-they-make-a-better-cup-of-coff-1583005950"" rel=""nofollow"">a comparison between the new-fangled automatic pour-over machines and how they compare to real, manual pour-over</a>, and another from <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/12/16/ottomatic-chemex-coffee-brewer_n_6329320.html"" rel=""nofollow"">HuffPo</a> about the Chemex model. Their conclusions are varied (see article for more) but:</p>

<ul>
<li>they're more expensive than conventional drip;</li>
<li>some models have controllable settings for certain parameters (e.g., bloom time; temperature)</li>
<li>they provide precise repeatability for certain parameters such as rate, contact time with grounds, water temperature.</li>
</ul>

<p>Ultimately, they provide attention to detail that can be done by hand; some do this better than others. However, most just heat water and drip it over the grounds somewhat better than a conventional drip coffee maker.</p>

<p>If you...</p>

<ul>
<li>don't want to learn the ""style"" or ""art"" to manual pour-over, or </li>
<li>if you appreciate the nuances of manual pour-over (over auto-drip), but can't quite focus attention on details that really distinguish manual pour-over,</li>

<p>For fast, automatic laziness -- yielding a quick, easy cup of passable coffee -- you can't beat pod-based automatic machines. Fill the pitcher with water, insert pod, press button... done. The only thing to mess up could be forgetting to place a coffee cup below the spigot. Clean-up is practically non-existent. I personally find the quality of this coffee to be low and unsatisfying.</p>

<p>Otherwise, streamline your French Press routine:</p>

<ol>
<li>Start your water boiling. Go about other business for a few minutes (or stare at the wall if other business is impossible before coffee).</li>
<li>When the water has boiled, grind your coffee and put it in your сafetière (French Press). Add water; submerge coffee. Wait.</li>
<li>Press and drink.</li>
<li>Begin clean-up: dump grounds into compost and allow to dry on its own (a few hours).</li>
<li>Shake out dried coffee and rinse; repeat as necessary.</li>
</ol>

<p>Commentary: </p>

<ul>
<li>This permits really only 3 steps of brewing: boil, mix, press. This is about as simple as possible. By grinding after boiling, this minimizes the amount of time between grind and brew (crucial minutes!) and minimizes the overhead of manual interaction.</li>
<li>By using the multi-step clean-up process that I describe, this maximizes efficiency: get most of the coffee out by shaking when still wet (just brewed). Allow to dry on its own, and the rest of the coffee grounds will come out easily. A simple rinse is enough to get most of the remnants out without clogging a sink drain.</li>

"<p>Blooming is the outgassing of CO2 (carbon dioxide) from the ground coffee in response to hot water being added.  The more recently the coffee has been roasted, the more bloom you can expect.  It doesn't make a huge difference ultimately if this is done quickly or slowly when you brew your coffee.  What I have noticed myself is that it's sometimes diffcult to predict how much foam is going to be produced when the water is poured over the grounds.  More than once I have misjudged the amount of bloom and made a foamy brown mess on my countertop.  If you just add enough water to wet the grounds first, you accomplish two things.  </p>

<p>First, all the coffee is wetted at nearly the same time which better controls how the flavors are extracted, since different flavor profiles extract at different rates.  Sometimes adding all the water at once creates lumps of dry coffee mixed in with the bloom and wetted coffee and it takes a bit of stirring to get all that wetted.  </p>

<p>Secondly, adding a small amount of water controls how quickly the bloom will occur. You'll get most of the bloom done well within the pot and you'll avoid the huge foam ball at the top of your brew that might overflow the pot (or AeroPress in my case), but really this is more of a technique thing than a chemistry thing.  </p>

"<p>I have been drinking coffee for a long time and over the last few years I've noticed that my sensitivity to caffeine has dropped significantly. Nowadays, it basically has no effect whatsoever - I can drink double espressos and go to sleep right away and I also don't feel anything after drinking multiples of those. According to this <a href=""http://www.caffeineinformer.com/caffeine-sensitivity"">http://www.caffeineinformer.com/caffeine-sensitivity</a> I guess that I've become hyposensitive to it (probably due to the abuse of all the coffee machines at my workplace)</p>

<p>It wasn't always like this - I even used to use it as a preworkout while I was studying (in large quantities, but still). <strong>My question is whether someone has had the same problem and managed to increase their sensitivity. If so, how and how long did it take?</strong> There are some tricks using grapefruit juice with coffee because of narangin which improves caffeine absorption or using fat (bulletproof coffee) for the same reason <a href=""https://www.bulletproofexec.com/the-4-secrets-of-getting-wired-on-caffeine/"">https://www.bulletproofexec.com/the-4-secrets-of-getting-wired-on-caffeine/</a> (I haven't tried these yet).

"<p>My new job has me buying my own coffee for the first time in my professional career.  I'm amazed at the amount of coffee I consume.  I brew at my desk using an aeropress.  Has anyone tried to use the grounds more than once?  Any tips as I try it out?</p>
"
"<p>First, what I do; then, the question.</p>

<p>I tend to brew coffee one cup at a time. To avoid waste, I only brew as much as I need, so I usually drink it all.  In order to further reduce waste, I have tried metallic net filters instead of paper filters, but they tend to allow an ultra fine silt to pass through, the presence of which at the bottom of the cup is annoying if the plan is to drink all the coffee.  So, I started doing this: first I place a paper filter in the coffee maker, to collect the ultra fine silt, which is actually very small in volume, and inside the paper filter I place the metallic net filter to collect the actual coffee grounds, which are 99% of the volume. Then, I brew my coffee.  When it is time to make more coffee, I only remove and wash the metallic net filter; the paper filter stays in its place, and gets reused about five times before it has collected so much ultra-fine silt that it is time to replace it.  </p>

<p>Now, the question.</p>

<p>Do you see anything seriously wrong with this technique?  Does it perhaps have any side effects that I should be aware of?  Would such a practice be considered yucky by some?  (If it is, then this is a cultural issue that perhaps I should be aware of.)  Obviously, the coffee smells and tastes fine to me, but I have to wonder whether noses and palates that are more sensitive than mine think otherwise.</p>

<p>I know, it says ""we prefer questions that can be answered, not just discussed"", so if you have something to say, please just state it without starting a long discussion about it!  C-:=</p>

"<p>I also use a paper and mesh filter, but for a different reason.  My drip machine has an attached grinder and came with a mesh filter.  Paper filters leave a gap at the edge the generally results in ground going directly into the pot.  I prefer paper filtered coffee, so I smash a paper filter outside the mesh filter and all my needs are met.  I do however, replace the paper filter each pot I make.</p>

<p>Were I going to try and reuse the paper filter, I would most certainly wash it the same as the metallic mesh filter.  The mud collected on the paper filter has the potential to both change the flavor of the next pot and also to grow mold and contaminate future pots.  If nothing else I would say for hygienic reasons you should be washing the paper filter. </p>

"<p>In addition to what have been said by @Stanimiroff, it could be added that, in general, fine cream with, no bubbles*, can be achieved if the steam is used to <strong>twirl the milk initially</strong> and distribute heat equally in the pitcher <strong>without holding it on the surface too long</strong>. The bubbles are formed either in the beginning, if you keep the steam on the surface for too long or, at the end, if you overheat the milk. Another thing to consider is <strong>how fast do you heat</strong> it, the faster, the more difficult to avoid bubbles.<br>Afterwards you can try to homogenise it by gently hitting  and stirring, but the final result is mostly determined by the temperature (how high it is, how fast it increased). </p>

<p>bubbles*=(reached very high temperature/boiling point)</p>

<p>P.S. rule of thumb for temperature is our (pitcher holding) hand natural heat tolerance, i.e. 60-65 Celsius (140-149 Fahrenheit).</p>

"<p>With a manual espresso machine, I have used the same grounds for two pulls. They are ok in a pinch if I want that volume but don't want to redo the grind, tamp etc.  But honestly it is not as good as the first time through. The only thing I can suggest is that when I do them one after the other, it is ok. If I wait for the grounds to cool it is not really drinkable. </p>
"
"<p>With instant coffee, you are not ""practically eating the beans;"" you are drinking reconstituted dried <em>coffee.</em></p>

<p>To create <em>instant coffee</em> granules, the manufacturer first brews the coffee using conventional methods and then either freeze-dries or spray-dries the coffee to create a soluble powder form. Dried coffee.</p>

<p>The amount of caffeine in the instant coffee will depend largely the original brewing process. Since commercial instant coffee is created in very large volumes, they are likely extracting coffee faster than our meticulous home-brewed methods. So while caffeine is water soluble, it takes <em>more</em> time for the caffeine to be extracted and absorbed in the water than other compounds. And ""more time"" is <strong><em>not</em></strong> something that the mass-produced instant process allows. Less extraction time = less caffeine.</p>
"
"<p>Over the years I developed a caffeine addiction that reached fairly severe levels.  For background, the addiction ramped into high gear the summer after my freshman year of college (summer of '99) when I was consuming somewhere between 60 and 100 ounces of coffee per day.  I tried to quit cold-turkey once, and spent two weeks mostly bouncing a rubber ball off the wall of my dorm room before I decided the addiction itself wasn't even that bad.</p>

<p>Eventually I needed to do something about it, and I went with the only logical method: I <strong>slowly</strong> backed down my consumption, from about five to seven cups per day at the time to a hard limit of two.  I also forced myself to stop consuming any coffee after about 11:00am.</p>

<p>I did all this over a six-week period.  That kept the headaches away, and decreased my dependence on the drug.  However, I had to maintain at that level for several more months -- probably about six or so -- for my sensitivity to caffeine to go back up.  Now, when I drink a cup in the morning, it has the desired effect: it perks me up and prepares me for my day.  It's no longer a crutch, it's simply a pick-me-up I enjoy.</p>

<p>In summary: back down your caffeine intake, whatever the delivery method you prefer, by 10 to 20 percent each week until you reach a more manageable level, then hold at that level for several months.  That will increase your sensitivity.</p>

"<p>Brewed coffee ages like milk.  As soon as it is brewed its flavor begins to degrade and deteriorate, which is why it always tastes much better freshly brewed.  While you may not necessarily taste the difference from one pot to the next, it has definitely changed your overall expectation of the flavor.  The bouquet of coffee also is very complex, as is obvious from the fact that there is a distinct change in the scent from the time you grind to the time the brewing stops.</p>

<p>One flavor issue with reusing paper filters is that they tend to stop a large amount of the oils in the coffee from making it into the final product.  This could be desirable, as many (myself included) prefer the taste of paper-filtered coffee that does not contain the compounds found in the crema (the thin layer of foam on top of espresso, Turkish or French-press coffee).  These, which are often a combination of both sweet and bitter, are trapped by paper filters, but they will break down in the paper over multiple uses and wash into your coffee anyway, but not necessarily in the same form, which further changes the flavor profile.</p>

<p>If waste is a major concern, but you prefer paper-filtered coffee, you can make a compromise and use an Aeropress.  These use filters that are only about 2 inches in total diameter, meaning less gets tossed with each brew.  You could also look into filters made with recycled paper.  It won't reduce the waste, but it will reduce the environmental impact somewhat.</p>

<p>Remember, though, that in the end paper filters are biodegradable and, if thrown away along with the grounds, can actually aid in creation of compost -- a good thing.</p>
"
"<p>In general, I argue that <strong>you <em>shouldn't be able to</em> re-use the grounds.</strong> That is, for any brewing session, your goal is to extract exactly what you want from the beans. If you do this optimally for your method and taste, there's nothing left in the beans that you want; re-extracting will give you a different result. The second brew might be drinkable and even tasty, but it will have a disproportionately small amount of stuff you might want, like caffeine and other flavour compounds. </p>

<p>That said, @Madmanta's answer makes a good point: it might work in some cases, such as Aeropress or espresso. But this suggests <strong>you might want to change other parameters of your brewing</strong>. If you can re-brew your coffee with a result that you like, you might be able to, for example, use less grounds. This saves money, which sounds like it's part of your goal. Alternatively, you could brew a larger cup of coffee with the same amount of beans, or increase the extraction time. In the case of AeroPress, for example, I find that many of the recipes are decidedly under-extracted, so this might be an explanation for why a second brew works for you; see <a href=""http://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/1564/what-do-the-terms-extraction-and-strength-mean"">this Q/A for what I mean by extraction</a> in this case.</p>

<p>You could <strong>try this experimentally</strong> also: brew a cup of Aeropress or pour-over as you usually do, then brew another batch in the same way. For example, I find the last few drops of pour-over brew to be watery and off-tasting but the entire batch tastes better together than either of the two parts separately. If you like it, go for it. Or use half the amount of grounds the next time. :)</p>

<p>As a practical note, you might also consider simply to <strong>brew a larger batch of coffee all in one go</strong>. You'll get a slightly different product but, for example, I find that I use way less grounds for a 10-cup thermal carafe than for 10 individual cups.</p>

"<p>I just had an espresso at a café, and it really put into perspective how weak my everyday coffee is. All the equipment I own is a blade grinder, and my method is a turkish brew (grind the beans, put them in the cup, pour-over some boiling water, wait for it to sink, done!).</p>

<p><strong>What can I do to get stronger coffee?</strong> And more precisely, what will make the <strong>most</strong> difference?</p>

<p>Note that I am not willing to buy any new equipment or machines; I'm asking about what I can do with what I've got.</p>

<p><strong>Update: tried adding grounds onto boiling water, instead of pouring water over grounds. Here's how it went:</strong></p>

<p>TL;DR: </p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> No success, strength did not increase and taste just got worse.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>What I did:</strong> 
I took my strongest beans, ground them as fine as possible, used two identical cups, divided the grounds into two equal portions (on a separate tray). I put grounds first, boiling water afterwards in the first cup, and did the same thing but backwards on the second one. I did not stir any of the cups after adding all ingredients. After quite some time I tasted both cups, I am now finishing them both up while programming.</p>

<p><strong>Observations:</strong>
The grounds on the ""water-first"" cup took a considerable time to sink into the liquid. Even after the brewing time had passed, much more grounds were floating around there than in the ""pour-over"" cup. Also, the water-first cup had almost no foam, which the pour-over cup had plenty of.</p>

<p><strong>Results:</strong>
The water-first cup was <strong>not</strong> stronger than the pour-over; if anything it tasted weaker. The taste was quite different too, water-first tasted a bit stale/watery (not much but there was a clear difference). Pour-over had a rounder and more full aroma, liked that one more. And the crema/foam <em>looked</em> a lot better on the pour-over as well.</p>
"
"<p>I see only one possibility to make your turkish brew stronger and that is using more coffee beans per serving. You are using boiling water and long extraction time so almost everything from the coffee gets extracted leaving you this only option to make it stronger.</p>
"
"<p>A good reason to use a small amount of water when blooming a pourover is to avoid channeling. Water flowing through coffee will follow the path of least resistance, so when you have gaps being formed by CO2 bubbles, some water is going to quickly and disproportionately rush through those low density areas. Degassing as much as possible with a minimal amount of water mitigates the detrimental effects of channeling and allows the coffee to return to a more uniform density before proper brewing begins.</p>

<p>Obviously channeling is not an issue with immersion methods like French press, Aeropress, Clever, etc., so you're unlikely to see as dramatic a difference.</p>

"<p>I actually might say no.</p>

<p>This type of coffee is rather expensive at <a href=""https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=kopi%20luwak%20price"">$100 to <strong>$600</strong> per US pound</a>. Yes, 100 to 600 USD. This is natural Kopi Luwak coffee at a normal price. The word <em>blend</em> sounds a little fishy to me, as it usually means that it is not entirely pure Kopi Luwak.</p>

<p>The thing is, it's really up to you to decide for yourself. If you can trust them, buy it. If you think the product isn't what you want, don't buy it. I will probably say no, but you make the final decision. Go with your gut and say yes or no to buying that product. Good luck!</p>
"
"<p>I'll say yes it's ""real"" and it's ""clever"" marketing.  If one had a coffee plantation with wild palm civets running about, it would be easy enough to have some folks collect some ""civet processed"" beans and roast and blend them with some of your regular stock.  The result of this could be sold with bright stickers to the unwitting for a much higher price to supplement the income from you regular coffee processing.  </p>

<p>Some people might feel this is misleading and I'd agree.  However, I'd say it's far less evil than the plantations that have rows of caged civets and have reduced them to a processing machine.     </p>
"
"<p>There are a few things you can do.</p>

<p>1) More beans.  More beans = more surface area = more extraction.</p>

<p>2) Grind finer.  It's tough to control grind size with a blade grinder, so if you really want a consistent, strong cup, you will eventually want to invest in a burr grinder.  But with a blade grinder, grind it longer.</p>

<p>3) This is the biggest: <em>don't use boiling water</em>. Optimal coffee extraction occurs at temperatures roughly between 185 and 202 degrees F.  You'll need to play with this, because the actual best temperature varies with things like water quality, altitude and, yes, weather.  Those last two are the same reason why recipes often have special steps or settings for high-altitude prep.  I find that, in North Carolina, the best temperature is on the higher end of that range, from 195 to 200 degrees.</p>

<p>4) Finally, don't stir with a metal spoon during extraction.  Metal is a heat sink and will alter the temperature of the water.  Additionally (this is speculation, as I don't have verification for this), the fact that many coffees are at least mildly acidic can also result in flavor changes with a metal spoon if you stir before adding cream.  The cream is basic and will help neutralize the acid.</p>

"<p>Is it possible to regrind beans?</p>

<p>I have about half a bag of very nice coffee in a semi-coarse grind, and I want to use a brew method (Melitta cone) that's more appropriate for a medium-coarse grind.</p>
"
"<p>With a blade grinder, yes.  They already just chop the pieces smaller and smaller until you stop, anyway.  With a burr grinder, it may be.  But I make no promises that it won't clog the feeder.  It's possible that the inflow may be greater than it can handle.</p>
"
"<p>This is a pretty good way to ruin a burr grinder. Worst case scenario, your burrs jam up so much that they can't spin and burn out your motor. A blade could help, but I'd argue that the inconsistent grind you'd get wouldn't be much of an improvement in cup quality anyway. Realistically you'd end up with some of your grinds unchanged, some at the size you want and some ground to dust. The different sized particles would extract unevenly and the dust is likely to clog the filter.</p>

<p>That said, you're not going to break a blade grinder by regrinding, so give it a shot and see how you like the results. At most you're out 20-50g of coffee.</p>

<p>Or in other words, if someone were to eat the grounds without drinking the coffee, could he feel some caffeine effects?</p>
"
"<p>Yup, coffee grounds are simply the ground up seeds found inside the berry of the <em>coffeea</em> plant, <strong><em>so eat up!</em></strong> Even after the beans have been ground and extracted into your favorite coffee beverage, they still contain plenty of caffeine and are perfectly digestible. </p>

<p>Before people learned to brew coffee, folks were eating the beans to get that coffee boost. Today we eat straight coffee beans through all sorts of preparations. Chocolate covered espresso beans are quite popular and pack quite the kick.</p>

<p>Eating coffee beans has even <em>more</em> effect than <em>drinking</em> coffee because not all of the caffeine is extracted through your brewing process. According to the <a href=""http://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/pressroom/presspacs/2013/acs-presspac-january-9-2013/used-coffee-grounds-are-a-rich-source-of-healthful-antioxidants.html"">Journal of Agriculture and Food Chemistry</a>, leftover coffee grounds from filter and espresso-type coffeemakers are especially abundant in antioxidants. Plus, you'll get all the benefit of the dietary fiber that's <em>not</em> present in your morning brew.  Enjoy!</p>

"<p>I had some Kopi Luwak, in Indonesia. I've read a number of reviews. It's been hard to find blind tastings by coffee experts. Basically, it doesn't seem like anything special. If anything, it kind of tastes bad.</p>

<p>Now, there may be more to the story. Indonesians I know have offered two explanations for why I was unimpressed. And these excuses were not mutually exclusive.</p>

<p>One is a lack of certification -- that is, how do you know you were drinking real Kopi Luwak? Hah! Maybe somebody's faking you out!</p>

<p>The other excuse is that, even when it's ""real"", it might be factory farmed. This excuse is based on the observation (true) that Kopi Luwak used to be produced entirely from excreta by Luwak in the wild, who (according to this story) would eat only the best coffee cherries, often from the best coffee estates. These days, lamentably, most Kopi Luwak is produced by shoveling lots of possibly-mediocre coffee cherries into Luwak pens, then raking up what they crap out. Between (1) the stressed condition of these captive animals, (2) a coffee-cherry-only diet (not very balanced), (3) the lower quality of the coffee they are fed, and perhaps (4) slipshod processing by opportunists who don't really know coffee, Kopi Luwak coffee quality has taken a dive.</p>

<p>Or so /that/ excuse goes.</p>

<p>I was suprised to find that Kopi Luwak in Indonesia is not really dramatically more expensive. Maybe 30% more than anything comparable, when I was there last year. That margin might be narrowing. The cachet of Kopi Luwak being ""the world's rarest coffee"" apparently become a selling point in Indonesia, but since the barriers to market entry are low (especially since verification is virtually non-existent), Indonesia is probably approaching an oversupply situation.</p>

<p>At best, if you can identify Real Kopi Luwak, there might be something slightly more appealing about it compared to beans from the same estate that were not, erm, ""processed"" by some wild Luwak ""cherry-picking"" the best beans. More likely, though, no matter what you try, it will just taste how it tasted to me wherever I went: like something pooped out of some poor animal that was suffering from a serious caffeine addiction.</p>

"<p>When brewing coffee with a moka pot, I often leave the lid open so I can better tell when the coffee is ready. Is having the lid off affecting the brewing process in any significant way?</p>

<p>I imagine leaving the lid on will cause the water to heat up faster as the hot air inside the chamber cannot escape as easily, and I wonder if this affects the flavour or general coffee experience.</p>
"
"<p>So what I've been taught is that you should keep the lid open while brewing. This is so you can watch the progress of the extraction, and cut the heat at the appropriate time. It gives you much more control over your brew this way - for example, I cut the heat (and run the base under the cold tap for larger pots) as soon as I see the coffee running from the spout turn lighter, rather than waiting for the gurgle.</p>

<p>However, as for lid open/closed during brewing, I don't imagine this has any effect on the extraction. The amount of heat lost will be tiny in comparison to other variables.</p>
"
"<p>Not sure about the effect on the brewing, but I found out a good reason for the lid. I was brewing some coffee on the stove and had the lid open. The liquid started pouring into the top chamber. ""This is great!"" I thought, ""Why would anyone ever close the lid, you're missing the best coffee fountain show ever?"" Then at that moment, the 'last gasp/sputter' of coffee happened and sprayed hot coffee all around the pot and onto the stove top. That's one good reason for the lid.</p>
"
"<p>By 'blended', I think what they're trying to tell you is that it's not single-source. It's <em>really</em> hard to say from the packaging, but I think you're going to be getting 100% Arabica from several different farms, and that's not uncommon.</p>

<p>An average farmer yields <em>less than one kilo per day</em>, so getting a single-source supply of this is quite difficult.</p>

<p>From the see-through portion of the packaging, it looks like the average quality / roast that you'd find on the shelves in most Philippine grocery stores. It's worth a try, looks like it's over-roasted for <em>my</em> tastes, but it lets you explore a really good coffee at a less than prohibitive price - why not? </p>
"
"<p>I've had this <em>on the farm where it was harvested</em>, and was able to verify for myself that wild, happy civets were left to their own selection process and merely followed around by farmers eager to find the drops.</p>

<p>It's not unlike any other Arabica bean. What I had was single-source, but that's rarer - farms doing it <em>correctly</em> don't produce a lot, so packagers and marketers will usually buy from dozens. That brings me to the first thing that determines the taste of it:</p>

<h3>The Roast</h3>

<p>Some farmers roast themselves, others just sell the beans. Many sell directly to people <em>and</em> to packagers, so unless you get it single-source, you're probably going to have a bag of beans roasted anywhere from blonde to nearly dark. If you're serious about tasting it, find a place that offers single-source, or roasts their own. You want it <em>just at</em> the second 'crack'. A comparable color is a Starbucks 'blonde' roast, or the usual color of illy in the red can.</p>

<h3>The Brew</h3>

<p>I've had it two ways, as espresso and in a press. I <em>prefer</em> to have it in a press, despite not getting nearly as much crema. A coarse grind, hot clean water and about 4 minutes to brew. <strong><em>Drink it immediately with a clean palette</em></strong>. Make sure you're not thirsty, make sure you're not hungry, and make sure there's nothing going on with your taste buds other than the coffee. You want to sip slow and enjoy it. Don't let it get cold, but slow down.</p>

<h3>The Taste</h3>

<p>While debates are quite hot regarding whether or not the civet's digestion of the bean adds anything to flavor, I'm quite confident that the selection process <em>does</em>. Good Arabica coffee is known for the subtle nutty / caramel hints, and you know it when you drink this. I couldn't detect any difference in acidity, but the flavors that the bean is known are definitely more present than usual. This makes a lot of sense given the selection process, civets are <em>very</em> picky cats.</p>

<p>But, that's not to say that a very discriminating and trained picker couldn't get you something close. In fact, illy (red) comes <em>very</em> close to the same quality and presence of flavor undertones that I've experienced with alamid (kopi luwak).</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>Don't raise your expectations <em>too</em> high, it's not really <em>that</em> much better than any other very high quality Arabica. You're paying for the process (make sure you're dealing with an 'honest' source) as much as you are the quality of bean, novelty and experience.</p>

<p>It tastes very good, but so do the illy beans I grind every day. </p>

"<p>I'm learning about Colombian coffee and its <a href=""http://www.coffeereview.com/coffee-reference/coffee-categories/geographic-origins/coffees-from-the-americas/colombia/"">national grading standards</a> of Supremo (highest) and Extra (second highest). Does anyone know what percentage of all beans produced falls into those two categories? What happens to the beans that don't make one of those two grades?</p>
"
"<p>They get sold for less money as ""standard export"" grade coffee.  Because of NFC's marketing campaign, ANY sort of Colombian coffee ends up with higher brand recollection than most other coffee.  There is a slightly slanted view of the matter <a href=""https://www.sweetmarias.com/library/content/colombia-0"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>.  The writers are coffee aficionados who prize distinctive origin flavors in their coffee, which is rarely present in NFC graded coffee since they are more often than not mixed batches of beans from different growers.  That isn't to say that the NFC's work doesn't ensure high standards for Colombian exports, but it isn't favorable to some sectors of the coffee market who prize distinct coffee from a single origin.

"<p>I'd give oat milk a try. I had an oat milk latte on the weekend and it was surprisingly good. The milk texture was the closest to normal milk I've had. I did not steam the milk myself (had it at <a href=""http://www.talkhousecoffee.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">Talkhouse Coffee</a> in London), but judging by the latte art, oat milk would definitely appear superior to soy and almond milk (microfoam-wise). Oat milk is also high in protein and fiber content and has cholesterol reducing abilities, so it seems you can't go wrong :-)</p>

<p>Having said that, if I were you, I would consider significantly reducing the amount of milk I consume instead of substituting/completely cutting it out. Having <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cortado"" rel=""nofollow"">piccolos</a> keeps your milk intake to around only 3oz per serving, while you still get the full velvety flavour of normal milk (and you can pour some pretty decent <a href=""https://instagram.com/p/uNZL1wlns0/?taken-by=stanimiroff"" rel=""nofollow"">latte art</a> too ;-)) </p>

"<p>Hello all I started making instant coffee for the last few months. Due to a combination of laziness and lack of a proper coffee maker. I find that I actually enjoy instant a lot. Normally the process is 2 teaspoons of coffee, add boiling water and then creamer. My question is does the taste amplify if I add creamer before adding the boiling water thus transforming the coffee molecules in a different order? </p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
"
"<p><strong>Edit 02/26/2016.</strong> I am now convinced that resting the beans is necessary. There are just two many roasters I've heard from (on here and in person) that believe it is necessary, and I have seen with my own eyes changes in the appearance of the beans a day after the roast (they seem to darken a bit).</p>

<p><strong>Previously (while still unconvinced).</strong>
John Snow's and Nathan's answers sound very plausible, but I'm still not convinced that resting fresh-roasted coffee (past the point of cooling) improves its brewed taste. As far as I can tell, no one has ever proven this. DISCLAIMER - I don't <em>want</em> to believe it, because I think brewing after roasting is fun. But I will eventually listen to reason if strong enough arguments present themselves. Below are a couple of points that allow me to remain in disbelief.</p>

<p>There's a guy on YouTube <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYyVGuluuaU"" rel=""nofollow"">claiming the resting fresh-roasted coffee principle is a myth</a> due to a mistaken case of cause and effect from unskilled coffee shop employees. He goes so far as to tell his own myth of a teenage kid (suffering from acne - nice touch) who sees his employer resting the beans and makes the conclusion that they're better after they sit. But really, the employer is letting the coffee rest because it's impossible to brew large amounts of really fresh roasted (it will explode or something) and the teen is just too lazy to ask. He just wants to smoke weed.</p>

<p>Now if you're not convinced by the explanation above, the only scholarly source I could find is Michael Sivetz's <em>Coffee Processing Technology</em>, Volume 1, where on <a href=""http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015002932617;view=1up;seq=268"" rel=""nofollow"">page 248</a> he writes, </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Beans cannot be ground directly after roasting as they are too soft and would be crushed, flattened, and scarred. When the beans are cool, hard, and brittle, they may be ground.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So I just have to cool them down? Ok, I may be extrapolating a bit since this book is about getting coffee to the masses. And it's very old.</p>

<p>Finally, I'm not a scientist, but I just don't see how carbon dioxide escaping from a bean is going to change the flavor of brewed coffee, especially considering the bean is about to be pulverized and soaked in near boiling water. </p>

"<p>What are my options for milk frothing? From what I can tell, baristas just use part of the ""big coffee machine"" (please excuse my rookie terminology; my national drink is tea :D) and don't have a separate device for it.</p>

<p>I'm only an occasional coffee drinker, so I don't want to invest in something that costs $100 just to froth milk.</p>

<p>A full answer with all the possible answers ranging from perfect but expensive to inferior but cheap would be best.</p>

"<p>If I order a caffè latte from a coffee shop, will it always be the same strength? As in the same ratio of espresso to milk? For example, I think I heard that Starbucks UK use more espresso than is normal, though I can't remember if that's compared to ""normal for a latte"" or the other Starbuckses in the rest of the world.</p>

<p>Or does it vary wildly from shop to shop (and thus I need to learn or ask at each individual coffee shop)?</p>
"
"<p>They sell tiny triple-A battery frothers on Amazon for under ten dollars. You can also find them at a kitchen supply store. They look like a wire with loops on the end that spin when you flip the switch/press the button. Put it in your hot milk, and froth it as much as you like.</p>

<p>As for what cafe's use, their espresso machines will have a module that does it for them.</p>
"
"<p>I wouldn't say it would amplify it, and you may very well not be able to tell much of a difference. Unless the milk or cream is hot, your coffee won't brew very well (or at least not as fast) on just the milk alone. So by the time you add your hot water, it still shouldn't have dissolved the instant coffee enough to make much of a difference.
If you wanted to experiment, I would try adding some hot cream or milk to the instant coffee first and stirring it up a bit. Still probably wouldn't make much of a difference other than it tasting more like a latte. </p>
"
"<p>From what I have found the only rule to make latte macchiato is to use at least 200ml of milk for a 30ml espresso shot. 
Clearly this is mostly defined by the volume of the glass the coffee is served in and that will definitely vary from shop to shop. 
I would expect the coffee shops to use standart espresso shots but no one can be sure about this either.</p>
"
"<p>Since you want to amplify the taste I would suggest using water that is just about to boil (95°C). I don't have experience with creamer but when I used to drink instant I have always added sugar before water because it helped the coffee to dissolve better. You should experiment with this by using even lower water temperature and watching the dissolution process with and without the creamer.</p>
"
"<p>It varies by shop and order.  For instance, order a latte at Starbucks, you have a selection of sizes, and then variance in the number of shots (or espresso) you order in the drink.  Since the sizes are not doubled (12, 16, 20 ounces, not 12, 24, 36) and half shots are not a thing, the ratio will vary at the order level.</p>

"<p>I have seen coffee prepared as in Qatar: It was mixed with cardamon, and had a light brown colour. The taste was excellent. I was told that the coffee beans were roasted only very little. Which kind of coffee beans are typically used for this coffee in Qatar, and can one get them in Europe.</p>

"<p>There are now a variety of systems using single-serving coffee pods or capsules. But what happens to the capsules after they are used?</p>

<p>What are these capsules actually made of? How much of the materials can be usefully recovered for recycling?</p>

<p>How widespread are recycling facilities? Presumably it will vary depending on the system and country etc.</p>
"
"<p>Keurig have publicly stated they are switching to using fully recyclable materials by 2020 (I have no idea why it will take them five years to implement something most companies have been doing for decades, but that's beside the point).  You can see more at <a href=""http://www.keuriggreenmountain.com/en/Sustainability/SustainableProducts/OurProducts/ReducingProductWaste.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">their Web site</a>.  You can also get Keurig-compatible (although not ""approved"") pods that do not have the outer plastic.  They are just an upper ring, a foil cover and a filter with grounds dangling loose.  While some of these make great coffee, I am told they go stle rather quickly if you don't have a tightly sealed container in which to store them.</p>

<p>Flavia/Alterra have their own recycling program.  I don't know about home-use situations, but at least for managed, corporate-use programs, their single-serve packets can be recycled using the packet-disposal boxes they provide.</p>

<p>I can't speak to other single-serve manufacturers.</p>

"<p>I finally noticed that the chaff collection unit is actually several pieces that don't fit as well as they could.  I took it apart and sealed the seams with high temperature engine gasket sealant.  I then used the sealant to connect the vent hose to the top of the chaff collector (also a very rough fit). </p>

<p>I still have some problems with cold air inflow on the vent through the house wall, but I can disconnect the vent hose from the house vent and stuff it with rags or other temporary insulation material if I choose.</p>

<p>All said and done the machine is leaking far less than half the smoke it was previously.  It seems the chaff collector was a main part of the problem.  This makes sense as the exhaust there is making a 90 degree turn, expanding into a chamber, then compressing back into another pathway.</p>

"<p>If you only use a double (14g) portafilter basket then you're best to use a 58mm convex tamper. This is because if you look at the basket, in most cases, the sides will slope in. Therefore, if you had a flat 58mm tamper then the you are compressing to outer more than the inner. Obviously the whole point of tamping is to compress the grounds consistently throughout the whole puck, so this would achieve this the best. If you want to use a flat tamper for any reason in this situation, you would be best using a 57mm flat tamper and tap the edge of the portafilter to knock any loose grounds back down into the basket and then rotate the tamper over to produce a flat surface for the water to pass through.</p>

<p>If, however, you are using a single (7g) portafilter basket then the 58mm tamper would probably be too wide to compress the grounds evenly as it may not go far enough down in the portafilter basket to tamp it at all. Therefore, you would be best using a 57mm tamper. </p>

<p>If you're using a triple basket then a 58mm convex rules would apply the same as the double basket.</p>

<p>This is all based on the assumption that the basket is 58mm. This is the most common size but other sizes do crop up, commonly on older machines which may use a 53mm basket. In this case the flat/convex rules still apply, just with the smaller diameter.</p>

"
"<p>Blade grinders are a bit easier to clean.  Generally you can simply wash out inside and it doesn't require the disassembly cleaning a burr grinder does.</p>

<p>Blade grinders are also less likely to be damaged by inappropriate use or coffee that contains foreign objects (it's been known to happen as urban myth).   </p>
"
"<p>No.  Coffee is often offered to people perhaps about to pass out so that they will stay awake long enough that they can be kicked out of an establishment.  </p>

<p>Alcohol causes dehydration, electrolyte imbalance and taxes the liver.  To this extent standard medical treatment is fluid, electrolytes, and vitamins.  Caffeine is never used in a medical setting to treat alcohol overdose or withdrawal.  </p>

"<p>Caffeine is not that only drug that can raise blood pressure.  In fact many other drugs are much better at raising blood pressure and have fewer side effects.  If you are asking specifically about the chemicals in coffee, then yes, caffeine is the likely culprit if coffee causes raised blood pressure in an individual.  </p>

<p>Tea and chocolate also contain caffeine, but of course lower concentration than what is found in coffee.  Eating large amounts of chocolate or drink large quantities of tea could have a similar effect to drinking moderate amounts of coffee.</p>

"<p>A hangover is the body reacting to being poisoned. Coffee, like any other liquid you might drink, will help with the dehydration. If your drunkenness has caused you to sleep in, and you normally drink coffee every morning, your headache may be worsened or partially caused by caffeine withdrawal, so a cup of coffee will improve that. And if you're feeling queasy, and take cream and sugar in your coffee, it's a way to boost your energy a bit without eating solid food.</p>

"<p>By now I have found out the method to prepare Khaleeji coffee as it is called. People drink it without milk or sugar.</p>

<p>Ingredients:</p>

<p>3 cups water</p>

<p>3 tablespoons ground coffee from Emirates</p>

<p>1 tablespoon ground cardamon</p>

<p>5 to 6 cloves</p>

<p>1 finger tip saffron threads</p>

<p>1 teaspoon rosewater</p>

<p>Method:</p>

<p>Boil water in frying pan. Add coffee. Cover and boil for 10 minutes. Add cardamon and cloves and boil for three more minutes. Remove from stove and let it cool for one minute without stirring. Put rose water and saffron into a thermos bottle. Add coffee via a sieve. Wait 5 minutes. Then the coffee will be ready to drink.</p>
"
"<p>okay,the easiest way to do that is by taking some coffee(decoction or the refined coffee powder) and sugar in your cup.
If you have taken ground coffee and sugar- then the next step would be to add little amount of room temperature water. Don't add to less that you see a hard glob and don't add too much that it becomes runny.
If you're adding decoction ,then skip adding the water.</p>

<p>Now,all you do is take a spoon and start beating the mixture in the cup-just like you would beat eggs for omelettes.
The color will lighten up- it goes from dark coffee brown to muddy brown.Also it attains the consistency of whipped cream but slightly fluid.
Then add hot milk. Stir with a spoon,the froth comes up and voila you have your frothy coffee !!</p>
"
"<p>They aren't <em>just</em> frothing the milk, they're also <em>stretching</em> the milk. Stretching it is what gives a latte its unique texture (though the micro bubbles add to that). If you want a good latte, focus first on stretching it - you can use a small whisk to get air into the milk if need be.</p>

<p>You want a small stainless steel pitcher, most look like this:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/bnlis.jpg"" alt=""pitcher""></p>

<p>Put 2/3 of the amount of <em>cold</em> milk you actually want in your latte in that, then put it on a heat source (small burner is okay). Hold your hand around the pitcher while it heats, and use the other hand to stir the milk. You can also use one hand and just swirl the milk around in the pitcher - do what feels comfortable, just keep the milk moving. </p>

<p>As soon as the pitcher becomes <em>just less</em> than too hot for your hand, pull it. Swirl it around a little bit and look inside. Does the milk have a kind of gloss to it similar to Elmer's glue (or any other paste you used in school)? If not, Put it back on the heat for 20 - 30 seconds, swirling it as you do. Once it's got that gloss, and the milk has expanded a bit, it's stretched properly.</p>

<p>An electric burner is ideal for this, but there are also metal overlays for gas burners that just provide a hot surface.</p>

<p>At that point you can use a hand whisk, or any number of the frothing gadgets that you can find in any cooking store (brick-and-mortar or online). </p>

<p>You can, of course, just froth the milk, but what you're essentially doing is aerating it. That's fine, it's going to make a tasty drink, but it might fall short of your expectations if you don't <em>stretch</em> the milk as well. The process is what makes the milk and the coffee fall in love and give birth to a latte.</p>

<p>The steam wand on espresso machines heats the milk <em>and</em> adds the air, giving you a lot more control over the process. However, this will work almost as well. </p>

<p><strong>Tips:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Don't ever let the milk get close to simmering. It'll burn very quickly. </li>
<li>Use the handle if you have to put the pitcher back on the heat (as naturally, you took it off because it was approaching too hot to hold)</li>
<li>You want to get the milk <em>in</em> the coffee as soon as possible once it has that gloss. Don't let it cool down too much while frothing (work fast)</li>
<li>It's going to take some practice</li>
</ul>

<p>Total for this would be about $15 for the stainless steel pitcher, $10 - $15 for the frother, so all total around 30 bucks. You could use a sauce pan, but it's <em>much</em> harder to gauge how hot the milk is if you do, and much harder to control when you pour. </p>

"<p>The crema definitely affects the initial taste of the coffee, that's where the concentrated notes of whatever bean you're using is going to be found. </p>

<p>I make a long black by:</p>

<ul>
<li>Pour 3/4 cup of hot water (right from the machine)</li>
<li>Wait 2 - 3 minutes</li>
<li>Pull a double shot into it, holding it <em>right</em> under the group to minimize splashing</li>
<li>Let sit for about 30 seconds, serve</li>
</ul>

<p>In contrast, I make an Americano by just pulling a double shot into a cup while also taking care to minimize splashing, then I serve it with a small steel or ceramic carafe of hot water (everyone likes a little more or a little less than everyone else).</p>

<p>In both instances, I heat the cup, and that's important because the crema will quickly break up on the walls of the cup if you don't. Most good espresso machines allow you to heat cups on the top of them. </p>

<p>Now, my testing is somewhat limited because I drink good quality Arabica beans pretty much exclusively. Arabica has some subtle flavors and it's easy to tell when they're more pronounced. Long blacks <em>do</em> hit the caramel notes more, in my experience. But, I usually just make myself an Americano because it's easier and the taste isn't all <em>that</em> different. </p>

<p>Done at home using a <a href=""http://www.brevilleusa.com/the-barista-expresstm.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Breville Barista Express</a> in manual mode. You don't really need a super expensive machine to replicate this, you just need the ability to pre-infuse, warm the cup, and be able to wrangle one under the group to minimize splashing. </p>

<p>Concluding, I think there's some substance to this. However, I'm not sure how much it really matters to someone kind of fumbling around to get their first cup of the day. It took close to a dozen tries to finally get a process down where the taste was noticeable and I could reliably reproduce it. </p>

<p>If you order either at your average coffee shop, I don't know that you'd be able to tell the difference, I never have. </p>

"<p>You can use a blade grinder for nuts and spices as well, provided that the 'chamber' and blades are 100% stainless steel. It's pretty easy to clean the oils that would otherwise affect your next batch of beans.</p>

<p>That's not the case with a burr grinder, especially the ceramic variety - a hand-full of hazelnuts in one of those will mean <em>anything</em> coming out of it picking up that taste for quite a while.</p>

<p>I use my blade grinder mostly for that these days, since I own several burr grinders. Great at grinding up peanuts, dry corn kernels, dry spices and that sort of thing.</p>

<p>To clean it, I wash it with a moist cloth as usual and then use a moistened antiseptic towelette (like they use to wipe your skin with prior to giving you an injection) - there's no trace of what I just ground in it once I'm done.</p>
"
"<p>From the book <a href=""https://books.google.com/books/about/Coffee.html?id=IqJsIcYOPcQC&amp;hl=en"" rel=""nofollow"">Coffee: A Guide to Buying, Brewing, and Enjoying</a>, I remember reading that if you use flavored coffee beans in a burr grinder, that flavor is not going to come out, ever. But with a blade grinder you can grind flavored beans, clean it out, and use it again with unflavored beans.</p>

<p>They take up less space than the burr mills than I've seen. An exception would be <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B00INJE7FE"" rel=""nofollow"">this little guy</a> but if you want a fine grind you'll be cranking for a long time. </p>

<p>I'm under the impression that, for drip or pour over, the extra consistency of a burr mill doesn't make a huge difference. That is, while a finer grind will get you more extraction, a little variability in the size of the grounds is not the end of the world. </p>

"<p>About three weeks ago, I brewed iced coffee in a clean jar; I didn't drink all of it and left it in the refrigerator.</p>

<p>About 1/2 the jar was filled, I then traveled and when I came back, I found in the bottom of the jar something sticky like rubber.</p>

<p>Is this Kombucha ?</p>

"<p>I can read Arabic and also I prepare Arabian coffee as you want, so here comes the recipe </p>

<p>1- you have to get a very fine ground, light roasted plain coffee 1tps / 80 ml water
2- ground cardamom 1/8 tps
3- saffron
4- 1:2 cloves / 80 ml
5- rose water 1/2 tps / 80 ml</p>

<p>A lot of arabs drink it plain instead of sugar they eat dates along with it but you can add sugar if you wish; set your pot on a very very low heat, let it boil.</p>

<p>Turn the heat off and transfer it to another pot, wait until the grounds settle down the pot and pour, have fun.</p>
"
"<p>In order to be Kombucha, you would need to have a starter, unless (somehow) enough bacteria was present in the coffee / sugar / cup (highly unlikely). It would also be <em>extremely</em> unlikely that even if a culture was unwittingly introduced, that it would bloom in cold water. It's not Kombucha unless it's actually fermented, and for that, you need a live, active <em>thriving</em> culture (you must have a starter).</p>

<p>What you've <em>probably</em> got at the bottom of the cup is a combination of settled sugars and residual grounds. While I doubt that tasting it would be harmful, I wouldn't quite recommend it :)</p>
"
"<p>The most important distinction between blade and burr grinders is the result:</p>

<p><strong>Blade</strong></p>

<p>Coffee beans circulate across the spinning blades. No matter how long or short the grind, there is extreme heterogeneity in particle size--that is, you will find larger bean fragments with near-dust-size ones, with everything in between.  If you use a pour-over or drip brewing method, you might even see whole beans floating to the top. Not surprisingly, you'll get very uneven extraction from these different particles, no matter what the brewing method.</p>

<p>If you grind long enough to decimate all the beans, you'll find a lot of fine coffee dust and sediment in your cup. Too short a grind, and you get a lot of beans and bean pieces that can't present enough extractable surface area to the hot water, leading to a thin, weak cup. Waste of coffee, to be sure.</p>

<p>Also, it's almost impossible to grind any two batches consistently, since grind time is dependent on bean quantity, type of roast, variety of bean--well, <em>everything</em>.  So today you'll get a disappointing cup, and tomorrow you'll get another disappointing cup for some other reason. Therefore I recommend a <em>Conical Burr</em> grinder.</p>

<p><strong>Conical Burr</strong></p>

<p>Beans move through <strong>once</strong>.  When you set your burr grinder to a certain fineness, there will be very little heterogeneity in particle size.  (N.B.  Spend more on the grinder, get a more even grind.)  This allows you to experiment with the grind as well as the quantity until it's perfect for you, then replicate that recipe perfectly every time.</p>

<p>Some tips on finding the right burr grinder for your needs:</p>

<ul>
<li>Prices vary from $50 to $1500 for non-commercial grinders.  I'm happy with my $350 Rancilio, which I've had for 10 years without a hint of trouble.</li>
<li>How you like your coffee matters.  A more expensive grinder will do better fine grinds, as for Arabic-style (i.e. Turkish, Greek, Lebanese) coffee.  If you don't drink that, don't spend more for it.  Most burr grinders perform best in the automatic drip range.</li>
<li>The under-$100 burr grinders still manage to throw a lot of fine coffee dust into the grind.  Do your research before buying.</li>
<li>Consistency in grind is critical to good espresso.  If this is important to you, be prepared to spend as much on the grinder as you spent on your espresso machine.  It's for a good cause.  Why hobble your good machine with sub-par ingredients?</li>
</ul>
"
"<p>I'm wondering what makes Turkish coffee made out of original Turkish packed grounded coffee taste so differently (better) from what I can do from beans that I ground myself or in the shop, following basically the same technology? </p>

<p>I had a few hypothesis:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>It's all has to do with right <em>Cezve</em>, i.e. pot. However, buying
'true' Turkish coffee pot didn't help. Actually I get much better
results with Turkish ground coffee comparing to the one sold
by weight even if the latter costs more.</p></li>
<li><p>They add cardamom to the coffee. I tried it, coffee tastes better, but
it's still not the same.</p></li>
<li><p>They ground it very very finely. I asked the seller to ground my<br>
coffee ad fine as they can but the result is still poor. (Actually this 
is still an open question, because they can use better machines than the ones I have access to.)</p></li>
<li>They use special coffee mixes.</li>
</ul>

<p>Then in Wikipedia I read that it is mostly about fineness of the grinding, but burr mill and mortar proposed there didn't work in my case. I also bought turkish coffee mill like this: 
<img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/3JaVQ.jpg"" alt=""Coffee mill""></p>

<p>I tried to grind the coffee with this mill many times, results are always poor. Does anybody know what is the secret? Can I make my own coffee that would be the same quality (or better) than, say, <em>Mehmet Efendi</em>?</p>
"
"<p>How long do they retain their qualities? In the coffee store near my home the seller told me that their coffee beans are stored for 1-3 months in their shop. But after purchase I'm also storing them for a few weeks.</p>
"
"<p>I assume you are storing them for a later grinding (likely just before preparing your cups of coffee).</p>

<p>According to some sources <sup><a href=""http://www.ncausa.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=70"">1</a>,</sup><sup><a href=""http://lifehacker.com/5239098/the-coffee-geeks-guide-to-storing-beans"">2</a>,</sup><sup><a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2009/05/for-better-coffee-store-your-beans/16690/"">3</a></sup>, the main point is <strong>use it within a week</strong>. For more than that, it is preferable to freeze them, and in this condition, for no more than a month.</p>

<p>A brief summary:</p>

<p><strong>For short term use (this week's coffee):</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Do not refrigerate your daily supply of coffee (in order to avoid moisture).</li>
<li>Keep them in air-tight glass or ceramic containers, in a dark and cool place.</li>
<li>Keep only the amount of beans you know you will quickly use.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>For long term use (no more than a month):</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>If you have a large amount of beans, wrap them in small (weekly) amounts inside air-tight bags, and freeze them. Once removed from freezer, do not return them.</li>
<li>If you are making coffee in an espresso machine, let them getting room temperature for one day.</li>

"<p>I've heard some people say not to use distilled water in pour over coffee because the lack of minerals will negatively affect the taste. Is there any evidence for this? How specifically does it affect the flavor and does the same apply to water filtered by reverse osmosis?</p>
"
"<p>Flavouring a coffee involves introducing flavour oils to the beans after roasting. </p>

<p>I am assuming that the shelf life of an object is measured as the minimum shelf life of its components, so is it possible for these flavour oils to reduce the longevity of the roasted bean, or do flavour oils have as long, if not longer shelf lives?</p>

<p>By shelf life, I mean the length of time before it is unsafe for consumption. Whether the flavour of flavoured coffee degrades at a different rate to unflavoured coffee is most likely a whole new question entirely.</p>
"
"<p>You are quite right - the flavouring does indeed change the shelf life in a certain way. It is necessary to look at this from two perspectives.</p>

<h2><strong>Shelf Life by Safe Consumption:</strong></h2>

<p>The flavouring compounds used to flavour coffees last longer without degrading. This means that they <strong>ARE NOT</strong> the limiting factor when it comes to the shelf life of a coffee. <strong>Therefore, shelf life is not changed by flavouring the coffee as these compounds degrade (or go bad) after the coffee itself.</strong></p>

<h2><strong>Shelf Life by Taste:</strong></h2>

<p>Because the coffee has been treated with flavouring compounds, it will hide certain aspects of degradation of the coffee due to aging, decaffeination, and oxidation. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In addition, these flavors help extend the shelf life of coffee by
  disguising changes in flavor due to decaffeination, oxidation, or
  aging processes.</p>
  
  <p>Source: <a href=""http://www.madehow.com/Volume-3/Flavored-Coffee-Bean.html"">How Products are Made</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Therefore, shelf life by taste is changed, as the flavouring compounds mask the degradation and therefore the bad tastes of the aging coffee.</strong></p>
"
"<p>Due to the fact that this is a lengthy question, I will try to be concise and to the point.</p>

<p>In short, yes, all of these main types coffee makers use a different type or size of filter. Sometimes each type can use a different filter. I will provide a non-exhaustive list of filter types for these coffee makers which you have listed. Although the list in non-exhaustive, it will provide the main types of filters for each device.</p>

<h2>Understanding Permanent versus Paper filters</h2>

<p>A permanent filter is often made out of metal and is, in most cases, a mesh (not true for espresso machines). They are not disposable and are made to be reused many times.</p>

<p>An impermanent filter is generally made out of paper and is disposable and is generally not meant to be reused.</p>

<h2>Drip Coffee</h2>

<p>Drip Coffee machines are one of the most common coffee machines for home use. The filter used will either be paper or permanent.</p>

<p>A paper filter for the drip coffee machine will either be flat-bottom or cone-shaped depending on the make and model of the coffee machine.</p>

<p><strong>Flat-bottom filters:</strong></p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/YIiwu.jpg"" alt=""Flat-bottom Filter""></p>

<p><strong>Cone shaped filter:</strong></p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/ntWce.jpg"" alt=""Cone shaped filter""></p>

<p>The permanent filter can take the same shapes, however it is generally a flat-bottom shape yet can be a hybrid between a cone shaped and a flat-bottom shaped filter. I can only describe this as an upside down triangular prism. Below is a picture of the aforementioned hybrid filter.</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/CvRrn.png"" alt=""Hybrid cone filter""></p>

<h2>Single Cup</h2>

<p>These filters are generally made out of paper and are usually a cone shape which is usually specific/unique to the type of single cup brewing device.</p>

<h2>French (Push) Press</h2>

<p>A french or push uses a permanent filter which is made out of a fine metal mesh. It is on the bottom of the plunger. The entire bottom of the filter has three main parts, shown below.</p>

<p><strong>The Parts of a French Press Filter:</strong></p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/xrAHF.jpg"" alt=""French Press Filter Parts""></p>

<h2>Espresso Machine</h2>

<p>An espresso machine's filter is called a portafilter. It shaped like a small basket, made out of metal, and has small holes in the metal on the bottom. There are three sizes. The most common are the single and double shot filters and a rarer one is the triple shot filter. They increase in size to hold more ground coffee.</p>

<p>There are generally three types of portafilters in circulation with mainstream home espresso machines.</p>

<ol>
<li>Single wall. This is the most common in the industrial setting. It is contains only one wall on the bottom of the filter.</li>
<li>Double wall. Think about this as a portafilter for the inexperienced and is most common for the home espresso machine. It has a secondary wall on the bottom of the portafilter with only a few holes in it. The presence of two walls helps to regulate extraction pressure and is therefore good for those who are not very good at tamping pressure and grind size.</li>
<li>Pod filter. This is simply a specially designed filter that is the same shape as the others and comes with some home espresso machines. They are used to hold pre-made and pre-packaged espresso pods that one simply drops into the filter and can avoid many of the other steps of traditional espresso brewing such as tamping and grinding.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Portafilters (single wall) on left and baskets (which hold them and are upside down) on the right:</strong></p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/ZeKtK.jpg"" alt=""Portafilters""></p>

<p>The filter on the left is a single shot and the filter on the right is a double shot.</p>
"
"<p>It appears specific models are under the Keurig 2.0 label.  The K250, K350, K450, K550 will be clearly marked Keurig 2.0, which use the label DRM.</p>
"
"<p>I know light roasts tend to have these flavors more. How can I brew to maximize these flavors? I use an Aeropress, but any answers are useful.</p>
"
"<p>I've noticed that most (non-specialty) places that sell coffee tend to have very dark roasts. This includes Starbucks, any Fast Food restaurant, most nicer restaurants, and hotel coffee.  </p>

<p>I can't tolerate anything darker than Starbucks' ""Blonde Roast"". All their others I'd consider to be dark roast. When I buy coffee in the store and make it myself, it's never anywhere near as dark as what you get in shops. I usually get fresh beans from The Fresh Market or Caribou brand.  </p>

<p>Is there any reason shops tend to make their coffee so dark? Or is my taste just skewed from most people's?</p>
"
"<p>Roasting coffee dark may be used because it is easier to create a consistently flavored bean, with less monitoring and concern for flavor profiles. In the case of Starbucks they are shipping so much of their coffee to so many locations and creating so much coffee at once that it may be easier to create consistency. The darker you roast the less the flavor of the original bean matters, so it may also be used as a method to roast cheaper or lower quality beans.</p>
"
"<p>Lighter roasts are going to have more of these flavors but it obviously depends on the bean as well. If all you are going to change is the method of brewing the coffee, I would recommend making sure you don't use too hot of a water temperature and trying to use a pour over. I find pour over allows for more delicate flavors you are describing, rather than something like aeropress which can approach more espresso type coffee.</p>
"
"<p>I had the same question as well. The Mahklonig scale is from 1 (fine) - 11 (coarse), based on some images, so you could assume that 7.3 is about a drip grind, and then adjust to taste based on results</p>
"
"<p>I was given an old moka pot (this one in particular is a Junior Express pot) and noticed this buildup in the water well - it seems to be a little different from the typical scale buildup that I googled (it's grainy, thick, and hard). It has a metallic odor to it that seems to affect the flavor of my coffee. Is this just normal scaling, or something else?</p>

<p>I know that people feel really strongly about not cleaning these things, but I think I may have to in this case since it's affecting the flavor of the coffee. If you do think I have to clean it, what would you recommend for clearing this buildup out?</p>

<p>For the record, this was after I brewed a cup this morning, so it looks darker than it did before. The buildup had some white in it.</p>

<p>Also, how often/how do I know when I should replace the rubber gasket? I have no idea how old this thing is.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance for your help!</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/GYglD.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>
"
"<p>If it's in the water well then it's most likely mineral deposits from hard water OR oxidation. I think the sentiment against cleaning is in regards to detergents and the pot should be rinsed with water and let dry thoroughly to avoid any oxidation in the future. If the problem is mineral deposits it is just due to the water used in brewing and is not a major problem.</p>

<p>I would try to use something acidic such as vinegar to clean the pot and attempt to get out any minerals out. Cleaning it definitely can't hurt if it's affecting your flavor.</p>

<p>As for the gasket, if it looks worn out or the metal is damaged I would just replace it when you have a chance. They are fairly cheap and it isn't too difficult.</p>
"
"<p>Due to the fact that the spots are picking up the colour of the coffee, it sounds to me like they may be scales from minerals in the water being used. This is normal occurrence for almost every type of coffee maker.</p>

<h2>When NOT to clean your Moka pot</h2>

<p>In daily use, do not use soap and water to clean the pot. This is because oils from the coffee will build up in the pot and contribute to the flavour of the coffee for each concurrent use. Just rinse with warm water, let it dry, and put it away.</p>

<h2>When to clean your Moka pot</h2>

<p>If you don't use your Moka pot daily, these oils will build up but become rancid over time. If you don't use your pot daily, it's a good idea to give it a scrub with soap and water every now and again.</p>

<h2>When to DESCALE your Moka pot</h2>

<p><strong>It seems that your Moka pot may have some hard mineral deposits, called scaling, inside the pot.</strong> There are multiple ways to descale a coffee machine. You can use a vinegar solution, lemon juice solution, or you can even buy coffee descaler from some supermarkets.</p>

<p><strong>Recipe for lemon juice and vinegar solutions:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>50 warm water, 50 percent vinegar. (Do not inhale any fumes)</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>OR</strong></p>

<ol start=""2"">
<li>25 percent lemon juice, 75 percent warm water. (Safer and more pleasant)</li>
</ol>

<p>Notice: Don't boil these solutions as the fumes can cause damage to your eyes and respiratory tract.</p>

<h2>When to consider throwing out your Moka pot</h2>

<p>If your flavour is still affected after you descale it, you may be dealing with some rust. If you happen to notice any rust inside or your coffee just has a strange taste after some amount of time and many brews, you may need to consider getting a new one.</p>

<p>Good luck. If you have any questions, feel free to post them or comment here.</p>

"<p>From time to time, I find myself somewhere, where I have to make coffee using a drip machine. Often it is one that takes flat-bottom, paper filters.</p>

<p>When I am in this situation, I am usually working with a weak coffee. To strengthen the taste of the coffee, I reason that using two paper filters instead of one will increase the extraction time of the coffee (which I prefer in this setting).</p>

<p><strong>My question:</strong></p>

<p>Will using two paper filters actually have a significant change on coffee extraction time? Or is the difference insignificant? </p>
"
"<p>Coffee is fresh only for about 7 days from roast. I tried keeping in cool place, freeze and many more options but did not help too much, so I decided to get a coffee roast machine and just roast as much I need for the 1-2 days. All this is from my experience, not from books or anything else. If coffee is out for couple weeks or months than is not tasting and does not have potency as should have. </p>
"
"<p>Yes, because it allows more time for coffee to be extracted as it stored in a longer time for coffee to drip. However, other parameters also have effect regarding this issue (such as, type of bean, roasting profile, temperature, brewing method)
But using double filter since it also filter the ""flavor"", making it stale (you may lose the pleasant acidic, fruity flavor, or other unique flavor your bean may offered) and double filter can make your coffee over extracted thus unpleasant bitter flavor. 
If you want your coffee strong you may want other experiment</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Use fresh coffee bean</strong>
the older the coffee, they tend to lose their flavor. The fresher, the better. You have to store your bean properly too, keep it in air-tight container, avoid direct sunlight</li>
<li><strong>wait  to grind your bean, until the last minute</strong> coffee lose a bit of its flavor after grinding. Ground coffee is also more sensitive to the moisture</li>
<li><p><strong>Use different kind of bean</strong> You may use robusta, it naturally has more ""caffeine"" compared to Arabica, therefore can ""hit"" you harder</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Use different kind of roasting profile</strong> the darker the roast, the bitter it is, but it has less caffeine.</p></li>
</ol>

<hr>

<p>when brewing</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Pre-warming the equipment or insulating it</strong> basically the hotter the temperature you get bitter flavor, to avoid the ""upleasant bitter"" you may adjust the water temperature according to your preferences. Temperature loss often occurs as a result of heat absorption by the equipment itself (and therefore stale flavor), so pre-heat the equipment would prevent it</li>
<li><strong>Use finer grind</strong> Coarser grind can make your coffee under extracted</li>
<li><strong>Adjust the amount of your coffee</strong></li>
<li><strong>Adjust the steeping time</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>In the end it comes down to your preference(s). No single technique is right for everyone. Enjoy your coffee immediately after brewing</p>

<p>My explanation might not answer your question directly, double filter affect your coffee, yes it is. But other factors simply can be neglected</p>

<li>Its flavor, specifically the oil that can be squeezed out, complements the flavor of espresso, although if this is the case I'd like to know why.  It would seem counter intuitive to me that you would want to add more acid to an acidic beverage, but I guess milk is slightly acidic too.</li>
<li>Its flavor covers up imperfections in bad coffee and/or poorly prepared espresso.</li>
<li>It is simply a garnish to make the presentation more appealing to the eye.</li>
</ul>

<p>Maybe one more more of these contributes to serving espresso with a lemon peel?  Maybe something else?</p>

"<p>Wanted to know if anyone has a really good, possibly verified method of controlling shot preparation and extraction with an unmodified Gaggia Classic espresso machine.  I don't have, nor do I want to add a PID.  </p>

<p>So, what is your method?</p>
"
"<p>Assuming that:</p>

<ul>
<li>you have found the <strong>best available beans in your market</strong>.</li>
<li>which are then <strong>finely grounded</strong> </li>
<li>and <strong>used instantly after the grounding</strong> (have in mind the finer the grounding the faster the coffee taste deteriorates as it both absorbs humidity and all smells from the environment with it and in the same time releases its aroma). </li>
</ul>

<p>You can look for: </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>right Cezve</strong> : the pot shouldn't be a steel, as the temperature rises very fast which leads to bitter/ burnt taste. The preferred material is copper. </li>
<li><strong>right preparation methods</strong> : make it as slower as possible and wait for it to create a thick cream (caimác) that will protect its aroma as in espresso. To achieve that you can use either direct flame (as you can directly see the flame and control the amount of heat transfered):</li>
</ul>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/78CyA.png"" alt=""enter image description here"">
<img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/i5Zcw.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>or sand (which has large heat capacity and it takes a lot of time to get hot): </p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/p9qWV.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>steer it frequently till it boils</strong>: to homogenize it perfectly; otherwise the coffee and sugar go down on the bottom and melt/ burn and deteriorate the taste.</li>
</ul>
"
"<p>The best way to control of shot extraction without adding excessively complicated electronics (if by PID you mean proportional-integral-derivative controller) is:</p>

<ul>
<li>How fine is the bean grounding (the finer the grounding, the higher the density -> the slower the extraction).</li>
<li>Applied pressure on the grounded beans in the machine group head (the higher the pressure applied (similarly) -> the slower the extraction).</li>
<li>pressure and temperature are also important parameters to be concerned before moving to PID control (for example your extraction time/lenght could be longer but if the temperature of the water is low, there won't be excessive essential oil extraction). </li>
</ul>
"
"<p>Possibly the same reason as serving alcohol with lemon/ orange/ etc peel, but if you are drinking high quality coffee the same rules apply as in high quality alcohol, namely, no additional supplements, additives, admixture or any other impurities (that will lead to losing of the high quality taste characteristics which will be totally covered by the, let's say lemon peel or sugar for example), are advisable.</p>
"
"<p>The problem with coffee beams is the same as with any other product that has open/direct contact with the environment: </p>

<ul>
<li>oxidation (contact with oxygen): covering all the aroma under a heavily bitter taste.</li>
<li>humidity absorption: smell and taste circulating in the surrounding of the coffee will be imprinted in its taste as it will be diluted in the water vapours and absorbed from the beams. (This phenomena if especially important after the grounding, for example if the barista is smoking or heavily using deodorants etc, all of these will be imprinted in the coffee taste).</li>
<li>loosing aroma through evaporation/drying (as temperature changes during the 24 day, during the hotter hours it will dry and the rest absorb).</li>
</ul>

<p>That is why coffee companies make everything possible to pack and isolate the beans/ powder once baked. <em>Illy</em> for example insert nitrogen gas to prevent oxidation, etc.</p>
"
"<p>In addition to what have been said: </p>

<ul>
<li>easier to maintain consistency as quality is lower.</li>
<li>longer preservation.</li>
</ul>

<p>It could be added:</p>

<ul>
<li>it gives more intensive taste (possibly local market demand and standards). </li>
<li>allows greater dilution. </li>
<li>possibly smaller dose in the shot extraction.</li>

"<p>I've long been interested in how long caffeine stays in my body and what are the effects at different concentrations and times. For example, a popular site <a href=""https://www.erowid.org/plants/cannabis/cannabis_effects.shtml"">erowid has metabolism curves for most illegal drugs</a>, along with side effects. However, it's caffeine entry is mostly anecdotal experiences. </p>

<p>Here's an example of what cannabis metabolic curve looks like: <img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/MluJ6.gif"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p><strong>Is there a similar metabolic curve with onset, total duration, peak, plateau for caffeine?</strong> Does the kind of coffee consumed affect the curve?</p>
"
"<p>Most medications approved by the FDA and used in a medical setting have such statistics.  Caffeine is no exception.  Most drug databases have listed pharmacokinetics for caffeine.  Onset is listed as 15 to 45 minutes with peak concentrations as 30 minutes in adults.  Half life for caffeine varies based on a number of factors.  For adults it is listed as 4 to 5 hours, however, studies suggest it is generally less for smokers.  It is much much longer for infants (52 to 96 hours) but generally by nine months of age, those numbers have dropped to similar levels seen in adults.  </p>

"<p>After making a big batch of cold brew, I'd like to be able to keep it around for an extended period of time-- one month, let's say. Assuming I keep it in an airtight container in the refrigerator, how long will my batch of cold brew remain fresh, flavorful and bacteria-free?</p>
"
"<p><strong>From anecdotal experience freshness and flavor begins to fade within ~7 days with regular storage methods</strong>. Many people brewing cold brew online state between 5 days and 2 weeks is okay to keep cold brew for. In my opinion you will have coffee that you won't want to drink long before you run into harmful bacteria <em>as long as you are keeping things sanitary</em>.</p>

<p><strong>How you store the coffee will determine how long it keeps</strong>.
To improve storage look into bottling it in individual bottles with little headspace, or even kegging the coffee. Exposing coffee to oxygen will negatively impact flavor and expose coffee to more bacteria. Creating a concentrate of the coffee may help to prevent bacteria from forming. Splitting batches up into multiple sterile containers and keeping them sealed may also help it to last longer. </p>

<p><strong>Getting your coffee to last you a full month is almost definitely going to be much more of a hassle than brewing coffee more frequently.</strong> The taste will always be better from fresher coffee and cold brewing coffee is one of the simplest methods. Unless you absolutely can't make coffee more frequently I would recommend making smaller batches you can consume quickly.</p>

"<p>I have been experimenting with iced coffee lately as summer has started and I haven't really had any good results. The coffee always tastes...different then what I believe it should taste like. What factors could attribute to having good iced coffee? </p>

<p>I have tried many different K-Cups but they all seem to have the same effect. </p>

<p>Any suggestions? </p>
"
"<p>Iced coffee, specifically drip brewed coffee poured over ice has a few things to consider with respect to taste. </p>

<ul>
<li>It has the acidity of regular coffee, often making it harsh(er) to drink, cold brewing can reduce this acidity by 70% but also potentially leave some of the flavor a behind in the coffee</li>
<li>It will be diluted since the ice will melt leaving you with a weaker tasting drink. Often this is compensated for by doubling the strength of the hot brew and letting the ice dilute to normal strength</li>
<li>Supposedly (although I've never tried it), the Japanese iced coffee method is a middle ground between iced and cold brewed coffees. In this method, hot coffee is brewed directly over ice instantly cooling it locking in the full flavor of hot coffee, but oxidizing much less. </li>
</ul>

<p>Often it comes down to taste what in particular might work to make your iced coffee better. A different bean type or roast level, maybe on that is slightly less acidic or more bold may give you the flavor you are looking for. </p>
"
"<p>The main difference between the ceramic and plastic V60 is heat retention. The ceramic will retain heat and can be pre-warmed, creating a stable temperature. Depending on who you are this may not make a huge difference but I prefer the ceramic as I feel the plastic sucks some heat out of the water/coffee.</p>

<p>The other reason I prefer ceramic is for cleaning purposes. The ceramic is nonporous and I've used mine for 6 months with no residue or stains whatsoever. The plastic can form build ups from minerals in water or coffee and start to appear visually unappealing (not sure if it will affect flavor of coffee)</p>

<p>The plastic V60 is obviously more durable and resistant to bumps and minor drops, so it can be a portable solution for coffee. However the ceramic V60 is the most visually appealing of the V60's (in my opinion) and it stays at my home on the counter so I prefer it. I believe the grooves inside the brewer and the size of everything is identical, so you can't go wrong with any of them. </p>

<p>Taken from the abstract of the review paper in case you don't have access: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Unfiltered coffee is a significant source of cafestol and kahweol, which are diterpenes that have been implicated in the
  cholesterolraising effects of coffee. The results of epidemiological
  research suggest that coffee consumption may help prevent several
  chronic diseases, including type 2 diabetes mellitus, Parkinson’s
  disease and liver disease (cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma).
  Most prospective cohort studies have not found coffee consumption to
  be associated with significantly increased cardiovascular disease
  risk. However, coffee consumption is associated with increases in
  several cardiovascular disease risk factors, including blood pressure
  and plasma homocysteine. At present, there is little evidence that
  coffee consumption increases the risk of cancer. For adults consuming
  moderate amounts of coffee (3–4 cups/d providing 300–400 mg/d of
  caffeine), there is little evidence of health risks and some evidence
  of health benefits. However, some groups, including people with
  hypertension, children, adolescents, and the elderly, may be more
  vulnerable to the adverse effects of caffeine. In addition, currently
  available evidence suggests that it may be prudent for pregnant women
  to limit coffee consumption to 3 cups/d providing no more than 300
  mg/d of caffeine to exclude any increased probability of spontaneous
  abortion or impaired fetal growth.</em></p>

"<p>Due to the age and usage of your Keurig machine, I would say that you are experiencing two possible problems - one at a time or perhaps both.</p>

<p><strong>The Problems:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p>The motor in the pump in your Keurig machine may simply just be getting worn out. If this is the problem, you should be able to hear it struggling to pump water out through the K-Cup. If you need a comparison, try comparing it to a newer model and see how it sounds. If de-scaling (see next problem) does not work, then you may need to replace the motor/pump. It may just be easier at that point to buy a new Keurig machine.</p></li>
<li><p>The machine seriously needs to be de-scaled. I would recommend running a solution of 25% lemon juice and 75% water through the machine. Make sure to run around 250 - 500 mL (about one to two cups) of this solution from the tank all the way through to a cup. Then rinse with atleast 1 L of of normal water (about 4 cups).</p></li>
</ol>

<hr>

<h2><strong><em>CAUTION:</em></strong></h2>

<p>As I have stated in other answers, breathing the fumes from this can be extremely dangerous for your mucosa (parts of the eyes, nose, mouth, throat, respiratory tract, and lungs). Do not breathe in the steam or fumes. </p>

<p>This is not a huge concern with lemon juice (which is why I recommend it), but if you were to use vinegar or a commercial de-scaler, this would be a huge concern. </p>

<p>Just be smart about it. You don't want to end up with permanent damage to your respiratory tract.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Other possible problems (harder to fix):</strong></p>

<p>It could be possible that a seal somewhere in the pump has worn out and air is entering the system as it is being pumped. This would involve replacing a seal and taking the machine apart though.</p>

<p>There may be some other component, that I can't think of, that is damaged. Try the above solutions and leave a comment. Let me know if anything works.</p>

"<p>When making Bulletproof Coffee, is there a good way to blend the butter or coconut oil well to prevent the oil floating?</p>
"
"<p>Preparing instant coffee is basically pouring hot water on dry coarse powder made out of a coffee drink.</p>

<p>Is it still called brewing?</p>

<p>It seems like a language shortcut, as the brew happened before making the instant coffee powder.</p>
"
"<p>I think there are 2 questions here. The first is why oil and water don't mix. The second is why oil rises, as opposed to sinking or staying in place. </p>

<p>First question. There is an old saying in chemistry that like dissolves like. What this means is that a substance tends to dissolve in another substance if the molecules of the 2 substances have similar electric dipole moments. Think of an electric dipole like you think of a magnet. The magnet has a north and south pole, and south end of one magnet is attracted to the north end of another magnet, and vice versa. The electric dipole has a positively charged end and a negatively charged end. The magnitude of the positive charge can be greater than that of the negative charge, or vice versa. The difference between the magnitudes of the 2 charges and the distance between them determines the moment or strength of the dipole. In general, dipoles with similar strengths dissolve in each other more readily than dipoles with very different strengths. Oil (as in hydrocarbon-based oils) and water have very different dipole moments, so oil and water do not readily dissolve in each other. </p>

<p>The second part of the answer has to do with a force called the buoyancy force. This is the force that causes some objects to float in water. Suppose you want to dissolve 1 cubic cm of oil in water. For this to happen, the oil has to displace 1 cubic cm of water. The buoyancy force on the oil is equal to the weight of that 1 cubic cm of water. Oil is less dense than water, so 1 cubic cm of oil weighs less than 1 cubic cm of water. Therefore, the upward buoyancy force on the oil, which is equal to the weight of water displaced, is greater than the downward force of gravity on the oil, also known as the weight of the oil. This inequality of forces causes the oil to rise in the water. If the oil were denser than the water, the oil's weight (the downward force) would exceed the buoyancy force (the upward force), and the oil would sink in the water.</p>

"<p>The times I have made it, I have used a blender (something similar to a bullet).  You won't ever get it completely mixed in, and it will separate, but you can get a pretty good dispersal to start by using a high powered blender.</p>

"<p>I'd agree with you.  There isn't a brew happening because the solution was already created.  What you are performing is a rehydration.  However, ""let me rehydrate some coffee"" is a pretty awkward turn off phrase.</p>

"<p>Recently I've had some amazingly bad coffee in local cafes, and this week I had the same experience with some ground coffee I bought.  I used a french press for that.  Watery, dark colour, bitter and hardly any coffee taste. Just to be sure I packed a moka express well and the result was awful, very dark and very bitter.</p>

<p>OK, I know I should be using better materials etc., but bear with me.  This reminded me, not in a nice way, of long past attempts to get a second brew from filter coffee.</p>

<p>So is this just very poor quality raw materials roasted beyond the limit, or has the industry started to do something like extracting flavour for those capsules you see around and then roasting the heck out of the remaining grounds and selling them?  Maybe this sounds a bit far fetched, but the food industry has form.</p>
"
"<p>The question is; are you going to compare a coffeehouse's newly roasted bean, perfectly ground, and freshly brewed experience, to an old previously ground product sold in stores which can't help but be anything less than disgusting?
It's time to take your coffee expectations to the next level...find a local roaster, use beans within a couple weeks of roasting, purchase a burr grinder, and brew your freshly ground coffee within 30 minutes of grinding. Oh, and use filtered water. BAM!</p>
"
"<p>It does seem a bit far fetched.  Those capsules are dehydrated coffee, not extracted flavor.  They are usually not much better than the bad experiences you are describing.</p>

<p>You can pretty much expect that if you are buying ground coffee, it's going to be some degree of stale.  Coffee begins to stale minutes after being ground so it's rarely a wise idea to purchase ground coffee that has been sitting on a shelf an indeterminate amount of time. </p>

<p>As for the poor coffee from local shops, many <a href=""http://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/1843/why-do-most-coffee-shops-use-such-dark-roast"">commercial roasting companies use a very dark roast</a> to ensure homogeneity of their product.  Then the beans are stored generally much longer than one would want.</p>

<p>The easiest way to assure a consistently good cup of coffee is to roast at home with quality beans (so you always know you have fresh coffee) and brew at home as well so you can control the variables that lead to a cup done how you like it.</p>

"<p>I just received a new Baratza Virtuoso - the first automatic coffee grinder I've ever owned. Every single review I've read said it's exceptional grinder, and produces very few fines, which I understand are detrimental to the quality of the coffee brewed. I was thus hoping I'd get a more consistent grind quality than my Hario hand mill. Unfortunately, the grind consistency appears to be slightly worse, and I think I can see lot of fines and variance in grind size.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I'm new to this, so it could be that I have unrealistic expectations from a $229 grinder. My question is: is my Baratza Virtuouso defective, or is the grind of the quality normally expected from this grinder?</p>

<p>Here is a photo of some grinds at setting 14 (I intend to use this setting for drip coffee). (The photo is high enough resolution to be zoomed quite a bit.) The photo shows what seems to me to be inconsistent grind sizes, and many fines.</p>

"<p>It would depend on a number or factors including temperature of the warmer and humidity in the room.  However, personally, I can begin to taste a difference after as little as 45 minutes on the warmer.  I tend to drink two cups of coffee pretty quickly to avoid this.  </p>

<p>Coffee is a product always best fresh, but how long before your palate can detect that it isn't fresh any longer is a matter that varies by individual.  My wife will drink coffee from a pot that has been sitting for four hours plus; after about an hour and a half I'll throw the pot away and make another.  Your own mileage may vary.</p>

"<h2>The Problem with Consumer Burr grinders</h2>

<p>Burr grinders (that aren't of a very high or industrial quality) generally do not produce even grinds. I usually recommend a spinning blade grinder to the home barista for this reason.</p>

<h2>Evaluating Your Grinds</h2>

<p>You indicated that you will be using a drip machine with a paper filter. In my opinion, based on what I can see in the picture where the machine has been broken in, <strong><em>I</em> think that these grinds are fine for a paper filter drip machine.</strong> There are a decent number of fine grinds, but I think it's alright for your purposes. If you plan to use another type of machine though, it may not be.</p>

<p>If you were using an espresso machine or a french press, you would have problems here (which I will not get into here). This might even be true for a permanent filter drip machine.</p>

<h2>My Assessment</h2>

<p>If you know that you are only going to use this for paper filter drip coffee, keep it. It seems to be pretty good for this purpose.</p>

<p>If you ever want to branch out into espresso or french press coffee, I recommend returning it and getting a better one.</p>

<h2>Final Notes</h2>

<p>Remember it all comes down to you and taste. If you are satisfied with the taste of the coffee, then be happy with your grinder. If you aren't, or want to get as close to perfection as possible, then consider something else.</p>

"<p>Breakfast or morning blends are generally a lighter roast, but there is no industry standard for how light of a roast.</p>

<p>Edit:
There are some differences in caffeine levels, but a lot of contradictory information out there. I found a great explanation of why the caffeine levels can differ between roasts <a href=""https://www.kickinghorsecoffee.com/en/blog/caffeine-myths-dark-vs-light"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>, but let me summarize from the post:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you measure your coffee by scoops, light roasted coffee will have more caffeine. Since the beans are denser than a darker roast. However if you weigh out your scoops, darker roasts will have more caffeine, because there is less mass.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>@ChrisAK is correct, the roasting process does not burn or destroy caffeine, but the level of roast will impact the weight of each bean.</p>

"<p>I used to really like the flavored coffee Highlander Grogg, but now all I can taste is the artificial aftertaste.  Is there a non-artificial additive that I can add to a different variety of coffee to make it taste like Highlander Grogg?</p>

<p>I think it's the butterscotch flavor that distinguishes Highlander Grogg, but I don't know what the history of the flavor is. If it's as Scottish as the name implies, I'm guessing it's got some deep rich history.</p>

"<p>For certain high-intensity flavours, often people use <em>extracts</em> (think stuff like ""vanilla extract"") or <em>essential oils</em> (i.e., oils that are the ""essence"" (or are infused with same) of a given plant or something). This allows you to use a very small amount of the flavouring substance in something like coffee or confectionery or so.</p>

<p>However, certain extracts or might just be artificial themselves, and give you that same ""off"" after-taste. This might be what's in your bag of beans/grounds and why you're in this predicament in the first place. The ingredient label might have some hints but is probably not helpful (""natural and/or artificial flavourings"" perhaps).

"<p>It seems like a fairly basic question, but there's probably some more science to this. <strong>For an automatic-drip coffee machine, how much ground coffee should be used per unit water?</strong></p>

<p>Various sources say that the ""industry standard"" is 7g (~1 rounded Tbsp) per ""cup"" (150-175mL, or 5-6 fl.oz.). Is this uniform for any (reasonable) amount of coffee (say, 200mL-4L / 1 cup to 16 cups)? Or would I want, say, a higher ratio of grounds-to-coffee for making 2 cups, than for making 12 cups? I feel like I, personally, tend to use <em>more coffee</em> (per unit water) when making <em>fewer cups</em> (I'm not sure why; shorter extraction time? Matters of water retention? Mere personal preference?). </p>

<p>Surely this also depends on total extraction time and grind level, but perhaps that is a separate question. With due credit, this question was partly spurred from <a href=""http://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/1894/optimizing-the-office-pot"">this recent question</a>.</p>

"<p>Three quick and easy hacks you can do without throwing capitol at the issue:</p>

<ol>
<li>Shoot a dud pot first thing in the morning.  By brewing a coffeeless pot and throwing away the water, you will empty the the Bunn's hot bladder.  Think of it as a morning tinkle for the CWTF15-APS to git rid of the rank overnight water fouling your morning joe. </li>
<li>Use an extra filter. Substandard inputs are signiflatulanceficantly improved by an additional filter.</li>
<li>Scrape the the cheeto and donut leavin's off of the lip of your coffee cup once in a while.  The ""seasoned"" coffee cup is a myth as proven in a blind taste test where we forced coworkers to drink coffee from a randomly selected sampling of well seasoned and clean coffee mugs.  There was a little bit of a flatulence effect with seasoned mugs in that a subset of coworkers ""liked their own brand"" in testing, but the overwhelming data suggest that dirty mugs are just gross. </li>
</ol>
"
"<p>I think you have already listed the ""industry standard"" that is the answer to your question.  It is a good starting point for anyone and the amount can be adjusted by taste afterwards (more grounds for stronger coffee, less for weaker).</p>

<p>The amount may vary with brewing method of course, since depending on the method, brew components (grounds, filter, other components) may retain various levels of water. </p>

<p>The one add on I will stipulate is that it is always better (for groups) to brew coffee that is too strong.  It is very easy to add some hot water to a cup and weaken a cup of coffee,  however, if you like strong coffee and it's been brewed weak, you are just out of luck.</p>
"
"<p>My first thought would be <em>stale coffee</em> rather than commercial conspiracy but, assuming you live in North America, I don't blame you for that.  The time since roasting is important and, compounding on that, the time since grinding, thence finally how you brew it.</p>

<p>So your questions should be:</p>

<ol>
<li>What did I do different in the way I brewed this time?</li>
<li>How long since this coffee was roasted?</li>
<li>How long since this coffee was ground?</li>
</ol>

<p>Don't be afraid to ask the source when it was ground, and when it was roasted.  Time from roasting to now should be measured in days (not weeks), and time from grinding to now should be hours, minutes, or even seconds!</p>

<p>Even if the attendant cannot answer you it illustrates the fact that they don't know and you do care. Thence maybe one day you'll find a source where the attendant both knows and cares, so shop around.</p>

<p>Finally, there are different beans, different roasts, and different tastes. So, once all of the above is attended to, you may still, quite reasonably, conclude that the taste of that particular roasted bean is not for you. Again, exercise your options: go elsewhere, roast your own, etc.  </p>

<p>Welcome to the endless search for something better.</p>
"
"<p>I'd say <code>yes</code>...</p>

<p>I would not categorically claim that a steady flow will give you a <em>better</em> shot, rather I'd say it gives you a more <em>consistent</em> shot; and consistency is highly desirable—if you can reproduce a shot consistently, then you can incrementally improve on it by tweaking one variable at a time.</p>

<p>Water pressure is a key variable in extracting the oils from the coffee, so if that variable is moving around during the extraction of a shot then you're going to get an inconsistent shot—it would be like mixing weak and strong shots and stirring them together.</p>

<p>If the flow rate is fluctuating then—I can't think what else it could be—unstable water pressure is the cause. Water pressure fluctuations could be the result of:</p>

<ul>
<li>the water pump is failing</li>
<li>the water supply is restricted</li>
<li>the (dry) puck is soaking (at the start of a shot the dry beans absorb moisture like a sponge so you won't see anything come out at first)</li>
<li>the (wet) puck is channelling (water has found a path through the puck with less resistance and—like a hole in a dam wall—is rushing through it)</li>
</ul>

<p>A variable rate of flow could get interesting if you have it under control and are experimenting with extraction techniques.  You might try to slow it down toward the end of the shot in order to get more oils out, but I think this just makes it bitter because you're actually reducing the pressure—so it is self-defeating.  Unless you have engineered a device which can detach pressure from flow rate... but now I'm dreaming... something like a camera shutter mechanism?</p>

"<p>Put a tiny pinch of kosher salt in with the grinds. It won't make the coffee salty, but it will help you squeeze every bit of flavor those pre-packaged grinds still have to give. Works best with darker roasts, look for a slight improvement, not a miracle :)</p>

<p>Also, Go with an extra tablespoon or two of coffee. As <a href=""http://coffee.stackexchange.com/a/1904/101"">Chris In AK mentions</a> - it's easy to add water to strong coffee to weaken it a bit, but you can't do much with weak coffee if you like it stronger. Though, if you do this, there should be some means of obtaining clean hot water close to where people get their fill. </p>
"
"<p>From the looks of the grinds, you were working with a blonde (lighter) roast, which is the <em>ideal</em> case for consistent grinds. Darker roasts are more prone to grinding unevenly on coarser settings (they're more brittle). I'd be more forgiving if that was the case, but it's not. It's conceivable that something was wrong with the grinder you purchased. It's normal to see some, but I don't think that many.</p>

<p>I suspect, if you remove the burr for cleaning / inspection, you'd see one or more knicks or small dents in one of the edges. They should be smooth and sharp, not jagged at all, or inconsistency becomes a big problem.</p>

<p>In my experience, burr grinders have a harder time with consistency in coarser grinds in general. The only one I've found that does it pretty consistently is the <a href=""http://www.brevilleusa.com/the-smart-grinder.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Breville Smart Grinder</a>, which runs about $200. It's not <em>perfect</em>, but there aren't too many fines in the bottom of my cup when I brew a press, and it's also not the most expensive grinder I've tried. </p>

<p>If you really want no fines in your cup, you'd probably be better off going with an Aeropress - burr grinders that cost a thousand dollars or more will produce fines, especially with darker roasts. But if you're going with a grinder in that range, you're probably more interested in programmed auto-tamping for consistent shot extraction than anything. </p>

<p>I don't particularly care for blade grinders because it's hard to produce the same grind twice with them (issues of heat and such aside) until you really get to know them. After that and a mantra of <em>""pulse pulse two-Mississippi pulse pulse""</em> they can produce a relatively consistent coarse grind.</p>
"
"<p>It's going to produce a stronger brew and probably more oils, likely resulting in more crema.</p>

<p>What you're essentially doing is heating the grinds, starting the extraction process a bit and then giving a <em>small</em> amount of hot water about 30 seconds to cool before adding more - very similar to what pre-infusing a puck in an espresso machine would accomplish.</p>

<p>Does it matter? It could conceivably affect taste, so yes. The extent that it might affect the flavor of the coffee would vary quite a bit depending on the beans, water and ground - but it will produce a difference in taste you can probably measure just by sampling in all but very dark roasts.</p>

<p>For gas levels - you would have to pour very carefully to avoid air bubbles as much as possible and observe, and I'm not even sure you could detect it.</p>
"
"<p>I've heard that the mineral content in water assists in the distribution of the particulate that's extracted when brewing coffee. While I've not used distilled water, I have used reverse osmosis water (I live in an area with very hard water). I tend to prefer using the reverse osmosis water to the tap water. I don't particularly care for the taste of distilled water on its own, which is why I have avoided using it in coffee.</p>
"
"<p>I do like my cold brewed coffee but it's difficult and inconvenient for me to make and keep in work due to the time it takes to steep, shared fridge space, etc. </p>

<p>I came across <a href=""http://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/06/10/ristretto-on-the-rocks/?_r=0"">this method</a> recently...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The iced method isn’t complicated. Basically, you prepare brewed coffee as you normally would, only you use half hot water, half ice you put in the bottom of the vessel. The hot, fresh coffee drips directly onto ice so that it’s cool and ready to drink right away.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I've now tried it a few times using my small chemex and a ratio of 2:1 (water to ice) rather than 50:50. I'm trying the pour over much more slowly than I normally would to maximise the extraction while using less water.</p>

<p>I can't really fault the taste, the flavour is still great, the finish is less acidic but obviously more watery. So while this method is indeed quick and uncomplicated I'm curious about 2 things:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>What else can I do to compensate for the extraction difference? I would really prefer it to be less watery.</p></li>
<li><p>Am I potentially going to crack the pot with the combination of hot and cold? I can't find any info on temperature variances on the Chemex site. </p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Edited to add information...</strong></p>

<p>For a hot-brew I normally use  using 300ml hot water for 21g of grind. Here I'm using 200ml hot water in the pour over, to compensate for the 100g of ice that melts. </p>

<p>I'm taking 6-7 minutes with the pour. Normally I would take 3 minutes.</p>

<p>I'm making my grind slightly finer in order to extend time it takes the water to drip through. I would consider it to be medium-fine. </p>
"
"<p>I recently vacuum packed 1 kg of coffee beans that were about to expire into 100 g portions.</p>

<p>I would like to know how they will be affected by the freezing and how long they will last in the freezer.</p>
"
"<p>Freezing will not affect the coffee beans chemically. Thawing may affect them though.</p>

<p>When you thaw the beans, small amounts of water (that were frozen as small amounts of air humidity) will melt and it may collect together and cause some very small extractions in the bean. This is probably quite minimal due to the fact that you have vacuum packed the beans though. This is generally undesirable but it is up to you whether or not you want to do this.</p>

<p>If you do indeed freeze them, make sure that you let them thaw completely before opening the package. Do not open the package until they are back to room temperature. This is so that the humidity can stabilize inside. If you open the package earlier, moisture from the air may condense onto the beans, causing a small amount of extraction. </p>

<p>In terms of how long they will last in the freezer? I am unsure of this as I have never frozen my beans as it is not recommended.</p>

"<p>What you're talking about is the ""Japanese iced coffee"" method, which is hot-water brew directly over ice. In contrast, cold-brew is using cold water in contact with the grounds. See techniques at other questions tagged as <a href=""/questions/tagged/cold-brew"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;cold-brew&#39;"" rel=""tag"">cold-brew</a>.</p>

<p><a href=""https://counterculturecoffee.com/learn/iced-coffee"" rel=""nofollow"">This article from Counter Culture</a>, also referenced in the article you linked, suggest Japanese iced as an <em>alternative</em> to cold brew. The articles suggest that directly brewing hot coffee over ice retains more of the volatile flavour compounds.</p>

<p>If you have had true cold-brew before, most methods use <em>several times</em> as much coffee grounds to brew as with other methods (some then dilute this with, e.g., water or milk). For example, normalized to a 200mL ""cup"" (~6.5 fl.oz.) of brewed coffee: Blue Bottle suggests about 3x more coffee for <a href=""https://bluebottlecoffee.com/preparation-guides/cold-brew"" rel=""nofollow"">cold brew</a> (45g per 200mL) than for <a href=""https://bluebottlecoffee.com/preparation-guides/drip"" rel=""nofollow"">drip</a> (14g per 200mL). If you're coming from that strength, it's no wonder you're finding it watery. </p>

<p>To your first question: If you want a stronger brew, why not <strong>simply use more coffee grounds</strong>? Your amount (21g grounds to 300g water+ice is about 14g/200mL cup) is already at the higher end of the spectrum for drip coffee; the industry standard is closer to 7g per cup/dose. But if you want it stronger, use more beans!</p>

<p>On your other question: <strong>this temperature change shouldn't be an issue.</strong> You said you're using a Chemex (e.g., <a href=""http://www.chemexcoffeemaker.com/three-cup-classic-series-coffeemaker.html"" rel=""nofollow"">classic 3-cup</a>) -- it is made from Pyrex brand <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borosilicate_glass"" rel=""nofollow"">borosilicate glass</a>, which has very good thermal shock properties. Even a lesser glass (e.g., non-tempered <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soda-lime_glass"" rel=""nofollow"">soda-lime glass</a>) shouldn't be a problem at these temperatures (slowly dripping boiling water onto ice). (However, for example, ice into glass at oven temperatures could <em>certainly</em> be a problem).</p>

"<p>I have a Pasquini Livia 90 and a Baratza Vario Ceramic grinder. </p>

<p>I'm finding that the only way to tame my extraction speed is by over dosing the basket. Specifically, by loading the basket so heavily that it pushes up against the shower screen. </p>

<p>If I use a double shot basket, I have to load 21+ grams to get the extraction down to a brew ratio of 2:3. Basically, I have to get it to the point where I'm struggling to insert the portafilter, otherwise the extraction speed is just incredibly fast. At the recommended starting point for the Vario grinder for espresso, (2Q), it takes about 7 seconds for an extraction using 16 grams of coffee in a double basket.</p>

<p>If I stick to the recommended doses, and give the coffee some headroom from the shower screen, I end up having to use the finest possible setting (1A - 1E) on my grinder to 'slow the flow'. This results in extremely overextracted tasting coffee, which makes sense because the grind is like powdered sugar at that point.</p>

<p>What am I missing here?</p>
"
"<p>When I hear ""cold brew"" I think something like Dutch Coffee, or coffee brewed with cold water and long extraction times. Acidity likely wouldn't be reduced by cooling the coffee directly after, it's possible that the melted ice is just diluting your brew and cooler temperature mellows out the taste of the acidity.</p>

<p>There are many ways of cold brewing. Some involve full immersion for a long extraction time, like Toddy. Others slowly drip cold water or ice melt into grounds using a <a href=""https://prima-coffee.com/equipment/yama/cdm-8"" rel=""nofollow"">drip tower</a>. The second method is often prefered and offers the most balanced extraction. However, I've had Toddy before and it does alright. Toddy might be the less expensive method, but for a plastic bin and some big paper filters I feel like a drip tower is better worth the money if you can find one for a reasonable price. You can find some drip tower/dutch coffee makers on ebay in the $90 range.</p>

<p>As far as I'm concerned, however, you are not cold brewing. You're just making iced coffee. I do something similar with an Aeropress. The Aeropress I would prefer for iced coffee, as it brews a concentrate. I've noticed little difference in acidity, it may seem more mild simply because it's cold and acids tend to mellow out at cooler temperatures, but once ingested its all the same(hot or cold) if you're trying to ward of acid reflux or similar. Cold brewing would actually make the coffee less acidic, rather than just mellowing out the taste of acidity.</p>

<p>If you're interested in trying the Aeropress method, I'd highly recommend it if you enjoy iced coffee. You press the aeropress directly over ice, and it melts the ice to form a perfect ratio of concentrate and water. Whereas most other methods are either diluted, or take time to cool. This method produces iced coffee in the same amount of time it takes to make a hot cup of coffee with the Aeropress(1-5min), without diluting the coffee. It accomplishes basically what you're intending to do, but with the aeropress rather than the chemex. This method will take less time, produce a stronger cup, and is a bit cheaper(the aeropress is pretty cheap). You can brew a cup when you want it, rather than prepping coffee ahead of time.</p>

"<p>Best practice is to keep coffee warm through insulation. If you have a decent thremos it'll keep coffee warm for a very long time. I had a thermos which could keep the contents above 170F for almost 4 hours.</p>
"
"<p>I believe there is mysticism to blooming. Don't get me wrong, I feel its important, but I don't think it does all the things that people claim it does. Blooming is important when using fresh roasted beans(and you should be). Blooming simply aids in removing CO2 from the grounds, which would otherwise create negative space between your grounds and the water. It's simply used to provide a more even extraction. Blooming is important in any immersion brewing, and can even aid in pour-over methods as well.</p>

<p>You should also reduce your brew time slightly to compensate for the extraction that takes place during the bloom. I'd typically bloom for 30 seconds, then push the bloom down gently without agitation(agitation effect solubility).</p>

<p>I think its a dubious claim to state that the bloom does anything beyond removing the CO2, thus providing a more even extraction. It would really depend on how you perform your bloom. Do you bloom then start your timer? Do you bloom with a small amount of water first, then add more to prevent too much extraction during the bloom? Ultimately these differences in taste don't have anything to do with the bloom itself, but more so the extraction time brought on by how you perform your bloom.</p>

<p>The bloom itself does not effect taste, and it is an important part of using a french press, as its key to providing even extraction.</p>

"<p>I think I know what you are talking about, the question is if a steam brewer can burn the ground during brewing due to the higher temperature vs. a pump operated brewer here is a <a href=""http://www.brewplus.com/general/how-do-steam-and-pump-espresso-machines-differ/"" rel=""nofollow"">link</a> that might help</p>

"<p>From what I can tell, you're grind is rather coarse for a pour-over. You should have a grind the size of kosher salt for most drippers. Perhaps its personal taste, and I cannot argue that. However, it's typically recommended you start with this grind size and adjust to your preference. As far as my own experience both working as a barista for a few years, and being a over all enthusiast, most grinders don't provide consistent grinds at a coarser settings.</p>

<p>People are right in saying that most home appliance grinders won't produce very consistent grinds. This is partially true. Your typical consumer grade grinder uses a conical burr, and conical burrs work great for finer grinds. I've had 3 different conical grinders, and I've used commercial conical grinders in the past. They all seem to produce fairly inconsistent grinds for coarser settings. However, they work great in espresso machines, which are generally grinding to a very fine grind. When using flat burr grinders I notice a much better consistency in grind at coarser settings. Many will say that the larger the burr and the slower the grind the better consistency you will have. However, I've never experimented with this myself, but I will say that flat burr grinders produce much better coarser grinds than conical burrs.</p>

<p>An example of a flat burr grinder is one that you would see at a grocery store or a coffee shop. They are generally very expensive, as they're generally fairly large and aimed at commercial use. That said the Baratza Virtuoso is a conical burr grinder, and it's probably good at what just about any conical burr grinder is good at, medium to fine grinds. I will say that one drawback with flat burr grinders is that they're very slow and create massive amounts of heat on fine grinds(espresso/turkish).</p>

<p>I'd say a conical burr is good for anything near the coarseness of salt and finer, anything beyond that would be best ground in a flat burr grinder. As far as a flat burr grinder, I feel its the size that matters. You'll want a larger disc for more consistency. Its my assumption that with a larger disc a slower speed will grind the coffee slower and more evenly, causing less of the grounds to crack and mash into finer particles while grinding.</p>

<p>Most of this is based off of my own observations, there are a few forums which concur with this, but in general there's not much else to support these claims. Maybe the flat burr grinders I used were simply higher quality than most of the conical burr grinders I've used.</p>

<p>My recommendation would be to try a finer grind and see if you get better consistency then.</p>

<p>As far as a blade grinder goes, I'd say absolutely not. I doubt that a blade grinder would ever be more consistent than what you currently have. You can use a blade grinder 100 times and never come out with the same grind size, where as with a cheap burr grinder you'll alway have the same grind even if its not consistent. Even as far as consistency goes, a blade grinder won't achieve this either. I might(maybe..) recommend a blade grinder if you had an auto-dripper, where it wouldn't matter so much.</p>

<p>Try a finer grind, and let me know if the consistency gets any better.</p>

"<p>I like everything about the AeroPress; however, I noticed that I exhibited symptoms which I usually only have when I've consumed too much caffeine. </p>

"<p>In my eternal quest to make a decent cup of coffee at my parents' house, with an induction stove and moka, I recently discovered an interesting problem.</p>

<p>Having found a good heat setting for the hob (that doesn't superheat the water instantly and boil it dry in ~20 seconds), I found that the hob attempts to maintain thermostatis by cycling the power on and off. This may work fine for a large pot of boiling water, but for the moka pot this means I get a few seconds of extraction, followed by a few seconds of water <em>being sucked back down the wrong way</em> as the pressure decreases, then forwards, then back, etc.</p>

<p>Is there any way of overcoming this? Is it even likely to cause a problem with the extraction?</p>
"
"<p>Aeropress coffee (hearby called Aerpresso in this post) is more concentrated than regular drip coffee.  However, if you are using similar amounts of grounds as you would in a drip machine, you shouldn't notice any difference.  Caffeine is highly soluble in hot water and most any extraction method utilizing hot water will result in nearly full extraction of caffeine from grounds.</p>

<p>Aerpresso ends up somewhere in caffeine concentration between espresso (very concentrated) and drip coffee (less concentrated).  However, the total amount of caffeine is dependent more on the amount of grounds used that the extraction method (with the above listed methods). </p>

<p>So the the final answer is no.  There isn't more caffeine, but the Aerpresso is more concentrated.</p>

"<p>On friday nights I like to get some treats for my wife, it usually amounts to cheese and coffee.  But these are fairly different flavors.  I know there are lots of wine and cheese combos, but are there any cheese and coffee combo's that particularly complement one another.</p>

<p>Are there any dunkable cheeses?</p>
"
"<p>I've never heard of cheese and coffee pairings, but I've had coffee that has very wine like qualities. Personally this sounds like it would amount to gut rot, however if you try some lighter roasts or preferably profile roasted beans from areas in Kenya, Ethiopia, Rwanda, they tend to have very wine like qualities. Single origin, profile roasted beans typically have very renounced flavors, and profile roasting typically roasts the bean lighter preserving the tannicy, floral, and somewhat wine like qualities in the bean.</p>

<p>It might be prefered to eat the cheese with a cold coffee. If you cold brew coffee it tends to bring out the wine like qualities more so than hot brewing. A common method for this is often called ""dutch coffee"", where cold/iced water slowly drips over grounds into a vessel over a long period of time.</p>

<p>As far as dunking the cheese in the coffee. I'm not so sure about this. I mean there are a lot of cheese out there. As far as anything salty with coffee, I generally think the tastes conflict. Personally I don't dunk anything in my coffee, and when it comes to wine &amp; cheese tasting you don't dunk the cheese in the wine. Perhaps a light cheese that isn't salty would work well dipped in coffee. I'm thinking somewhere along the lines of a soft cheese, but a soft cheese itself wouldn't be easily dunked into coffee. You could try spreading Mascarpone on a biscotti and dipping that. Even a porous cheese is unlikely to absorb and carry the taste of coffee.</p>

<p>Cheese and coffee aren't exactly a pair made in heaven, but I can see it working much like you said, like wine and cheese. However dunking the cheese in the coffee gives me a bad taste in my mouth. Like I said there are some soft cheeses(usually those used in desserts) that I could imagine being dunked in coffee in some manner, but this is more like a dessert with coffee, which makes me think of a traditional italian 4 course meal which usually ends with the ""dolce"" or dessert which is often accompanied by espresso. Italy typically also uses soft cheeses in their desserts. Tiramisu, which is very well known, is actually a combination of cheese and coffee. However, like I stated the food and the coffee typically remain separate, unless the coffee is an ingredient in the food.</p>

<p>I think what you're trying to do is interesting, but I'd avoid making your wife a test subject. I'd recommend keeping the coffee and cheese separate. However, they can absolutely be consumed in the same sitting, but I don't imagine the actual tastes meld together well in the same mouthful. If she wants something to dip in her coffee, biscotti is a common choice, and if she wants cheese, try spreading some mascarpone on it. You can have fun with different biscotti variants and fold things like chocolate, fruits, etc into the mascarpone.</p>

<p>I come from the renowned cheese state Wisconsin, and I've been a long time coffee enthusiast. This title definitely struck interest.</p>

"<p>As far as my experience with Moka pots, I don't have them on the stove for long. Something that I got in that habit of doing when using moka pots is to boil the water before I put it in the Moka pot, then introducing it to heat, then removing shortly after it starts to percolate. Stumptown illustrates a similar method.</p>

<p>As for the induction stove cycling to maintain a steady temp, if you set the temperature over boiling(212F, but may differ by altitude) it likely won't cycle. This is because water will not exceed boiling point, under most circumstances, in a liquid state. For instance water is often used to prevent things from burning, because it keeps the temperature below the boiling temperature until all the water is evaporated. So if you set the induction stove to above the water's boiling point it will likely not exceed that temperature. It might take a bit to find a sweet spot. Though I'm not sure, I have never used an induction stove with a moka pot.</p>

<h3>UPDATE:</h3>

<p>Something I had not considered is the boiling point increases with pressure. So it might be worth turning the heat up quite a bit beyond 212F/100C. Its pretty difficult to burn water. Then again if you're using an induction stove to avoid heat pollution on the moka pot, then you can just use a traditional stove with the method I described and avoid the need to use an induction stove.</p>

"<p>Lots of questions! Starting from the top...</p>

<p><strong>Taste?</strong> Coffee cherries are mild in flavour and slightly sweet. The flavour is somewhat reminiscent of other red fruits, like a mild mix of fruits like raspberry, red mulberry, currant, cranberry, cherry, raisin. I've only had them dried, so they have a little bit of a ""dried fruit"" taste (e.g., as raisins are to grapes). To me, they also have a little bit of a mild taste of tobacco leaf. When steeped in water to make a drink called <a href=""http://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/451/yemenite-tea-like-coffee""><em>cascara</em> (see this question/answers)</a>. The beverage tastes to me a bit like rooibos (red bush tisane). Some coffee shops sell the beverage.</p>

<p><strong>Shipping?</strong> I've only seen <em>dried</em> coffee cherries for sale. Perhaps ""fresh"" coffee fruits are available in the coffee belt, but the seeds (i.e., coffee beans) are so valuable that I think the whole fruit doesn't make it very far outside of production regions.</p>

<p><strong>Availability?</strong> Various specialty retailers sell the dried fruit pulp and skins (some call them the ""husks"") -- here's <a href=""http://www.vervecoffeeroasters.com/products/cascara-coffee-cherry-tea"">one example from Verve</a>. Searching for coffee berries, cherries, husks, or for beverages like <em>cascara</em> or <em>qishr</em> may reveal more outlets.</p>

<p><strong>Other preservation?</strong> Coffee skins/pulp dry well. Rehydrating is possible but underwhelming. I have tried to make a kind of marmalade out of them; see <a href=""http://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/1508/what-variety-of-coffee-berries-are-good-for-jam"">this seminal question</a>, and also <a href=""http://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/54942/how-should-i-make-jam-out-of-coffee-cherries-or-coffee-cherry-husks"">a follow-up question of mine at Seasoned Advice</a>. I'm sorry to report that I have not had much success yet. The dried cherries are tough, so not pleasant to eat outright.</p>

<p>Good ideas! I really like the stuff, and am always happy to find others, and would be happy to hear more ideas about how to eat and drink coffee cherries.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> For completeness, here's a picture of dried coffee cherry pulp/skins that I use to make <em>cascara</em>.

"<p>When you're starting your shift at your coffee shop and take over the bar from another barista, the machine and grinder can be in varying states of cleanliness and calibration. How do you quickly and correctly get back to pulling good shots from clean equipment?</p>
"
"<p>This answer addresses a ""standard"" semi-automatic espresso machine with a separate grinder. Specifically the LaMarzocco and Astoria grinder, but the ideas should generalize to other machines of the same class.</p>

<h2>Cleaning</h2>

<p>Of course, wipe down everything and get all pitchers and spoons clean. Blast out all the milk and ""wetness"" from the steam wands. Inspect and clean all portafilters* (get one clean, and then use it while you clean the others), and if necessary backflush the groups with water (with ""bumping"" so you blast water around the seals to get any buildup there clean).</p>

<p>*especially <em>under</em> the basket.</p>

<h2>Calibrating</h2>

<p>The abstract procedure here is described using the Hackers' terms <a href=""https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/frob"" rel=""nofollow"">Frob, Twiddle, and Tweak</a>. </p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/6v8sh.png"" alt=""frob quote from Hackers&#39; Dictionary""><br>
<a href=""http://catb.org/esr/jargon/html/F/frob.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://catb.org/esr/jargon/html/F/frob.html</a></p>

<p>To fully calibrate the setup, we'll need to make three passes over all the controls. </p>

<ol>
<li>Frob. In the <em>frob</em> pass, we make just ""coarse"" adjustments to get everything roughly correct. (reinterpreting the hacker usage. This isn't <em>aimless</em>.) </li>
<li>Twiddle. In the <em>twiddle</em> pass, we adjust each parameter up and down a little, in a more ""scientific"" manner: while adjusting any one parameter, the rest are left alone so they behave as ""controls"" for the quick little ""experiments"" to check each change.  </li>
<li>Tweak. In the <em>tweak</em> pass, everything should be mostly correct by now. Just apply any finishing touches.</li>
</ol>

<p>The controls we have available are the <strong>grind</strong>, <strong>dose</strong>, and <strong>water quantity</strong>. Following the David Schomer method, I strongly advise that the tamping pressure should be <em>constant</em>. Always tamp the same way: from the elbow, so you don't stress your wrists.</p>

<p>In the David Schomer method, the dose is controlled by counting ""clicks"" of the doser. You keep the doser compartment as empty as possible, grinding only what you need so everything stays fresh, locked in the bean). Count how many clicks gets you to ""full"", maybe a little heaping. This number is your <em>base</em> dose. Keep it constant for now. And this constitutes the ""frob"" of the dose.</p>

<p>Set the group in programming mode and Pull a shot, setting the water level to yield 2 oz. This is the ""frob"" of the water quantity.</p>

<p>If the extraction time was long, adjust the grind. This the ""frob"" of the grind, so you can make bigger movements if you need to (exercise your judgement), but remember only adjust finer while grinding, so you don't lock the burrs on a tough bean. </p>

<p>So, we've done our ""frob"" pass. Now ""twiddle."" Adjusting the grind to control the extraction time probably threw off the water quantity a little bit. So do a ""twiddle"" of the water quantity by entering programming mode and pulling a shot. Actually, you shouldn't need to ""twiddle"" per se: there's no *up and down"" here, but I think the terms still represent a useful mnemonic for the general procedure.</p>

<p>Then do a ""twiddle"" of the grind. You want the grind to be as coarse as possible within its ""range"", if you know what I mean. All the grounds in the doser are quickly going stale. A coarser grind yields little pieces of coffee bean that are slightly larger, with a lower surface/volume ratio. Lower surface area means less interaction with the air, and the grounds resist going stale a little better.</p>

<p>There should be no need to ""twiddle"" the dose at this point. We're adjusting the other controls so the dose remains at comfortable spot. </p>

<p>Now, one final pass to ""tweak"". Pull a shot, and examine its quality. Particularly look for the tell-tale white ""overextraction stain"" where the last drips struck the crema. You want to tweak the water quantity to stop <em>just before</em> the color changes. This tweak gives you ""ristretto-quality"" shots.</p>

<h2>Adjusting on-the-fly</h2>

<p>Remember that we did not mess with the dose much in the above steps. But the other parameters were setup so the dose is ""comfortable"". This lets us make small adjustments to the dose in order to ""ride the wave"" of the machine and keep all the shots in the time range. Remember not to brew shots while the boiler is cycling.</p>

<p>The same three adjustments, <strong>frob</strong>, <strong>twiddle</strong>, and <strong>tweak</strong>, apply also to dynamic adjustments. <strong>Frob</strong>, the <em>coarsest</em> control is the water quantity, which should no longer need adjusting at this point. <strong>Twiddle</strong>, the <em>medium-grain</em> control is the grind setting. Unless a freak thundershower rolls-in and totally changes the pressure and humidity of the atmosphere, you should only need to make small adjustments and only to recalibrate the dose to a comfortable level. <strong>Tweak</strong>, the <em>finest</em> control is the dose.</p>

<p>If a shot pulls 1-second too long, <strong>tweak</strong> your dose ever-so-slightly shorter. Either count 1-fewer click, or count your clicks just a hair faster.</p>

<p>If a shot pulls 1-second too short, <strong>tweak</strong> your dose ever-so-slightly longer. Either count 1 more click, or count your clicks just a hair slower.</p>

<p>If the dose gets too low (by visual inspection: exercise your judgement), <strong>twiddle</strong> the grind a little coarser so you can achieve the same <em>density</em> with more <em>mass</em>.</p>

<p>If the dose gets too high (exercise judgement), <strong>twiddle</strong> the grind a little finer so you can achieve the <em>density</em> with less <em>mass</em>. (Volume is constant.)</p>

<hr> 

<p>I actually haven't worked on this machine in almost 10 years. So this is all based on my memory of that one amazing day when I pulled 20sec (+/-1) shots for eight solid hours.</p>

<p>On a different day, I recalibrated after a thunderstorm started by pulling the grinder 8 clicks (!) coarser. And got it back to 20sec after 2 or 3 pairs.</p>

<p>That's how I know. But I learned this all from David Schomer's book.</p>

<p>--</p>

<h2>Appendix: The ""David Schomer"" method or ""ritual""</h2>

<p>This is what I remember from the amazing book, <em>Espresso Coffee: Professional techniques</em> by David Schomer. And hey Matt, I want my copy back!</p>

<h3>A. <strong>Preheat and Clean.</strong></h3>

<ol>
<li><p>Pull an ounce or so of water <em>through the old spent puck</em> to heat the group.</p></li>
<li><p>Yank the portafilter and knock the old puck into the compost bin.</p></li>
<li><p>Wipe the basket and run a splash of water through the group without the portafilter to rinse the upper screen. <em>(You can catch this water with the portafilter before wiping to rinse more of the grounds so your clean towel stays clean longer.)</em></p></li>
</ol>

<h3>B. <strong>Grind and Dose.</strong></h3>

<ol>
<li><p>Turn on grinder to start to fill the doser (which should be as empty as practical).</p></li>
<li><p>Immediately start pulling clicks of the doser until the basket is full, or <em>a little</em> heaping.</p></li>
<li><p>Turn off grinder.</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>C. <strong>Distribute and Tamp.</strong></h3>

<ol>
<li><p>With clean hands, distribute the grounds evenly with a finger (I use my ring finger, but whatever works).</p></li>
<li><p>Tamp lightly to shape the puck.</p></li>
<li><p>Tap the edge with the handle end of your nice aluminum tamper that you bought yourself and brought to work to help. This gets the little bit of coffee around the edge that the tamper missed.</p></li>
<li><p>Tamp firmly, from the elbow. About 30 pounds of pressure.</p></li>
<li><p>Reinsert the portafiler.</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>D. <strong>Brew.</strong></h3>

<ol>
<li><p>Click the button to start brewing. </p></li>
<li><p>Immediately discard the hot water from the shot glasses which is still there from step A.1.</p></li>
<li><p>Watch the pour and stop it early if you need to, to catch the <em>sweet spot</em>.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>And finally, I apologize for my excessive use of emphatic ""quotation marks"".</p>

"<p>This answer addresses a Super-Automatic machine with built-in automatic grinder/doser/tamper. Specifically the Starbucks Mastrena machine, but the ideas should generalize to other machines of the same class.</p>

<h2>TLDR;</h2>

<p>Pull the grind back XX clicks coarser (XX=5 small recalib., XX=10 big recalib., XX=20 emergency (piston/powder errors -- but call service on it, too)).</p>

<p>Keep pulling pairs until it settles down to running <em>consistent</em> shots (howsoever fast). Check for dry pucks in the drawer.</p>

<p>Take it back up. Repeat: (Pull 1 pair of shots, Turn 1 click finer). Stop turning finer at 16 or 17 and it will ride up to 18-23s.</p>

<h2>Rinsing</h2>

<p>You should always be rinsing. You are not done rinsing until the water runs clear.</p>

<p>The water you see is the water you were about to brew with. Don't brew with brown water!</p>

<h2>Cleaning</h2>

<p>If the machine is acting up, give it a cleaning cycle. If a coworker challenges you, ask them why they want to serve bad shots??! Or better, calmly explain that it's the obvious thing to do to get back on track. Unpredictable shots == unpredictable drink production times. </p>

<p>If you cannot take the machine down for a cycle (it's too busy at that moment), the following should help, but is no substitute. </p>

<p>Super-automatics that have run hot all morning and then sat relatively idle through midmorning and then run hot again for the after-lunch crowd have what I call the ""oatmeal bowl problem"". If you eat some oatmeal and don't rinse the bowl right away, what happens? You know what happens! It gets hard. It becomes a crust. The same thing happens inside the machine. You need to run a cleaning cycle. For reals, dog.</p>

<p>Extending the analogy, suppose your friend drops by to borrow that book and you've had three bowl of oatmeal already and you offer your friend a bowl... You <em>wash</em> the bowl first ... right?</p>

<h2>Calibrating.</h2>

<p>I'm assuming you don't have access to the real programming mode. So the controls here are very, very limited. You can adjust the grind, rinse, and pull shots with one of several programmed buttons. </p>

<p>Each programed button maintains a log of the parameters and measurements of the last few shots upon which it performs some simple statistical analysis to determine when to print ""adjust grind coarser"" or ""adjust grind finer"" on the screen. So, the machine only ""sees"" a problem when it becomes a big problem. And it's not designed to respond to (or even detect) ""too much inconsistency"". Conquently, always prefer the Log View which shows you the actual numbers to the standard view which only shows you the approximate extraction time averaged over the last several (about 5, I think) shots. On the Mastrena machine, switch to Log View by pressing the Up and Down buttons at the same time; switch back to normal view by pressing Cancel.</p>

<p>If the numbers are ""too inconsistent"" (exercise your judgment), then you really need to run a cleaning cycle before trying to calibrate.</p>

<p>Alright, to actually calibrate a programmed button on a clean machine, take the grind a few clicks <em>coarser</em> than you think it should be set. Coarser flakes will help to scrub the doser channels between the grinder and the brewing chamber. With a very fine grind, the heat and moisture from the nearby brewing chamber will contribute to <em>caking</em> in the doser. That gives you a non-linear response from grind-time-adjustment/extraction-time-result. And it is this which I believe is the cause of the usual ""death-spiral"" of a Super-Automatic before it needs servicing.</p>

<p>If it's acting <em>really bad</em>, you may need to go <em>more-than-a-few</em> clicks coarser. Following my own advice today took a lot longer than the official ""10 clicks coarser, pull 10 pairs, then adjust by pulling 3 pairs between each grind change"" that we currently follow (when I'm not around) probably would have done.</p>

<p>So, you've adjusted to a very coarse grind. Pull 3 or 4 (pairs of) shots, then start adjusting the grind finer 1 click at a time, then pull a shot. 1 click, 1 shot, 1 click, 1 shot. Then just follow house-rules for blackjack. Stand on 16 or 17. </p>

<p>It takes 2 or 3 pairs for a grind adjustment to take effect, depending upon the length of the doser channel in the particular kind of machine. So by the 1-click,1-shot cycle above, we have a 1 or 2 shot backlog of having adjusted finer. This will ride up to about 20sec shots if everything else is normal. So we stop adjusting when the shot times hit the bottom of the desired range.</p>

<h2>How to know if you've gone coarse enough</h2>

<p>The signs I've been looking for (which I kept not getting today) is a run of short shots at around 10sec that all look the same and leave the shot glasses mostly clear at the second rinse. I also look to see if its producing dry pucks in the drawer. If the puck explodes into mush, that's what we used to call a shot that <em>didn't ""catch""</em> on the old machines.</p>

<p>Run of short shots + clean at the second rinse + dry pucks == take it back up.</p>

<h2>Cross-Calibrating single-shot and double-shot programs at the same grind</h2>

<p>If you have single-shot and double-shot buttons which use the same grinder, then it's possible to have the singles pulling long with the doubles pulling short or any combination of good, bad, and ugly in between.</p>

<p>The procedure that seem to be working for me is to calibrate the longest program to be correct, and let the machine self-adjust the short program to compensate.</p>

<p>Always, always, always, calibrate from the <em>coarse</em> side of things. This keeps the doser and brewing chamber scrubbed and avoids caking which leads to unpredictable results.</p>

<h2>Adjusting on the fly</h2>

<p>I posted this idea some years ago in <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/mjoshua.ryan/posts/229630143825012"" rel=""nofollow"">facebook</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I've begun to notice a pattern in the shot times on the Mastrenas.
   The first pair from a run are short, because the brewing chamber is
   relatively cold. As the chamber heats, grinds begin to accumulate
   on the interior, increasing the effective dose (therefore proportion,
   therefore density), progressively pulling longer and muddier shots.</p>
  
  <p>So, aside from rinsing like fanatics as you all already ought to do.
   You can:
   Before the first shot, click it finer.
   About 2 pairs into the run, click it back coarser.
   4 or 5 pairs after that, click it one more coarser. This is your
   ""cruise"" setting.</p>
  
  <p>Larger flakes should act more like ""fiber"" and keep the chamber scrubbed. But you need to go finer at the start to compensate for lower temperature.</p>
  
  <p>If it's been a long time (>15 minutes), then your first pair are not only
   cold but <em>stale</em>. If it's your mom, don't serve her those shots.</p>
  
  <p>Unlike the Verismos (and the Astorias, too, for that matter), these 
   Mastrenas seem to have a very small doser so the effect of grind-change 
   is quite rapid. This first pair will be a blend of the old setting and the new. 
   The second pair is most or all fresh ground.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>[n.b This is not official Starbucks policy, but my own private theory developed over the past 10 years of working with this machine (and its predecessor the Verismo). Other Starbucks Baristas should follow this advice only if comfortable with having to explain what you're doing to the other Baristas (and Managers) who may be staring at you wondering what you think you're doing. ]</p>

"<p>I buy Buisman Royal Aroma Coffee enhancer from our local Dutch shop.  It halves the coffee grounds needed and makes the coffee taste stronger.  It is basically burnt sugar, as far as I understand.</p>

"
"<p>That site that you linked (from www.buismaningredients.com, and <a href=""http://www.dutchfoodinnovations.com/organisation/buisman-ingredients"" rel=""nofollow"">this one</a>) suggest that the main ingredient is caramelised sugar.

"<p>I hope this isn't a trade secret or anything, but at Starbucks we recently got new measuring pitchers for pour-overs that have a long narrow snake-like spout.

"<h2>The Grind</h2>

<p>The goal for grinding coffee is consistency of the grind, everything should be relatively the same size so it extracts evenly. In coffee grinding parlance, ""boulders"" is used to describe chunks and ""fines"" is used to describe microfine particles. When you introduce water (in any extraction method), the ""fines"" give up their flavor quickly, adding bitterness when overextracted, and the boulders hardly give up anything at all, leaving a thin and sour underextracted flavor. </p>

<p>A burr grinder with two mounted bearings (top and bottom) is the best tool for consistent grinding due to the absence of ""burr wobble"" seen in cheaper burr grinders.</p>

<h2>The Resulting Brew</h2>

<p>A sediment layer comes from the fines making their way through the metal screen on the press. Ideally, your goal should be zero fines for your French Press brew. A coffee hack you can do to get around this is to shake your freshly ground coarse coffee in a small metal sieve so the fines fall through. Do this over a container to easily weigh the amount of fines your grinder is producing. I have also seen natural static as a useful by-product of grinding that prevents fines from exiting the grinder.</p>
"
"<p>There are many espresso recommendations for an exact brew time of, lets say 28 seconds according to <a href=""http://coffee.stackexchange.com/a/203/976"">here</a>.</p>

<p>When pulling a shot of espresso, some machines use a low pressure ""pre-infusion"" feature to quickly bloom the puck before starting the brew cycle. Most coffee brewing techniques do not count this as brewing time since its a preliminary step before adding more water, however espresso is an art of careful attention to every small detail without any room for error.</p>

<p>Should the timer start as soon as water hits the puck, no matter the circumstances, or should pre-infusion be excluded from total brewing time?</p>
"
"<p>The term ""white coffee"" can be use to refer to any one of three separate beverages. It can be used to describe regular coffee that has had enough milk or cream added to turn the liquid a very light or white color</p>
"
"<p>There are two sides to the answer. First, there is the sugar aspect. In moderation, sugar is a critical part of our diet. If you are combining it with two doughnuts and two further teaspoons of sugar in the coffee (for example) then it could potentially lead to the same insulin cycle that causes weight gain in people who eat too much sugar.  The rapid intake of sugar causes your pancreas to flood your blood stream with insulin, which then drops your blood sugar lower than it should go. That causes cravings for more sugar.</p>

<p>The other side is how ""carmelized"" the sugar is. If it goes beyond a certain point, it's possible that the result could be carcinogenic, which is definitely bad.</p>

<p>My recommendation? Find a coffee that doesn't need ""enhanced"".</p>

"<p>I'm not sure what the citation standards for this site or if a ""hey this worked for me, why don't you try it applies"" so please downvote accordingly and point me to the correct meta articles.</p>

<p>But, what I've done, ever since I started making pour over coffee after watching Alton Brown extol it's virtues on Good Eats, is to use a tea pot with the lid closed and just pour slowly through the whistle-hole.</p>

<p>It kind of skunkifies the tea pot if you've got sort of hard water (even happens to me with reverse-osmosis water), but it hasn't ruined the whistle-hole of the teapot and it does a good job to control the flow and it's cheap and a multi-purpose solution.</p>

"<p>I strongly assume that, if the looks from people all over the world vary, then also there metabolic system should vary and wonder, if there are noticeable differences in how caffeine affects especially Asian people.

"<p>I do not consider myself an expert, but I do remember one study done on this.

This would require substantially more effort, but may be worth it if you are particular about your cream.  Also from the comments below, you may look into a double wall vacuum thermos.  They are increasingly popular and come in a wide variety of qualities and prices, so do your research before buying.</p>

<li>Simply referring to coffee with whitener (e.g., milk, creamer, etc.);</li>
<li>A Lebanese drink <em>ahweh bayda</em>, made from water, orange blossom water, and (perhaps) sugar (more <a href=""http://www.tasteofbeirut.com/white-coffee-ahweh-bayda/"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>)</li>
<li>Something called <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ipoh_white_coffee"" rel=""nofollow"">Ipoh white coffee</a>; of Malaysian origin, this refers to beans that are lightly roasted with margarine (and perhaps sugar and wheat), brewed and served with sweetened condensed milk.</li>
<li>Coffee beans that are roasted to the ""yellow"" roast level, then ground and prepared as espresso; the result is a pale yellow brew with a nutty flavour and assertive acidity.</li>
<li>A beverage originating in Yemen, probably from the literal translation <em>qahwa bayda</em>. I've never had this, and can't find consistent information on it, but things that I have seen suggest that it's any number of different preparations, including the following: coffee made from lightly roasted beans plus spices; or a spiced coffee cherry tea (e.g., <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qishr"" rel=""nofollow""><em>qishr</em></a>); or even something non-coffee similar to the Lebanese variety above.</li>
<li>A longer shot (so to speak...) is that it could indicate a <a href=""http://www.bonappetit.com/trends/article/flat-white-coffee"" rel=""nofollow"">flat white</a>, which is a coffee drink similar to a cappuccino or latte but with higher proportion of milk.</li>
<li>There is also a company called <a href=""http://www.whitecoffee.com"" rel=""nofollow"">White Coffee Corporation</a>, but perhpas not what you're looking for.</li>

"<p>It sounds like both you (and @Chris) are talking about liquid cream or creamers that resemble liquid milk in some way. If you're willing to stray from that...</p>

<p>Though I wouldn't eat them myself, consider also <em>powdered</em> creamers. These can be based on dried milk (which is very nearly still food), or on non-dairy stuff (partially hydrogenated oils, etc., which I don't know what they are).</p>

<p>As for the safety aspect of your question, you have basically zero time at room temperature for milk to be truly safe. According to <a href=""http://www.clemson.edu/extension/hgic/food/food_safety/handling/hgic3510.html"" rel=""nofollow"">this page</a>, bacteria starts growing at about 45°F / 7°C; it'll get there pretty quickly if not cooled. Practically speaking, you have <em>some</em> time but it is not hours. I thought I had seen a chart of time-at-temperature (e.g., safe for 1 hour at temperature X, 30 minutes at temperature Y, etc.) but I can't find anything like it now.</p>

"<p>To me, a fresh ripe coffee cherry tastes like a rainier cherry, lychee, pear. Not as plump with fruit as a cherry, but similar size and rounder, and yes caffeine. The farmers we deal with will compost the outer fruit material, often let chickens peck around in it, and then they will use the compost on the farm as the soil needs the carbon material back to the ground for the shrub to produce more coffee. </p>

"<p>Is it possible to use other brands of coffee filters?</p>
"
"<p>Yes. Well, if the shape matches. I have never found alternatives for paper filters (patent restriction?), but there are clothes and stainless steel versions available.</p>
"
"<p>If you're willing to do a bit of work to save a bit of money, <strong>consider folding your own filter out of filter paper</strong>. For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>I have used very large basket filters in a cone filter in a pinch (they can be <em>really</em> cheap; here's <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B004NEWA1Q"" rel=""nofollow"">one example</a> for about one penny/cent each). You can fold them in half twice, and they fit fine, or even just jamming the thing in the cone works if you're in a hurry. :)</li>
<li>Actual non-folded filter paper, such as <a href=""https://www.seattlecoffeegear.com/chemex-unfolded-half-moon-filter"" rel=""nofollow"">this half-moon shape</a>, intended for Chemex but would also work in the similar cone shape of the V60.</li>
</ul>

<p>For completeness, here's some more info in the ""shape"" topic: </p>

<p>There are <em>three primary ""cone"" filter shapes</em>, with examples from Amazon and other outlets:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B0000CFQKW"" rel=""nofollow"">Melitta</a> style (available in sizes including ""#2"" (most common), ""#4"", and ""#6""); these are passable in a pinch but really don't fit well.</li>
<li><a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B0000CF3HB"" rel=""nofollow"">Chemex</a> style; these tend to be larger, thicker, and more expensive; they produce a slightly different filtration. These will basically work in a V60 cone (but not the other way around: DO NOT consider using V60 filters in a Chemex!)</li>
<li><strong><a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B001O0R46I"" rel=""nofollow"">V60</a> style</strong> (available in sizes including ""01"", ""02"" (most common), and ""03""); As @Eric states in his answer, I haven't found a ""generic"" brand of this shape of paper filters.</li>

"<p>Expanding comment into a (possible) answer...</p>

<p>On the topic of <strong>different beans in a burr grinder:</strong> I find that my (admittedly <em>cheap</em>) burr grinder ""chokes"" on darker-roast beans. When I put dark roast beans into the grinder, the chute gets clogged with coffee grounds more quickly (as compared to lighter-roasted beans). I have a timer-based auto-shutoff model, and much less grounds come out when the grinder is ""clogged"" in this way. I attribute this clogging to the oil on the surface of the beans that is somehow ""sticky"" and more prevalent on darker roast beans, but I'm not certain. <a href=""http://coffeegeek.com/forums/coffee/questions/318466"" rel=""nofollow"">This article from Coffee Geek</a> talks about cleaning more frequently for darker roast beans, as does <a href=""https://www.seattlecoffeegear.com/learn/videos-home/ask-the-experts/burr-test-medium-dark-beans"" rel=""nofollow"">this review from Seattle Coffee Gear</a>, as does <a href=""http://www.coffeereview.com/coffee-reference/from-crop-to-cup/grinding/burr-grinders/"" rel=""nofollow"">this one from Coffee Review</a>. </p>

<p>On the topic of <strong>espresso pulled from these grounds:</strong> This is tricky and I'm really just speculating. Perhaps it's a similar situation: your darker-roast beans respond to tamping differently than your lighter-roast beans. If you're tamping hard and the grounds are clumping together somehow, you might be getting some channeling (resulting in uneven extraction); this could cause a more ""watery"" shot. You might be able to see evidence of this in the puck after you pull the shot, or you might be able to see it while pulling the shot if you use a naked (bottomless) portafilter. <a href=""https://www.home-barista.com/espresso-guide-diagnose-extraction-problems.html"" rel=""nofollow"">This article from Home-Barista</a> talks about a too-quick extraction being paired with grind flaws; are you seeing that? It also discusses various other flaws and corrections, too various to summarize here.</p>

"<p>Maybe a bowl with ice in it, perhaps an insulated bowl or container that is big enough to hold the creamer container and sufficient ice to keep it cold.  I worked at a temporary office for an insurance co. and that's how they kept it cold.  The small cooler is a pretty good idea also.  </p>

"<p>Well, I don't know anaything about keurig, but as the Question stands for a Week I give it a try.</p>

<p>From my expierience with electronics, there are 3 ways how a low power mod could be done, depending on the details.</p>

<p>the first is to mod the power supply to the boiler (e.g. put an inductor in searies) and hope the machines software can cope with this.</p>

<p>second: If you do have to modify the software(and are able to, Replacing the controller  and reimplement the software may be required) you could implement a pwm regulation of the heating(your power line got to survive short overloads of ~0.1s)</p>

<p>third: The boiler has a to small heat capacity for a full cup and needs to draw full power during the pouring of coffe (my machine does this when it has to make a large cup). You have to change the boiler (bigger one might be to big for the case,) and then continue with one of the steps.</p>

<p>Note: If this can't be done in the fashion of “the nerd in the next cubicle does it for free coffe and no one ever is to talk about the mod” but you have to employ an external firm and need to match safety regulations you are almost definately cheaper off by upgrading the power supply to the office.</p>

"<p>Well even decibel ratings did not prove to be quite best thing to measure, because they also depend on different things, some noises aren't as disturbing as others,... There are hand grinders, which are quiet but the question is - do you really want to grind by hand?

"<p>I know it's not <em>really</em> coffee, but I fell in love with ""Caffe d'orzo"" on a trip to Italy.  I seems to be ground, roasted barley run through an espresso machine.  The shots don't taste quite like espresso, but grassier, milder, and less oily than coffee (in a way that I sometimes crave).
Can I make it--or something like it--conveniently without living on the Mediterranean?  I think some expensive ""pod"" (N)espresso makers sell pods for it in Italy.  If I could figure out the roasting myself, I might even invest in a countertop espresso maker, but I don't want to ruin expensive equipemnt.</p>

"<p>There are some <a href=""http://www.thinkgeek.com/product/96b3/"" rel=""nofollow"">really small coolers</a> that go for about $20, powered by USB.

"<p>You should be able to find the roasted barley itself in an international food store, often sold for steeping like tea (a tisane). It is often called <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roasted_barley_tea"" rel=""nofollow""><em>mugicha</em></a> (Japanese) or other names. When prepared for tea, it is sometimes sold blended with, e.g., green tea, so be sure to check the label. Alternatively, a home-brewing outlet will probably have roasted, malted barley available. This will be even sweeter and maltier still. </p>

<p>Amazon also sells <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B0002BKIRW"" rel=""nofollow"">roasted barley for tea in bags</a>.

<p>I think your idea to brew in a moka pot is a good one, but you'll have to find a grind that works well: I suspect a grind just a bit coarser than you would normally use for moka would be a good place to start. I don't think you need to be worried about equipment damage, but I haven't tried this (yet!). Next time I can get my hands on some <em>mugicha</em> I think I shall!</p>

"<p>I have quit drinking coffee many times, and it was never that difficult for me to do, but can never stay quit for more than about 3 or 4 weeks.</p>

"<p>You could always switch to Redbull...</p>

<p>Well in all seriousness, here are a couple of tips you might want to try. </p>

<p>First I want to start with a question. Why do you not want to drink it anymore? If you start drinking it black and make it yourself, it can be cheap and healthy. And you can still get through your day. </p>

<p>Second, try drinking it black. If you're like most people, you probably add half coffee and half creamer, then a bunch of sugar/sweetener. Just drink it black. You might find yourself making/drinking it less.</p>

<p>Third and final tip. Have someone that lives in the same place as you hold you accountable. Get rid of all the coffee. Have a little more will power. I know it's ""not that easy"", but I was able to quick drinking it for a while. </p>

<p>This info is ""reliable"" due to the fact that I drank coffee for years and then gave it up for about 4 months for a challenge. </p>

<p>Let me know how it goes. And if there are any tips to add, please do. </p>

"<p>I will suggest to eat dark chocolate, no less than 72% (90% will make sense, bring up to speed), I was addicted too but with this method I did started to slow down with coffee. I tried switch with tea and was not working so good. Try also to chai tea (has caffeine too). 
Other thing is DO NOT start the morning right the way with the coffee, just wait for at least 1 hour and also need to find out timing when you really need coffee. 
this way I switched from 1/2 gallon a day of coffee to simple cup (craving a lot of fruits during the time spending on computer). 
Also try to not use other products containing caffeine(soda). And keep hydrated as much possible (H2O).</p>

<p>Is more to add but the most important i did listed. 
P.S. I also spend a lot of time at computer (School &amp; Work). </p>
"
"<p>I would recommend you try quitting in the same manner people who smoke quit.  Taper down.  Cold turkey sounds awesome, but the reality is that it hurts.  Caffeine is a physical addiction and the withdrawal symptoms can be ugly (headaches, fatigue, etc.)</p>

<p>You may want to start by figuring out how much coffee you consume and make a plan to cut back.  I thought about quitting at one point, but realized I was just drinking far too much coffee (6+ cups a day).  I've found that a cup in the morning and a cup in the early afternoon is a tolerable addiction for me.  </p>

<p>As far as returning to ""normal"".  It is possible, but will likely take time.  Keep in mind, that by normal you mean not under the effects of a psychoactive drug.  You will be getting rid of caffeine addiction's side effects as well as it's benefits.</p>
"
"<p>I know that ideally, I should keep my ground coffee in an airtight, opaque container.</p>

<p>Currently, I'm limited to one that is airtight, but glass, and one that is opaque, but not that airtight (it's actually a bag with a zip seal).</p>

<p>While I get around to getting a decent new container, which is the best to keep my ground coffee in?</p>
"
"<p><strong>I value <em>sealed</em> over <em>opaque</em>.</strong> Go for the sealed glass. <em>Opaque</em> is not really the goal, but rather <em>in the dark</em>. Keeping the stuff in a dark location, even in a clear container, will be fine.</p>

<p>As far as priorities for storage in general, <a href=""http://www.ncausa.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=70"">according to the USA National Coffee Association</a> (and others including <a href=""https://bluebottlecoffee.com/frequency/store-coffee?tonx=1"">Blue Bottle</a> and a <a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2010/10/the-coffee-storage-conundrum-how-to-keep-beans-fresh/64118/"">lengthy missive from The Atlantic</a>), there are <strong><em>four things</em></strong> that are most important for coffee freshness; that is, <strong><em>minimizing exposure</em></strong> to the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>air</li>
<li>moisture</li>
<li>heat</li>
<li>light</li>
</ol>

<p>... <em>in that order</em>, according to NCAUSA (first link above). That is, keep it <strong><em>sealed</em></strong> (minimizing airflow and humidity, most important), <strong><em>cool</em></strong> (but not cold/refrigerated), and <strong><em>in the dark</em></strong> (somewhat less important). The best place to do this is in an airtight container in a dark, cool pantry. If kept in a dark place, you don't even need to make the container opaque. Lastly, the ""light"" factor is the lowest in priority, so ""mostly dark"" is probably good enough.</p>

<p>I tend to re-use coffee containers for this purpose (I have a bunch of <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B001E5DYTO"">illy cans such as these</a> that work well, are a good size, and have a one-way valve on the bottom). Once you buy the coffee, the tins are ""free""!</p>
"
"<p>It's likely better to completely dissolve the coffee before adding creamer. I'm inexperienced with instant, but with regular brewed coffee and tea, the addition of cream impedes the brewing/steeping process.</p>
"
"<p>Carefully keep track of your coffee consumption with a log / journal, and plan out a long-term (a few months) schedule to gradually phase out your consumption amount. In addition to how much you drink each day and how many times, you should also record any observations on technical capabilities and mood depressions, so that you get a feel for how much faster or slower you should reduce the consumption.</p>

<p>Also, when you make coffee for yourself, start making coffee the opposite of your taste. You drink an instant mix with half &amp; half added, right? You like it sweet? Make it black. Don't add half &amp; half. Add stuff that you hate, maybe cinnamon. You will still get the caffeine kick, but your body will slowly begin to adjust.</p>
"
"<p>A couple of months a ago I broke my daily caffeine habit because I disliked waking up every morning already ""needing"" caffeine. But, I LOVE coffee and I LOVE the buzz caffeine provides. So, for the past couple of weeks I have remained disciplined in having caffeine every third day. My reasoning is based mostly on the fact that the first 48 hours of withdrawal is the worst part of it, so I thought that by waiting 72 hours, I could have my buzz a few times a week without developing a chemical dependency.</p>

<p>Does anyone have anything science-based that can further inform me as to whether my thinking is right on this?</p>
"
"<p>I'm not a pharmacologist, but I have done some research into this. AFAIUI all drugs have a measurable half-life in the body due to metabolism of the component chemicals. Broadly, there are water-soluble compounds which have a relatively short half-life (up to a few days), and insoluble compounds which typically have a much longer half-life.</p>

<p>The half-life (just like with radioisotopes) is the measure of the length of time for half of the compound to be eliminated. Depending upon the critical mass required to have an effect and the quantity consumed, it may take several periods of halving before the compound is <em>out of your system</em>.</p>

<p>If 72 hours gets you to where you don't feel the ""dependency"", it might be possible to reduce that by controlling your caffeine intake when you do drink coffee. You could try half-caff (IMO best to make your own blend, and don't skimp on the decaf part: Decaf should cost more because it costs money to decaffeinate the beans). </p>

<p>You could also try alternating with hot chocolate or a flavorful herbal tea (my latest fav is Yogi Teas Egyptian Licorice). A significant part may be the psychological aspect of the <em>ritual</em> of having a cup of hot coffee. Having a cup of hot <em>something</em> may just satisfy that need.</p>
"
"<p>I kicked it by switching to caffeine pills so that I could carefully taper down. Before I started the process, though, I went to caffeineinformer to get a good estimate of my daily habit. I then used caffeine pills to replace the milligrams of caffeine I was having as coffee. From there, I began to cut the pills into quarters and slowly reduce my intake over the course of several months. Each Saturday I would step down by one quarter of a pill. Withdrawal was minimal and by Monday I was back able to work. It took discipline and patience.</p>

<p>One unintended, but huge benefit that I found by going this route is that I disassociated the buzz with the ritual and smell of coffee. It became clinical for me. Plus it was quite easy to control <em>when</em> I took my caffeine. I no longer had to make or find coffee to get my fix.</p>
"
"<p>As annoying as it is, I would say venture to say that making a month's supply of cold brew is not a great idea. Normal cold brew will begin to lose its flavor after a week, if you're lucky a week and a half. </p>

<p>I would try to either make smaller amounts that you can consume in a week or less. If you're making it traditionally, this shouldn't be a huge amount since you'd be diluting the brew upon drinking it with water.</p>
"
"<p>Nearly every coffee machine has the milk go through this device which not only heats it up but causes it to froth up.</p>

<p>Why is this important for a coffee? What's wrong with just heated milk?</p>
"
"<p>It's not that <em>just heated</em> milk is wrong or tastes bad.
It's only that there are some (popular) coffee drinks that uses <strong>steamed</strong> or <strong>frothed</strong> milk (are not the same, read <a href=""http://www.gaggia-usa.com/skills/steaming-vs-frothing/nav/60"">this</a>) by traditional way.</p>

<p>On those popular drinks you can find the cappuccino, latte, etc... (as you can see on this <a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/PaN3b.jpg"">infographic</a>), but at home you always can add regular hot milk to your coffee (but we all agree that it isn't feel and taste like the regular way).</p>

<p>Last, why are those techniques important for a coffee? I think that gives a different flavour and tasting to the drink, due to its consistency (and of course, that let you to do some pretty nice latte art)</p>
"
"<p>So my roommate and I have been a bit intrigued by brewed coffee after watching tokyo ghoul (lol)</p>

<p>We got some BonCafe grounds(southeast asia brand) at a supermarket and brewed it with a filter. Have to get sugar and milk inside.</p>

<p>He bought some whole beans (looks medium roasted) and grinded it and also drip brewed it. Even more bitter than the seemingly darker BonCafe.</p>

<p>And in Aeropress with a AbleBrew disk fine metal filter it taste even more bitter and sour than the drip brewed variants.</p>

<p>Then I got an idea from turkish coffee where you directly mix coffee grind with water without filtering. (well there is further boiling involved in turkish coffee but whatever)</p>

<p>Then after pouring in water and mixing it with coffee groind with a spoon for like 10 seconds, and letting the ground set, it tasted (to me and him) surprisingly better than drip brewing and aeropressing.</p>

<p>And to me there is coffee taste inside.</p>

<p>Recently I got some old (2014 September) lavazza qualita oro ground coffee, tried aeropress and direct mixing, same thing happened. </p>

<p>So is that the “what you are supposed to get from coffee” taste quote the connoisseurs? Or is it underextraction or something? But why isn't I seeing any recommendation on this brewing method? Am I doing anything wrong with the aeropress and drip brewed ones? (to me they taste both sour and bitter) </p>

"<p>There's only one real reason to quit coffee: YOU'RE DYING.</p>

<p>Jokes apart.</p>

<p>Method 1:</p>

<ul>
<li>Grab 3 days of medical leave.  </li>
</ul>

<p>NOTE: No driving for these 3 days. Have painkillers, only and only if the pain gets out of hand. Those things have side effects. </p>

<ul>
<li>Have people around you so that you can get medical help ASAP. </li>
<li>Stop. Just stop. Reflect on your health conditions. </li>
<li>Deal with the withdrawal symptoms.  </li>

<p>Method 2: </p>

<ul>
<li>Reduce the amount of your coffee by 60mg or so every day.</li>
<li>Weaker withdrawal symptoms but still watch out. Get someone else to drive, preferably.</li>
<li>Just before you reach the caffeine amount of 0, continue the minimal amount that for 2 or 3 days right until to hit the brake forever.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: I never thought I might have said this but have decaf for visual pleasure.</p>

<ul>
<li>SUCCESS!</li>
</ul>
"
"<p>I'm not exactly sure if this is accurate, but I think it has to do with flavor extraction. </p>

<p>When you brew with a filter, the water is going to fall through the grounds too fast to actually develop good flavor. Sure, you'll get coffee, but you're only giving the water enough time to take the more bitter tastes with it. I have this same problem with my coffee.</p>

<p>When you brew directly into water, all of the water is in contact with all of the grounds for a considerably longer amount of time. The water will extract the bitter tastes AND the more flavorful aspects of the grounds, which is why you thought this tasted better. It wasn't just bitter, it was bitter and flavorful, and that's coffee.</p>

<p>You're not doing anything wrong with the filtered methods, it's simply a matter of opinion among coffee tasters. Some people enjoy the convenience of fast, filtered, and bitter coffee because it's what they know as coffee. The reason the Turkish method isn't suggested is because, the way you describe it, it sounds like the grounds stay inside the coffee, and many people loathe having to deal with that--even though it produces much better coffee.</p>

<p>So no, you're not doing anything wrong; however, the reason you're finding flavor differences is that the extraction of flavors is far different between the two methods!</p>

<p>You could switch back and forth between caffeinated and decaffeinated until a day on the decaf seems bearable.</p>

<p>You could mix the two, with a larger proportion of decaf over time.</p>

<p>You could switch to/rotate in another form of caffeine. (Pills (not recommended unless you have a fairly large caffeine intake, then you may want to look into it), or teas.</p>

"<p>Oh yeah! I used to get that stuff! Cameron's if I remember.

Maybe a little cinnamon too. I thought it was reminiscent of spiced rum... maybe a rum flavored extract could get you where you are going.</p>

"<p>I visited Milano previous summer, I ordered ""Caffe al Ginseng"" in several places and I enjoyed a lot this coffee. Now I would like to order this kind of coffee on-line, but the shipping is quite expensive from Italy and there are too many options.</p>

"<p>Some options.</p>

<p>Have you tried freezing the cream, then using it as it melts?   This works for bottles of milk, but I have never done it with cream.</p>

<p>Fill an unglazed clay pot with cold water, putting in cream in a sealed container in the pot, was the water enverperates from the damp sides of the pot, it cools the pot.    To speed up the process put the pot in front of your desk fun.</p>

<p>A sealed container in the flush tank of a well used WC may work, if the cold mains water is cool enough,  when camping a river is used in that way.</p>

"<p>I have a Fresh Roast SR500 home roaster and have had some success roasting mostly drinkable coffee.  My first attempts, following the instructions enclosed with the roaster turned out horribly, tasting both charred and grassy at the same time.  Yeechh.  After doing some online reading, I've greatly lengthened the roasting process with mostly good results.  I'm currently roasting batches of 90g of raw beans for between 12-17 minutes.  My thinking is that this is giving the beans time for the proper reactions to take place inside the beans without charring the outside.  But I've read that some commercial roasters might take 20 minutes or more to roast a batch.  Of course they are roasting much larger quantities than I am but it occurred to me that perhaps this longer roasting time is intentional and has some beneficial effect.</p>

<p>I'm mostly aiming for a City or City+ roast level and want to know if lengthening the roast time beyond what I'm currently doing is a good idea?  I would still stop the roast soon after First Crack, but I suppose I could stretch out the time to get there if that might produce a better product.</p>

"<p>You can <em>absolutely develop a dependency</em>.
The important thing to remember is that there are physical and mental aspects to addiction. If you look forward to it hard enough, <em>any</em> amount of time can pass and you can still crave it just as deeply. Sometimes a deep craving can even result in symptoms that shouldn't be explainable by chemical explanations [Psychosomatic effects].</p>

<p>It would also depend heavily on dosing. You would want to make sure that you don't try to compensate for your days off by going on a binge and placing yourself directly under the espresso maker until you've had 3 days worth! In fact, that could make the problem worse because the difference between your ""on days"" and off days would be so much greater you might await those days the same way a junkie looks forward to their next hit.</p>

<p>droog has the right idea. Try to see if there are ways to rotate in other substitutes for coffee. Maybe you enjoy the hot drink, or you look forward to the short break it takes to prepare it. Regardless, people just don't go well with negative feedback. If you feel as if you are deeply depriving yourself, then change your approach. The way to be successful is to find a way that cuts down your caffeine intake while also not feeling as if you have lost something.</p>
"
"<p>It does matter for a couple of reasons.</p>

<p>Drawing out the roast generally produces more even results.</p>

<p>Slower roasts mean that you have a better chance of stopping the roast at the target level and not over or under roasting.</p>

<p>You can search the online forums for some of the home roasting sites, but many people run their roasters at a higher setting, then turn down the heat once the roasting process is rolling.  Some of the more expensive machines even have ""roast profiles"" preprogrammed to modulate the temperature up and down for desired results.  </p>

<p>Personally I think there is a point of diminishing returns between the time dinkering with the roaster and the difference in the taste.  Most of my roasting lands in the 15 to 16 minute range and comes out even enough that I feel good about it.  I recommend drawing the time out just enough that the results are even enough for you and you are comfortably hitting your target roast level the vast majority of the time. </p>

"<p>I'm using the Hario V60 for quite some time and I always used the V60 filterpapers which are stated to be the best for my ceramic dripper. I never thought about it, until a friend of mine ask me whats special about them and why I don't use normal papers which will quite fit into them too and are much cheaper.</p>

<p>Honestly, I couldn't answer it for sure. I just thought about it, that I read something about a different paper structure but as I said. I'm not sure with this. </p>

<p>Is there any real difference between the V60 paper and normal filters or is it just the fact that they will fit better into my ceramic dripper?</p>
"
"<p>I'm using the V60 dripper from Hario and was curious about the grooves inside the dripper. I think that they are present to slow down the water running through the filter and let the water pass as much as coffee powder as possible, but I'm not really sure. Is this really the intention of this grooves?</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/pkFso.jpg"" alt=""Dripper""></p>
"
"<p>These grooves are for improving the flow of coffee through the filter. The grooves create space between the filter and the cone to permit little channels for the coffee to flow into the vessel after passing through the filter paper. I think the ridges also help ""wick"" the coffee away from the filter paper, helping the filter paper drain better.  </p>

<p>If the ridges are absent (as in Chemex cones, for example) the brewed coffee sometimes wells up between the filter paper and the cone. See also <a href=""http://coffee.stackexchange.com/q/1658/262"">this question</a> and <a href=""http://coffee.stackexchange.com/a/1660/262"">my answer that compares the two styles of cones</a>. </p>

<p>As for the shape and location of the grooves, some are spiral-shaped, others are straight, staggered, etc. I don't notice any advantage of any style as long as they're present, and I suspect the shape and location is purely aesthetic or marketing, not significantly different in any functional way.  </p>

It would be great if I can get a small induction hob that I can just keep in the dining room to use when I fancy a post-dinner tipple. Another benefit for an induction hob is that it shouldn't get significantly hot, making it ideal for the dining room.</p>

"<p>This question is not about molds that affect coffee plants. I am asking about molds that grow in coffee that has been sitting for a few days or more. I did not find any scientific articles on point so I have begun to try to answer the question by observing; but I may have missed an article and someone else may know the answer already. </p>

<p>Roasting probably kills any mold in coffee beans and if molds grow in a cup of brewed coffee they come from the surrounding air. After leaving many partially-filled cups in various spaces and looking at molds that grew in them, <em>Aspergillus</em>, <em>Penicillium</em>, and <em>Aureobasidium</em> are the only molds I have seen under the microscope so far.</p>

"<p>The question here is about the following primitive method for making coffee. Having used this method for many years now I think it gives consistently good coffee, comparable to that from a good espresso machine but without the need for machinery or paper filters.</p>

<p><strong>Recipe:</strong> Bring one cup's worth of water to a boil in a small pot. Add about a scoop and a half of ground decent-quality beans to the pot. Swirl gently until chalky bubbles appear. Filter through a tea strainer into a cup. Let stand briefly. </p>

<p>No need to grind the beans to a powder. The tea-strainer gets most of the grounds and the amount of sediment in the cup is about the same as in cafe espresso. The only electric component is a coffee grinder. Using pre-ground beans requires more coffee per cup, as some flavor will be missing.</p>

<p>In general this method produces coffee that is slightly weaker than espresso. While I might add a bit of sugar to espresso to counter bitterness if the beans are old or mediocre, the strainer method above gives coffee that is very drinkable without sugar. </p>

<p>It sometimes surprises me that this simple method isn't more widely used. <strong>Has anyone else tried it?</strong> Are there any drawbacks to this method? It isn't worth much commercially because it only makes decent coffee one cup at a time.  </p>

<p>This method is adapted from one I saw used by fisherman in Brazil, except he used a sock instead of a tea strainer. Comments welcome.</p>

"<p>I had a recent discussion with a friend of mine, which is the right <em>method</em> to brew the coffee for pour-over.</p>

<p>I read that it's best to pour in hot (but not boiling) water into the filter and moisten the coffee powder. After that I should pour in the water until it is round about 1 cm over the coffee powder. After that I should let it flow out and fill the water up until it's reached the 1 cm mark over the powder.</p>

<p>His method is a bit different. He just pours the hot (even if it's still boiling) water into the filter. He briefly moistens the coffee and then lets the rest of the water pour into the filter until his water can is empty. He only pauses from pouring if it reaches the top of the filter. </p>

<p>I said that his method isn't good, as the water will flow faster through the filter and the coffee won't be as aromatic as it would be with my method.</p>

<p>The brewing process I'm using is using the hand-filter with the Hario V60.</p>

<p>Which method is better? Does it matter how fast to pour the water in? Does it matter if the water is just hot or still boiling?</p>
"
"<p>Though I don't have any articles on the matter, I can certainly say I've found cups of coffee that I had forgotten that are only maybe a week old with mold growing in them. I'd assume it gets contaminated so quickly, because of its sugar content. It might just be a coincidence, but it seems to happen more readily with coffee that I brew over ice. I press my areopress directly over ice, I've heard this reduces the acidity. Which would make sense, as acidity usually wards off mold. I leave all of my coffee black and unsweetened, so it is not dairy or added sugars that are causing this.</p>

<p>Perhaps try variating your brewing process. I'd be especially keen on the pH. Maybe there are some spores which will not grow in environments below a certain pH.</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/BlhFe.png"" alt=""moka pot funnel with arrow pointing to crimp""></p>

<p><strong>What is the purpose of this crimp?</strong></p>

<p>It is indented toward the middle of the funnel (i.e., not protruding out of the funnel). It's far too low to indicate recommended ""fill line"" for quantity of grounds (for my taste anyway!) There's no other attachment that fits into it, nor does it engage with any other part on the pot (e.g., the top lip of the funnel sits on the moka pot base). It's one piece of sheet metal; e.g., this isn't a point where two pieces attach. Some moka pots have funnels that have this crimp, and others are solid/flat around the side.</p>
"
"<p>OK, I've worked this one out. This little thing is called a <strong>reducer</strong>.</p>

<p>What you can do is put the reducer into the funnel. It should sit on the indentation half way down. You then put coffee on top of it. This allows you to make less coffee with a larger pot.</p>

<p><em>However</em>, although I haven't tried it yet, it seems that most people complain that the quality of the coffee reduces (!) significantly. Many complain of a weaker brew. It's probably better to use a smaller pot if you regularly want to make less coffee.</p>

"<p>The crimp is there to support the <a href=""http://coffee.stackexchange.com/a/2026/127"">reducer</a>! The reducer slots into the funnel, and sits on the ridge. You then put coffee on top of it, allowing you to use less coffee in larger pots.</p>

"<p><strong>Short version:</strong> The Hario brand filters are <strong><em>thinner than other paper filters</em></strong> and seem to have <strong><em>more texture</em></strong> than other types of filters. I assume this has some, but perhaps slight, impact on the <strong><em>rate at which water passes through the filter</em></strong> and also <strong><em>what ""stuff"" passes through the filter</em></strong>, which impacts the resulting brew and its taste.</p>

<p><strong>Longer version:</strong> The rest of this response is basically a comparison of the Hario filters to other types of filters. This isn't particularly authoritative nor scientific. I don't immediately find any good online resources on this; one video that I don't care to link or watch, and another article from <a href=""http://drinks.seriouseats.com/2011/11/best-ceramic-coffee-dripper-pourover-hario-bonmac-bee-house-kalita-reviews.html"">Serious Eats on dripper styles</a> but it doesn't compare the filters themselves as such. So, I'm going rogue.</p>

<p>The different cone (and filter) manufacturers each have their own shape, presumably to ensure product lock-in for consumables (in this case, primarily filters). Here are the three primary ones that I'm aware of:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/NqO7d.jpg"" alt=""brown paper filters"">
Clockwise from upper left: off-brand Melitta-style #2, Hario brand V60 02, Chemex brand pre-folded bonded. All are ""natural"" brown (unbleached, etc.) varieties.</p>

<p>My basic summary, having looked at these three examples from my own stockpile (certainly, this is a small sample) in order from thickest to thinnest:</p>

<ul>
<li>The Chemex filter is very thick; almost more like like a thin pressed cotton cloth or fabric. Almost completely opaque. <a href=""http://www.chemexcoffeemaker.com/filters.html"">The Chemex filter page</a> states that they are ""20-30% heavier"" than other filters and removes finer sediment and ""undesirable oils and fats"".</li>
<li>The Melitta-style is in the middle, and is similar in nature to most other Melitta-style and basket-style filter paper. Thick enough to be mostly opaque, but noticeably thinner than Chemex. The <a href=""http://www.melitta.com/en/2-Cone-Filter-Paper-Natural-Brown-40-Count-1428,64752.html"">Melitta brand filters</a> have claimed ""flavor enhancing perforations.""</li>
<li>The Hario brand is the thinnest by a fair margin. It's almost translucent through most of the filter, with a somewhat leaf-vein-like pattern to it, presumably from paper fibre and production method. This brown (""natural"") style seems to be called ""Misarashi"" for reasons I don't understand. There's little information on the Hario (<a href=""http://www.hario.co.uk/coffee/v60-filter-papers.html"">.co.uk</a> / <a href=""http://www.hario.jp/product/list.php?middelclass=2"">.jp</a>) pages about the nature of the filters.</li>
</ul>

<p>Frankly, I don't notice a significant difference in coffee draining rate (throughput), but I suspect there is. I (personally) think there's a slight difference in taste and output of the brew, but perhaps I'm fooling myself into legitimizing more coffee gear.</p>

<p>As stated in <a href=""http://coffee.stackexchange.com/q/1969/262"">this other question about Hario V60 filters</a> off-brand filters do not seem common (in our regions).</p>

"<p>When heating milk with steam, aerating the milk (the process of drawing in air which creates foam) is essential to allow the milk to heat gently, without scalding. If you're using some other heating process, you'll have to take care of preventing scalding in some (other) way.</p>

<p>An extra benefit of foam &mdash; particularly <em>microfoam</em> where the bubbles are too small to see &mdash; is that it changes the surface tension of the liquid beverage, potentially allowing more taste-buds to come into surface contact. So you get <em>more flavor</em> bio-chemically. As (good) baristas know, tiny bubbles taste better than big ol' <em>soap bubbles</em>. This theory explains why.</p>
"
"<p>You're highlighting two differences between the two methods:</p>

<ul>
<li>temperature of the water, and</li>
<li>rate of pouring the water (equivalently, how ""full of water"" is the cone).</li>
</ul>

<p>Short story: Use water just off the boil (about 96°C / 205°F). I prefer your ""slower"" pour method over your friend's... read on for why.</p>

<p>Longer story:
Keeping all other factors identical, here's my take on each. I aggregate information from my own experience and from several other sites (including <a href=""https://bluebottlecoffee.com/preparation-guides/drip"">Blue Bottle</a> and <a href=""https://www.stumptowncoffee.com/brew-guides/bee-house"">Stumptown</a> and <a href=""http://www.seriouseats.com/2014/06/make-better-pourover-coffee-how-pourover-works-temperature-timing.html"">Serious Eats</a> and <a href=""http://coffeegeek.com/guides/howtouseapourover"">Coffee Geek</a>).</p>

<p><strong>Temperature.</strong> Most agree that water for pour-over should be <strong>just off the boil</strong>, but exact temperature is both difficult to <em>measure</em> and to <em>maintain</em>. Exact recommendations differ, but most (including the 4 above) are approximately in the range of <strong>93-97°C / 200-207°F</strong>. At this temperature, you extract the best balance of the ""right stuff"" from the beans. Much hotter or colder than this and it will have an ""off"" taste, such as more bitter. For example, try brewing coffee at 80°C / 175°F and see how it tastes compared to coffee brewed with 96°C / 205°F water.</p>

<p>With <em>my</em> technique and equipment, anyway, it would be essentially impossible for me to measure or maintain a temperature this accurately. Removed from the heat, the kettle itself will immediately start to cool; the water will cool between the pour spout and when it hits the grounds in the cone; the water will cool more when sitting on the grounds. For this reason, <em>I take water from a boiling kettle and begin to pour at my leisure.</em> It might be a few degrees too hot at first, but it will probably finish a few degrees too cool.</p>

<p><strong>Rate of pouring the water.</strong> This seems to have more debate, e.g., on the 4 sites I listed above. Some pour only enough water at a time to have water just covering the grounds (like you and Blue Bottle), and some pour all the way up to the top of the cone (like your friend and Stumptown) -- however, a disadvantage of this all-at-once method is that some of the coffee will get pinned to the side of the cone for the final ""drainage"" and will not spend as much time in contact with the water; therefore some of your friend's coffee grounds will be underextracted. <strong>I do something of a hybrid: pour at such a rate as to keep the <em>output</em> at a steady rate.</strong> The dripping rate will decrease as the filter gets somewhat clogged with grounds, so I keep very slowly raising the water level in the cone (just exceeding the rate of output); I find this produces the best result. Other ideas are to stir (as Coffee Geek suggests) or pour in batches (as Serious Eats suggests).</p>

<p>All that said, other factors (e.g., the quality and freshness of beans) are overwhelmingly more significant than the manner of pouring.</p>

"<p><strong>Can I use an AeroPress to brew Maxwell House?</strong> It seems like most people around here drink fancy coffee but they don't sell it where I'm from. I asked the lady at the grocery store if she had Sumatran beans and she gave me a funny look.</p>

<p>I searched, but I don't see anyone who has tried it. Think it will work?</p>
"
"<p><strong>Yes, of course!</strong> As ""fancy"" coffee company <a href=""https://counterculturecoffee.com/learn/any-coffee-any-brew"" rel=""nofollow"">Counter Culture says: <em>Any Coffee, Any Brew</em></a>. In fact, even things that <em>aren't</em> actually coffee (barley, tea, herbs, etc.) could be brewed like coffee in an AeroPress or other coffee-brewing equipment.</p>

<p>But if fancy coffee is not your preference (or not practical, or not available, or whatever), try something different. And why not a cultural staple like Maxwell House (or Folgers or Nescafé or Eight O'Clock or Café du Monde or ...)?</p>

<p>In fact, a <strong>mass-market coffee like this might <em>benefit</em> from AeroPress treatment.</strong> For example, some of these blends include a significant portion of <strong><em>Robusta</em></strong> beans, which is a traditional component of many blends (including some Italian espresso blends). Robusta might have some advantages in an AeroPress. <a href=""http://coffeegeek.com/opinions/barista/10-14-2006"" rel=""nofollow"">Robusta produces <strong>more crema</strong></a> in espresso, and might be a way to get <a href=""http://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/58/whats-the-most-effective-way-of-generating-crema-from-an-aeropress"">more crema from AeroPress</a>. Robusta also has slightly <strong>more caffeine</strong> than <em>Arabica</em>, so that's something else you might be looking for. Since AeroPress (generally) infuses for less time than drip, <strong>you might reduce a bit of the bitterness</strong> sometimes present in mass-market coffees (regardless of bean makeup).</p>

<p><strong>There might be a few problems, though.</strong> First, the default grind of pre-ground coffee like <strong>Maxwell House is rather course</strong> for an AeroPress. You could try to re-grind the coffee to be a bit finer, but it's generally not recommended because it can clog grinders (see more on this from <a href=""http://www.home-barista.com/grinders/can-ground-coffee-be-re-ground-t29153.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Home-Barista</a> and <a href=""http://www.bunn.com/dr-brew-blog/re-grinding-coffee"" rel=""nofollow"">Bunn</a>). Second, if there are other ""stuff"" in the coffee (e.g., ""Folgers Crystals"" or other additives) this might not behave the same way in the AeroPress as it might for drip.</p>

<p>But give it a try! In the best case, you can enjoy a mass-market coffee even more than you'd expect. In the worst case, you're out a few quid, but you have a fun story and a hefty caffeine buzz.</p>

"<p>I have seen some varieties of unroasted coffee beans listed as a dry process.  What exactly is this referring to?</p>
"
"<p>Your story sounds very familiar.  I used to make several home make double-cappuccinos with my machine everyday.  Then I'd miss a day and be in pain.  My head pounding.  I was in distress.</p>

<p>I have tired to quit drinking several times, however, I found I really love the taste and could not.  That was my drink of choice. </p>

<p>What I have done is to lower my intake.  I didn't do it the way RJC said, but logging how much you drink is a great idea.  Start limiting your intake.  Don't go from six cups a day to one cup in two weeks.  You built up your tolerance (and need) for caffeine over a long period.  If you don't want any lingering effects, you'll need to do the same when you cut down.  My suggestion is to cut down one cup per month.  Get your body and mind used to the new amount.</p>

"<p>With the dry process, the fruit is left intact for an initial fermentation stage. Then the beans are hulled, washed, dried again, sorted and graded (as with other processes). </p>

<p>It's more expensive than other processing methods because of the real-estate and time and labor invested in the initial fermentation. But it seems to get <em>more fruit</em> into the bean. Dry-processed coffees tend to have very complex fruit and wine notes that are not found (or rarely found) in washed and semi-washed process coffees.</p>

"<p>We recently found this old vacuum pot at my grandparents`. It seems to have all the parts needed for brewing, but no separate heater.

"<p>Great find! How fun. You do indeed have a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_coffee_maker"">vacuum coffee maker</a> -- a.k.a. vac-pot, syphon, or siphon.</p>

<p><strong>This style of vac-pot is intended to be used on a stove-top</strong> (specifically: having a flat bottom, and with a handle on the neck of the bottom part -- the ""bulb"") -- looks a lot like <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B00005NCX5"">this current model from Bodum - c/o Amazon</a>. There's a good primer on <a href=""http://www.wecravecoffee.com/siphon-vacuum-coffee-makers-a-complete-guide/"">the history and types of vac-pot at WeCraveCoffee</a> with some good pictures.</p>

<p>However, in general, <strong>glass pots are generally not recommended on flat <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass-ceramic#Cooktops"">glass-ceramic cooktops</a></strong> for a couple of reasons: they can <em>scratch or otherwise damage</em> each other, and the poor conductivity of glass makes glass-on-glass heating <em>less efficient</em>. More info on this from <a href=""http://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/23051/what-kind-of-cookware-is-suitable-for-a-glass-ceramic-stovetop"">a question on Seasoned Advice</a>, and recommendations from <a href=""http://www.geappliances.com/search/fast/infobase/10000221.htm"">GE Appliances</a> for their own stovetops. I did see some products <a href=""http://www.dhgate.com/product/unified-little-mini-electric-ceramic-stove/235473464.html"">such as this one</a> that depicted glass vac-pots on glass-ceramic cooktops. If all of the glass is high quality, as should be expected for cookware intended to be used on a stove, it <em>should</em> be able to withstand the temperature changes induced by a cooktop. I (personally) would be comfortable using this vac-pot on a <em>gas</em> flame, but cautious/wary of using it on glass-ceramic cooktop. Glass cookware works well over gas flame, but I have less experience with glass cooktops... your ""mileage"" may vary.</p>

<p>For a more ""DIY"" adventure as you suggest, <strong>consider a mechanism to suspend the vac-pot over a flame heat source</strong>. Other styles of vac-pot (such as <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B000IKLQY6"">this Hario model - c/o Amazon</a>) have a scaffolding that holds the bulb (bottom) and the hopper (top) so the whole apparatus can be suspended over a separate heat source, like an alcohol or butane stove. Check some vac-pot brewing guides that show this type of integrated round-bottom bulb and holder (e.g., from <a href=""https://bluebottlecoffee.com/preparation-guides/siphon"">Blue Bottle</a>, <a href=""https://www.stumptowncoffee.com/brew-guides/vacuum-pot"">Stumptown</a>, <a href=""http://coffeegeek.com/guides/siphoncoffee"">CoffeeGeek</a>, and many others). Warning: this may remind you of Chemistry lab from School. ;-) And of course be careful with fire.</p>

<hr>

<p>Separately, just for completeness...</p>

<p>It also looks like you're missing the filter piece. These are inexpensive (relative to the whole apparatus) and you'll want to purchase a new, compatible one anyway (see also another question on <a href=""http://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/253/how-often-do-i-need-to-change-the-filter-on-a-siphon"">siphon filter replacement</a>). </p>

<p><strong>Another thing you'll want to check is that the rubber seal between the bottom and top parts is still in good shape</strong>, especially if this pot hasn't been used in a few decades. This is for reasons both practical (you need a tight seal for the vacuum to work well) and safety (you don't want the seal to come lose and spray boiling-hot water everywhere)!</p>

"<p>Is there any notifiable difference between coffee beans grinder by an automatic grinder or a manual grinder like a hand-crank?</p>

<p>I see many people to swear on their manual grinder (me too) but I'm curious if there may be some difference. In many coffee shops there is an automatic grinder which puts a kilogram of coffee through in a few seconds. </p>

<p>I have the temperature in mind. Maybe this change the taste of the coffee?</p>
"
"<p>You could try adding a paper filter between the wire filter and the frame. This should at least help keep the grounds out of the cup. </p>

<p>I also think you want to pay attention to extraction time as well as finding the right dose. Fine-ground coffee will extract faster, so you may want to try steeping for only 3 minutes (or even less), and then transfer to a preheated thermos or insulated teapot so it doesn't keep brewing until your second cup. </p>

<p>Also, there's an old cowboy trick for grounds in your cup. If you add a splash of cold water, it will carry the grounds to the bottom as the cold descends. I merely report this practice. I have not vetted the science.</p>
"
"<p>The most important differences I think, are <strong><em>time</em></strong> and <strong><em>temperature</em></strong>.</p>

<p>I really don't know much technical details about grinders, but as @luser-droog said, friction will create heat and <strong><em>it will</em></strong> affect the coffee (so, motor grinders can be affected by this if doesn't manage heat dissipation well)</p>

<p>And of course, in all cases, <strong><em>time matters</em></strong>; so, time might be a crucial factor for someone. </p>

"<p>A fine grind, especially an espresso grind, are usually avoided when doing immersion brewing methods. Reason being that their extraction times are so low that is usually not practical to press a fine grind coffee. Though this isn't a <em>direct</em> answer to your question, I'd recommend grinding your coffee directly before brewing. This is best practice, and it means you can grind your coffee to whichever coarseness that you need.</p>

<p>If you want to french press this coffee I think it would be best to adjust your extraction time. If you're using an espresso grind I'd do a short bloom, then extract for 45seconds. If the coffee is sour or bland increase extraction time. If the coffee tastes too bitter, then try decreasing the extraction time. Bloom for maybe 8 seconds. It's hard to tell, most people press coffee because they like pressed coffee, and they'll usually use a coarse grind for this. Using a fine grind will likely negate the benefits of using a press pot, and could very well be impossible/very difficult to consistently get a good cup.</p>
"
"<p>The biggest drawback is that you might add the grounds to too hot water. Especially avoid adding the coffee to water that is still boiling. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_preparation#Boiling"" rel=""nofollow"">Wikipedia</a> has some references about the temperature and it states that boiling water will extract bitterness instead of aromatic oils. So just make sure to wait a moment after taking the water off boil.</p>

<p>Second drawback is that since the grounds remain in the pot in contact with the water, you have to empty the pot entirely once the coffee is ""done"". Leaving the grounds in contact with the water for longer times will only add betterness to the coffee. Of course this is no problem if you only make one cup, but prepare to have a (pre-heated) container ready if making more cups.</p>

<p>Related to the second drawback is that the extraction will continue in your cup because of the sediment, but in my opinion most people will not even notice it affecting the cup.</p>

Since this coffee is not paper filtered it contains more oils. Some like the taste, some do not. Some link coffee oils to cholesterol levels (I do not..), which might be a personal drawback to some.</p>

<p>Offtopic: the method you describe is actually how my granny makes coffee, with a little twist (that I dislike). After adding the grounds, she heats the water to boil <em>again</em> and quickly removes it from the stove after first signs of boiling.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Just wanted to mention that none of the drawbacks I listed is unique to this method.</p>

"<p>Well actually it is obvious that they are pretty fast. But to the proffessionals i ask : does Starbucks's coffee is not organic ? not healthy ? or includes so much chemicals ? I do realize it depends on the type and flavour of coffee but , anyway .. </p>

<p>I , buy at least 1 cup coffee from Starbucks a day , usually Filter coffee without milk or Americano. Should I stop shopping with them ?</p>

<p>Basicly , I'm asking if it is unhealthy to frequently drink filter coffee(without milk) or Americano from Starbucks , like if it is real coffee or something artificial ?</p>

"<p>As far as actual speed, that based mainly on the barista working shift, the load, and amount of available equipment.  Starbucks does not have any patented magic equipment that  lets them pull shots faster than any other coffee house (that I am aware of).  </p>

<p>If you enjoy their beverages, then there probably isn't any reason you shouldn't continue to drink it.  I would guess you are in the minority of people buy what amounts to black coffee from Starbucks.  Starbucks is a fairly divisive brand among most consumers.  Most of the people I have talked to that like their beverages are buying mixed drinks from them and not straight espresso, drip coffee or americanos.  </p>

<p>Starbucks does sell organic, fair trade and the like specialty coffees as whole bean or ground.  However, the vast majority of their beverages sold daily is likely made with whatever their ""espresso"" blend is.  My personal opinion is that it's horrible and over roasted.   However, it's also consistently the same tasting and consumed on a fairly mass scale daily, so if there were any inherent dangers to it, we'd likely all be aware by now.</p>

<p>As a brand, Starbucks is mainly aimed at consistency.  In general, that's what fast food chains strive for as well, so in that respect, they are very similar.  Proper branding ensures that you can buy a product at any of hundreds of locations (or thousands) and it will taste the same.  However, many consumers prize quality and uniqueness over consistency.  In most industries (distilling, wine, food, beer) the most expensive and ""highest end products"" are items that were perhaps only produced at a limited run, or were very good in a particular year.  That mindset tends to be the antithesis of the mass produced ""good enough for everyone"" standards that huge market brands set for themselves.  </p>

<p><strong>TL;DR Summary:</strong>  Yes, Starbucks shares many characteristics with fast food companies.  The most notable aspect being their branding strategies and tactics.    </p>

"<p>In the Philippines some people roasted their rice to make a substitute for coffee, this rice is uncooked rice. But I doubt if it is safe?</p>
"
"<p>While I never heard of rice as <a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_substitute"" rel=""nofollow"">coffee-substitute</a>, people have used roasted malted barley, spelt, chicory or dandelion roots or even acorns (and other foods) to make a dark, aromatic brew that was used either separately or mixed with coffee, especially in times of scant resources.</p>

<p>I suppose the rice would not be burnt<sup>1</sup> (because that would taste horrible), but roasted instead. Healthwise it is perfectly safe, like the other options mentioned above. Just note that rice has no caffeine, so you wouldn't get the ""kick"" you get from real coffee.</p>

"<p>I like the answers already here, but want to add on a bit.</p>

<p>Coffee freshness is an extremely important variable when selecting coffee. There are roughly <a href=""http://www.coffeeresearch.org/science/aromamain.htm"">800 volatile molecular components</a> found in coffee and much of it evaporates within several days of resting and/or minutes after grinding. A true coffee snob is very interested in a ""roast date"" rather than a ""best by date"" because it gives you a read on freshness rather than the fabricated ""expiration"" that the roaster arbitrarily puts on the bag. Imagine selecting bread at a bakery and they won't tell you the day it's baked, it is rather mind boggling!</p>

<p>Since starbucks is an international chain, coffee freshness does not become a economical priority when servicing thousands of stores and millions of customers. Roasted coffee sits in warehouses until it is finally delivered and used by the barista or bought off the shelf by the consumer. It appears that Starbucks shelf-life is 12 months according to their <a href=""http://globalassets.starbucks.com/assets/dcc4d0d527b14099a21cf664586bcfa1.pdf"">Standards for Food Suppliers</a>.</p>

<li>Fit top pot (with coffee grounds)</li>
<li>When water has all gone up into top pot, and bubbling starts, turn <em>off</em> heat, but leave entire pot on diffuser, on heating element</li>

<li>Remove (carefully) whole pot (both parts together) from diffuser - I slide it to a cold area of the hob</li>

<p>On table B, we have some fine coffee and a cheesecloth.</p>

"<p>I have been a barista at Starbucks going on 13 years now. So I do know some things, but I'm not speaking officially on their behalf. Any errors of fact or inference are my own.</p>

<p>The core ingredients Starbucks uses are real ingredients. Coffee, milk, filtered water. Not all of the coffees are organic, but there are efforts underway throughout the world to reinvest in the farms and communities, etc etc. I'm sure there are specific priorities in each area, and going (California-certified) organic is not necessarily the highest. Education, clean water, economic concerns could each be more significant to a specific area (just speculating, and rationalizing; but it's all reasonable, right?).</p>

<p>Some stuff is more artificial. <del>The pumpkin sauce.</del> (They fixed the Pumpkin Sauce.) The whipping cream is a little thinned with skim milk and thickened back up with carrageenan. But the mocha sauce is just cocoa, sugar, vanillin, hot water + elbow grease.</p>

<p>For some other detail-ish concerns, there are things like food coloring. Now AFAIK, Red no.40 is what everybody uses to add red and pink to stuff. So the choice is natural or artificial? Easy right? What if I tell you they're indistinguishable in a lab? Still easy, right? What if I tell you the natural version is extracted from bugs? Yeah, insect extract. Now let's consider: natural or artificial? Still easy?</p>

<p>I'm not even sure which is in the pink cake pops at the moment. But, if you're getting something bright pink, how worried are you really? Is that wrong, to turn the whole question back? I don't know. But if you take any of these ""health fiascos <em>du jour</em>"" too seriously, ... um, where was I going with that? Just keep your brain turned on, as per usual.</p>

<p>One litmus test I use to rate other stores is whether they keep their shot glasses rinsed. If they do that, then they most likely have the other standards for cleanliness and quality under control. If they don't, please suggest that they read my instructions on <a href=""http://coffee.stackexchange.com/a/1940/959"">(Re-)Calibrating the Mastrena machine</a>.</p>

"<p>I think the most important part of your question is about the <strong>quality</strong> of the grinder in question. You have cheaper manual grinder, middle grade grinder (e.g. <a href=""http://www.hario.jp/product/list.php?middelclass=1"" rel=""nofollow"">Hario grinders</a>) and high end grinder (e.g. <a href=""http://hg-one.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">HG One</a> or <a href=""http://www.oehandgrinders.com/OE-Manual-Coffee-Grinders_c_1.html"" rel=""nofollow"">OE Pharos</a>). The same goes for automatic one where you have cheap bladed grinders all the way up to Mazzers.</p>

<p>Higher end grinders (both manual and automatic) won't have notable difference in grind quality (e.g. the HG One has the same grinding burrs as the Mazzer). Both type will allow to pull great shots. The most notable difference will be in grinding speed, counter space used, price paid and your coffee making enjoyment. </p>

"<p>I have just recently started drinking coffee, and have got myself a small counter top espresso machine. </p>

<p>Some people in work have suggested that instead of buying ground coffee (I have been using Lavazza ground coffee) I should buy beans and grind it myself. I have asked why, but no one has been able to give a better answer than ""it just is better"", so I am hoping someone here can help me find a better answer to this question. Or is it just personal preferences?</p>

<p>Also, as a newcomer to this, I know that the coffee someone uses is down to personal tastes and what have you, but I am just wondering if there are any coffee manufacturers who are very good when it comes to espresso (I mostly drink espresso).</p>
"
"<p>Ground beans have a much larger surface area by weight than whole beans. When the surface of the bean is exposed to air chemical reactions take place. I doubt that these reactions have been completely characterized but at a minimum they include some loss of aromatic oils. In other words, the processes that lead to a judgment that coffee is ""old"" happen faster in ground coffee.  </p>

<p>You can do the experiment easily and cheaply by comparing the results of coffee made with freshly-ground and pre-ground versions of same brand/date coffee. You can always borrow a grinder.</p>

<p>The experiment might not work if both samples of coffee are old (or poor quality). Otherwise I think you would notice a difference. Whether the difference is worth paying for is a different question; but the only costs are a grinder and time to grind the beans. </p>

<p>A short answer to the question about brands might be: good, fresh Arabica beans are similar in many ways, up to roasting. Some people prefer a light roast, others medium or dark. Once you decide, find a brand that does what you like consistently. </p>

"<p>I've got these spots on the inside the bottom section of my Bialetti Moka Express:</p>

<p><a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/Y21rR.jpg""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/Y21rR.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>They are placed pretty evenly around the ridgy part toward the edge of the bottom of the circle, with a few toward the middle. They are only on the bottom of the pot as far as I can tell, not the sides. They look sort of like black mold, but I gave the pot a gentle scrub with warm water and a mild soap and they didn't budge.</p>

<p>I don't normally use soap on my pot. Generally I make a cup of coffee, rinse all components, and allow them to air dry. Sometimes when I'm pressed for time, the just-used pot sits in the sink for a few hours without getting disassembled or rinsed. I have a hunch that that moisture may be contributing here. I use filtered water, so I don't think they are mineral deposits (unlike in <a href=""http://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/1847/moka-pot-buildup"">this case</a>). The pot is pretty new. It's been used 1-3 times per day for about three weeks.</p>

<p>So what are these spots? If they aren't affecting the flavor of the result, do I need to worry about them? If so, how can they be removed?</p>
"
"<p>Short story: <strong>They are probably aluminum oxide</strong>, but almost certainly some kind of metal oxide. <strong>You don't need to take any action unless they're affecting the taste of your coffee</strong>, and it shouldn't be. You probably <em>can't</em> (or <em>shouldn't</em>) really permanently remove them even if you wanted to.</p>

<p>Longer story...</p>

<p>This is a <a href=""http://www.bialetti.com/coffee/stovetop/moka-express-c-1_7_22.html"" rel=""nofollow"">classic Bialetti</a> model, and a classic Bialetti symptom. The vessel is probably made out of alumin[i]um alloy (though there are similar models that are made of stainless steel, your picture seems to be looking down into the bottom heating vessel, and it looks like the classic aluminum species). Unfortunately the symptoms you're seeing, from my perspective, is a classic <em>failure</em> of the Bialetti design. Aluminum tarnishes (oxidizes) somewhat readily, especially when it is hot and in contact with water. Correspondingly, the only way to use this thing is, indeed, to heat it with water.</p>

<p><strong>The vessel, especially, needs to be rinsed and <em>dried thoroughly</em> in The Right Way.</strong> The <a href=""http://www.bialetti.com/coffee/stovetop/moka-express-c-1_7_22.html"" rel=""nofollow"">""care"" page for Bialetti</a> (follow that link, then click on the ""Care Use"" tab; I can't figure a direct link) suggests to <em>dry thoroughly</em> and most tellingly ""Do not reassemble the product until all parts are completely dry to avoid oxidation."" Even if you're meticulously drying the thing, it's still going to be a little hot and a little damp; this is going to invite oxidation. </p>

<p>Standard ways of removing tarnish are even more damaging in the long term than just leaving them alone. Aluminum oxide generally protects the metal from further oxidation (unlike rust -- iron oxide -- which flakes off and <em>facilitates</em> further oxidation).</p>

<p>I have a stainless steel moka pot, and it's terribly tarnished on the outside from heating on a gas burner hundreds of times, but the inside is clean (and clean<em>able</em>) as the metaphorical ""whistle"".</p>

<p>For completeness: It's also possible that they are mineral deposits; <a href=""http://coffee.stackexchange.com/a/1849"">this answer</a> to the other question that you linked has some additional info about that possibility. It would come from a buildup (""scale"") from using ""hard"" water, and more so when nearly boiling dry (also not a good idea); filtered or distilled water is much less likely to do this. However, I think it's unlikely that you'd see scale buildup over the span of a couple dozen uses.</p>

"<p>Similar to what @hoc_age said, the metal might be too old and too easy to melt under high heat.</p>

"<p>Bali coffee is made by tossing finely ground coffee directly in the water (no filters, etc.).</p>

<p>Does this change the amount of caffeine in the coffee, compared to coffee from a filter machine?</p>

<p>(Coffee produced on Bali is generally Robusta rather than Arabica which means it has more caffeine, but I would like to know about the change in caffeine due to the process alone)</p>
"
"<p>The amount of caffeine in your cup will depend, as with any method, on the extraction time. It also depends on everything else, e.g. the grind, temperature of the water, but I can't find any information on what these typically are for Balinese coffee, so I'm going to assume they're the same.</p>

<p>Assuming you're using the same coffee with each method, the main thing that will vary is the extraction time. With pour-over methods, this will depend on the size and shape of the funnel, the porousness of the filter paper and the grind itself.</p>

<p>For Balinese coffee, there is no control. If you mix the coffee and water directly, the only thing limiting the extraction time is how long you wait before drinking it.</p>

<p>However, having said that, caffeine is actually extracted rather quickly. <a href=""http://www.pjbs.org/pjnonline/fin2208.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">This study</a> finds that routine percolation removes almost all soluble caffeine. However, the extended extraction time for Balinese coffee is likely to make a bitter brew.</p>

<p><strong>In conclusion, no</strong>, you won't get more caffeine in Balinese coffee compared to filter. Both methods will remove almost all caffeine from the coffee.</p>

<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espresso"">Espresso</a> is coffee that is brewed by and is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>is coffee brewed by forcing a small amount of nearly boiling water under pressure through finely ground coffee beans.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It has one of the most highest amount of caffeine of any other coffee drink per unit volume, so you would expect American and any type of coffee involving espresso will lots of caffeine. Well that depends on how much coffee you are drinking as espresso is served in smaller portions.</p>

<p>There's no such thing as Espresso Lungo, it's actually just called <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lungo"">Lungo</a>. Another Italian coffee, this coffee is and is brewed by:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Lungo is Italian for 'long', and refers to the coffee beverage made by using an espresso machine to make an Italian style coffee - short black with much more water, resulting in a stretched coffee, a lungo. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now don't be fooled by this as to make this coffee, you need an espresso machine
to make this creation. You just need more-than-normal amount of water and short black (single or double dose or shot). This coffee will have less caffeine than the above coffee types.</p>

<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ristretto"">Ristretto</a> is more of the opposite of Lungo. It uses regular ground coffee with less-than-normal amount of water:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ristretto is traditionally a short shot of espresso coffee made with the normal amount of ground coffee but extracted with about half the amount of water...  The opposite of a ristretto is a lungo, which is typically double the shot volume. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is also Italian and literally the opposite of a Lungo. It also has less caffeine than American or espresso since it only uses a short shot of espresso and regular ground coffee, similar to Lungo.</p>

<p>So, American and espresso have the highest caffeine content out of the four, and Lungo and Ristrtto have less caffeine than the above. I would say that espresso has the highest of all in fact but American still looks pretty high in caffeine too.</p>

"<p>If you do decide to pursuit (or at least try) grinding yourself, keep in mind, all things being equal, you want to grind your coffee beans at the last possible second (reasons already given by @daniel).</p>

<p>Also, you will want a coffee grinder which can produce an even grind fine enough for espresso.  At the lower end of the price range (under $100), this generally means ceramic burr grinders.  The $10 blade grinders from Walmart can't really give an even grind.  Good quality manual ceramic grinders, such as the ones made by Hario, are fairly cheap, but being manual, it means getting a good arms workout. ;)</p>

"<p>There have been articles in the news about coffee rust affecting coffee crops in many places. After reading this <a href=""http://www.apsnet.org/edcenter/intropp/lessons/fungi/Basidiomycetes/Pages/CoffeeRust.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">article</a> it dawned on me that not only is <em>C.liberica</em> (resistant to rust) being exported in large quantities from some places (Phillipines, for example), Colombian researchers have developed resistant hybrids that may well be replacing <em>C. arabica</em>--to some extent-- in South America as well. </p>

<p>If I go to my local coffee place and get a (relatively) expensive espresso my assumption is that the beans are <em>arabica</em> unless otherwise indicated. If you look at a futures contract for coffee, there is a big premium for coffee from certain countries, in part because it is assumed to be <em>arabica.</em> Is this still true and, if not, what percentage of coffee labeled <em>arabica</em> is actually <em>arabica</em>? </p>

<p>My link is now broken and in response to the comments I am going to add links on efforts to (partly) replace Arabica with resistant species or hybrids.

"<p>Are there any chemicals or dyes in most common paper towels that would be harmful if I brewed my coffee using the towel as a filter?</p>

<p>If it is safe, will it affect the taste of the coffee at all?</p>

"<p>Paper towels!? Knock yourself out!</p>

<p>In this <a href=""http://lifehacks.stackexchange.com/a/5642/2475"">answer</a> in Lifehacks.SE, the accepted answer includes instructions to create a coffee filter out of paper towels. The full instrctions:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I tried to create a similar filter device with a paper towel and it worked perfectly.</p>
  
  <p>Here is what I did:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li><em>First</em>, make sure you have paper towels... seems foolish to mention, but hey... its true!
  
  <ul>
  <li>Approximate the size of your basket with your hand and tear a circle out of the paper towel bout an inch (+/- 2cm) wider than the basket size.</li>
  <li>Place the paper into the basket and push the center down to touch the bottom.</li>
  <li>the ""buckled"" edged should then be folded into an accordion (similar to the shape of a normal filter) -- this will help to maintain a ""wall"" for the water and grounds so they do not overflow into the drink.</li>
  <li>Place the coffee grounds into the basket in a normal fashion and brew.</li>
  </ul></li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>My formatting skills are rather rusty... So in conclusion, it's safe to use paper towels with no risk or worry! But I'll answer your concerns for you.</p>

<p><del>Since when do paper towels need dye? They're white, so no need for artificial colors here, all they need is some machine to make the cool patterns and all the other cool stuff. Same goes for chemicals.</del> Read the comments for that answer for more information about chemicals that may be inside the paper towel. White paper towels are usually the ones with the lowest chemical content compared to other colored paper towels. </p>

<p>According to the comments, brown paper towels will make your coffee taste like one. Not good at all. Bleached towels should be avoided as they contain bleach or CI (chlorine). And who knows what hidden chemicals could be used in the non-bleached ones, any from A-Z really. So use the paper towels with caution as you might be drinking bleached coffee instead...</p>

<p>Depending on how strong your paper towel is, the strength of your coffee will vary. Quote from same answer used for this one.</p>
"
"<p>So as far as I can tell, some kitchen towel can contain a variety of potentially nasty chemicals, including bleach. While it's only likely to be trace amounts, I'd avoid doing this except in an emergency. </p>

<p>The best towel to use if you do is <strong>microwave safe</strong> kitchen towel, which has a minimal amount of stuff in it. </p>

<p>As for the taste, I imagine it's going to vary hugely on the towel you use, but at the end of the day it's going to be very difficult to control the brew. </p>

<p>Stick to filter paper whenever possible, have a backup pack. </p>

"<p>Lets's do some <em>Espresso math</em>:</p>

<p>Taking an espresso<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup> as base unit, we can conclude:</p>

<ul>
<li>A ristretto<sup>3</sup> uses less (typically: half as much) water than an espresso for the same amount of grounds. This means the amount of water for one serving will flow through them faster, meaning less caffeine can be extracted. (But a ristretto is quite aromatic as mostly the quickly soluble compounds get drawn out.)</li>
<li>For a lungo<sup>4</sup> it's the other way round, resulting in more caffeine per serving. (Typically resulting in more ""bitter"" compounds present.)</li>
<li>An americano is an espresso ""thinned"" with hot water, resulting in the same caffeine amount than an espresso - because that's what went in.</li>
</ul>

<p>So the caffeine per serving would be:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>ristretto &lt; espresso = americano &lt; lungo</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>(This does not consider that all these drinks can be made with double or triple shots, but the math stays the same.)</p>

<hr>

<p><sup>1</sup>For completeness and as the question came up in comments: According to the <a href=""http://www.espressoitaliano.org/files/File/istituzionale_inei_hq_en.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">Istituto Nazionale Espresso Italiano</a> an espresso is made with 7g coffee per 25ml cup.</p>

<p>On naming:<br>
The terms for coffee varieties all contain an <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellipsis_%28linguistics%29"" rel=""nofollow"">ellipsis</a>, effectively omitting the word <em>Caffè</em> (coffee):</p>

<p><sup>2</sup> Espresso means ""expressed"", referring to the preparation method where water is pushed with high pressure through the grounds, as opposed to coffee from a <em>Caffettiera</em> or made by other methods. (Other sources claim it stands for ""explicitly"", meaning a cup that was prepared individually for every single guest or serving. ""espresso"" is the past participle of two italian verbs. Perhaps a happy coincidence.)</p>

<p><sup>3</sup> Ristretto means ""restrained"". Easy to remember if one keeps in mind that in the old espresso machines water was pumped manually with a long lever - one lever ""pump"" resulting in one cup of espresso. If the movement was restrained: voilá, a ristretto.</p>

<p><sup>4</sup> Lungo means ""long"" - see details above.</p>

"<p>Coffee is tough to quit because like other addictions, it leads to side-effects (e.g. splitting headaches). There are two main ways to quit:</p>

<p><em>The Weaning Method</em></p>

<p>Gradually reduce the amount of caffeine you take in a day. Not just coffee, but soda, energy drinks and tea as well.</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<ul>
<li>Withdrawal symptoms are much less severe.</li>
<li>Most people can continue to function and be productive.</li>
<li>Mild to no caffeine headache to deal with.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cons:</p>

<ul>
<li>Can take longer to quit</li>
</ul>

<p><em>The Cold Turkey Method</em></p>

<p>This is the obvious method that most people will suggest. Quit altogether until the withdrawal symptoms stop.</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<ul>
<li>Can quit much quicker</li>
</ul>

<p>Cons:</p>

<ul>
<li>More severe withdrawal symptoms</li>
<li>Difficult to function and be productive</li>
<li>The headaches are brutal</li>
</ul>

<p><em>If you are trying this method, make sure you let your coworkers and family know beforehand so they are prepared for increased irritability and so they can help. Also, drink lots of water and stay hydrated to decrease the chance of getting headaches. You can always drink decaf for the pleasure of drinking coffee.</em></p>

"<p>I've been roasting coffee for a couple of years now, and I've always used a popcorn popper.  I'm interested in taking things a bit more seriously and would like to be a bit more meticulous when it comes to roast level.  I find that my popcorn popper (1200 W) roasts coffee a little too quickly, to the point that it becomes difficult to get a precise and consistent roast level from time to time.  Does anyone know of anyway that I could reduce the power of the roaster?  If it roasted at a lightly slower pace I feel like I would have better control over the process.  I've heard people suggest plugging it in through an extension cord or a power strip, which will reduce the power going to the popper.  Is there a more principled or controlled way of doing this?  Some sort of device that goes in between the popcorn popper plug and the outlet that would let me adjust the power at a fine granularity would be ideal.  Does this sort of technology exist?  Perhaps a sort of light switch dimmer would work?</p>

"<p>Rather than playing with electricity and wiring you could actually just move the roasting bed/area away from your heat source and accomplish close to the same thing.  </p>

The result was that I moved the coffee away from the heat source.  The sifter also allows you to stir and get more even results.

"<p>To say which of these has the <em>most</em> caffeine is a little bit complex, as it depends on if you mean how much caffeine per ounce vs. how much caffeine in the drink in its entirety. To start, let's explain the drinks.</p>

<p><strong>1. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espresso#Brewing_process"" rel=""nofollow"">Espresso</a></strong></p>

<p>Espresso is the key to this whole discussion. Each of the four beverages you referenced is (or contains) Espresso. Espresso is a method of brewing coffee, by which pressurized water is passed through a compacted ""puck"" of fine grounds. In a traditional espresso shot, roughly 0.25 oz of grounds are used to create about 0.85 oz of Espresso. Caffeine levels vary depending on the coffee beans, but as a mainstream reference, Espresso made by Starbucks contains <a href=""http://www.caffeineinformer.com/caffeine-content/espresso"" rel=""nofollow"">approximately 75mg</a> (they use slightly different measurements, however).</p>

<p><strong>2. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ristretto"" rel=""nofollow"">Ristretto</a></strong></p>

<p>Ristretto is a form of Espresso in which <em>less</em> water is used. So you take the same puck of 0.25 oz of finely ground coffee, but instead of making 0.9 oz of Espresso, you make a <em>more concentrated</em> 0.5 oz (or so). Because the strongest Espresso is the first to be brewed, this is <strong>the most concentrated form of espresso</strong>, and as such has the most caffeine <em>per ounce</em> of any drink on this list. That said, one shot of Ristretto is is less caffeinated than one shot of Espresso simply because there's less of it. As such, if measuring by the amount of caffeine per shot, this is the <em>least</em> caffeinated drink on this list.</p>

<p><strong>3. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lungo"" rel=""nofollow"">Lungo</a></strong></p>

<p>Lungo is the exact opposite of Ristretto. Instead of being an Espresso made with less water, it's an Espresso made with <em>twice</em> the water. As such, a single shot of Lungo has <strong>the most overall caffeine</strong> of any drink on this list, but is less concentrated than either standard Espresso or Ristretto.</p>

<p><strong>4. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caff%C3%A8_Americano"" rel=""nofollow"">Americano</a></strong></p>

<p>This is Espresso with water in it. No, really. A solo Americano has the exact same amount of caffeine as a solo Espresso, however it is watered down, and as such is the least concentrated drink on this list. You could hypothetically make an Americano from Ristretto or Lungo shots instead of standard Espresso, and in doing so make it less or more caffeinated (respectively).</p>

<p><strong>In Summary</strong></p>

<p>Assuming all are made with the same number of shots, the most caffeinated drinks <em>overall</em> are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Lungo</li>
<li>Espresso / Americano (tied)</li>
<li>Ristretto</li>
</ol>

<p>The most caffeinated drinks <em>per oz</em> are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Ristretto</li>
<li>Espresso</li>
<li>Lungo</li>
<li>Americano</li>

"<p>The graph shown is a spider-web graph that is similar to a line graph but in a shape of a spider web.

A score closer to six will have its vertex nearer to the center of the web and a score nearer to 10 will be nearer to the outside. This graph seems to be scoring the different qualities of the coffee.</p>

<p>A Cupper's Correction is used when the grapher thinks that the total score (add all the smaller ones) should be higher or lower. In this case, it's two so the original total score has two bonus points.</p>

"<p>What to keep in mind is, that during the middle ages, alcoholic drinks were pretty much the <a href=""https://beer.stackexchange.com/questions/268/did-everyone-drink-beer-in-the-middle-ages"">main beverage</a>. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Before public sanitation, cholera and other water-transmitted diseases
  were a significant cause of death. Because the process of brewing any
  beer from malt involves mashing and boiling which effectively
  pasteurizes the wort, and the fermentation and hops protect against
  infection, drinking small beer instead of water was one way to escape
  infection. It was not uncommon for workers (including sailors) who
  engaged in heavy physical labor to drink more than 10 Imperial pints
  (5.7 liters) of small beer during a workday to slake their thirst.</p>

<p>To quote from an <a href=""http://gladwell.com/java-man/"" rel=""nofollow"">article</a> by Malcom Gladwell</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What this flood of caffeine did, according to Weinberg and Bealer, was to abet the process of industrialization–to help “large numbers of people to coordinate their work schedules by giving them the energy to start work at a given time and continue it as long as necessary.” Until the eighteenth century, it must be remembered, many Westerners drank beer almost continuously, even beginning their day with something called “beer soup.” (Bealer and Weinberg helpfully provide the following eighteenth-century German recipe: “Heat the beer in a saucepan; in a separate small pot beat a couple of eggs. Add a chunk of butter to the hot beer. Stir in some cool beer to cool it, then pour over the eggs. Add a bit of salt, and finally mix all the ingredients together, whisking it well to keep it from curdling.”) Now they began each day with a strong cup of coffee. One way to explain the industrial revolution is as the inevitable consequence of a world where people suddenly preferred being jittery to being drunk. In the modern world, there was no other way to keep up. That’s what Edison meant when he said that genius was ninety-nine per cent perspiration and one per cent inspiration. In the old paradigm, working with your mind had been associated with leisure. It was only the poor who worked hard. (The quintessential pre-industrial narrative of inspiration belonged to Archimedes, who made his discovery, let’s not forget, while taking a bath.) But Edison was saying that the old class distinctions no longer held true–that in the industrialized world there was as much toil associated with the life of the mind as there had once been with the travails of the body.</p>

"<p>Espresso tastes different than percolator coffee, but not necessarily better.  Espresso extraction produces a more concentrated drink with a different set of compounds that you would get with percolator extraction.  With a shorter extraction time and higher pressure, espresso will have a slightly different set of compounds than you would get from the same coffee with percolation.  </p>

<p>Some people prefer a more concentrated taste, however, some do not (many people think espresso is ""too strong"" when drank straight, thus the popularity here in the US of mixed espresso drinks).  This doesn't mean it's necessarily better.  Some types of beans are not well suited to espresso extraction and will actually produce a better cup when brewed with other methods.  </p>

<p>All coffee can be benefited or hindered by brew/prep method, but the quality of the bean and it's roast have quite a bit of influence in the matter.  Badly grown, processed and roasted coffee will not magically be made better by espresso extraction.  It might actually end up worse because concentrating it can highlight it's flaws.</p>

"<p>Looks like you've got <em>too much ground coffee</em> in the basket. What's the weight that you're using? It looks like the recommended dose for the stock basket is 14g, which is a bit lower than the ""standard"" of 19g or so.</p>

<p>You have an indentation (ring) around the outside of the grounds -- an indentation from the group/dispersion screen (in addition to the notorious protruding center screw on this model). If you're already tamping thoroughly, this could mean you've got too much coffee in there.</p>

<p>Is it possible to do latte-art in this way? I've always seen the coffee being first and then the milk second so I'm not sure if it's possible. </p>

<p>I would like to be able to make latte-art while it's normally operating, so no storing the coffee/milk in other containers and then building it later. Would it be possible?</p>
"
"<p>Latte art typically requires you to pour one thing into the other (the frothed milk into the espresso). You could of course try to move the cup with the milk already in it while brewing the espresso in such a way that the coffee leaves a pattern in the milk. But that will be very difficult and will also look very different from normal latte art.</p>

<p>So no, that will not really be possible. You should steam your milk in a pitcher and pour it from there into the cup with the espresso.</p>
"
"<p>Yeah, why not? Imagine a big container with all of your beans, there are gonna last the same time if you separate it on 3 containers. And the ""oxygen expossure"" will be minimal (not necessary), but at least will be better than having it at one big container.</p>
"
"<p>I store beans two ways, 1. Place bag the beans came in, inside a plastic zip lock freezer bag, squeeze out the air and zip lock freezer bag. Place in freezer, when removing beans, allow to warm to room temperature to avoid moisture collecting on frozen beans after opening. The squeeze air out of original bag, the place inside plastic zip lock freezer bag, squeeze air out of it and refreeze. I do this all the time. 2. Purchase a food vacuum sealer unit and seal-able bags that come with it, add beans to bag, maybe enough for 1-2 weeks of use. Vacuum out the air and seal, place in freezer until ready to use but again, allow beans to reach room temperature before opening bag! </p>
"
"<p>Over fill grind basket loosely then skim off excess grind. Tamp grind to 30 PSI, fairly stout push, make sure grind around perimeter is pressed also. Give a finial press and twist. The size and consistency of grind is important too. My grind is almost the right size, but the first 2 seconds it is liquid-y but quickly transforms to a thick foamy look which is what you want. If it is liquid-y throughout the run the grind is too coarse. Note: I happened to have .001 thick brass shim and was able to place shims under my grinders stationary plate in order to finer grind.</p>
"
"<p>The thinking is perhaps similar to spices. Spices in natural seed form can be stored for years if sealed air tight at room temperature. A similar thought can be applied to coffee beans, but stored for months maximum and not years! Grinding beans just before use can give a fresher/stronger flavor with more natural oils and moisture content.  Now that said, good pre-ground or beans needs good storage. Prepare enough for no more than 1 week of use. What I do and some may disagree but it works for me. Pre-ground that isn't used right away, squeeze excess air from bag, place that bag inside a plastic zip lock freezer quality bag, squeezing air from it and then zip lock seal, place in freezer. Very important to allow frozen bean or pre-grind to come to room temperature before opening to use!!  Another quality pre-ground is Bustello and is an espresso grind. </p>

"<p>I come from a land of tea-drinkers and have only recently taken a fancy to coffee. I just ordered <a href=""http://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B00H34OA7U?psc=1&amp;redirect=true&amp;ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00"" rel=""nofollow"">this</a> coffee-maker for myself, which is the first that I'll ever own. </p>

<p>I am a bit perplexed as to what <em>type</em> of coffee is used in a coffee-maker. It gets all the more confusing since I couldn't get my hands on all the types on the internet.</p>

<p>Until now, I had been making coffee with the help of this Nescafe.</p>

<p><a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/IFWNE.jpg"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/IFWNE.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Is this instant or ground coffee? What is the difference between the two? Can they be used in my coffee-maker?</p>

<p>Along with the coffee-maker, I also ordered myself a bottle of <strong>Grandos Espresso Instant Coffee</strong>. Would I be able to make it with the help of my coffee-maker?</p>
"
"<p>Ground coffee is just the roasted coffee beans ground up to a fine powder. In order to make the beverage coffee, you need to combine this with hot water to extract the flavour (there are many different ways to do this). Typically, there is a filter that makes sure that the water can pass through the ground coffee but none of the ground ends up in your drink. </p>

<p>Instant coffee is dried brewed coffee - they grind up the coffee beans, brew the coffee and then remove the water.</p>

<p>A coffee machine or coffee maker is used for brewing coffee from ground coffee, not instant coffee. Instant coffee powder just needs to be rehydrated, so adding hot water is enough. It will completely dissolve in the water, which the ground in a coffee maker will not.</p>

<p>The machine you bought seems to be an espresso machine (it puts the water with high pressure through the ground coffee). This requires a relatively fine ground. Preground espresso will probably work, or you can also buy a grinder and grind the beans yourself. It also seems to have a pressurized filter basket, which means it will be quite forgiving and therefore easy to use.</p>
"
"<p>The first thing I taste when I make coffee is a wood fiber taste. By the second sip, its gone and the coffee tastes tolerable. </p>

<p>I buy a Costa Rican Arabica roast from BJ's. I buy several pounds and stick it in the freezer. I grind before brewing. Have just bought a Breville Smart Grinder Pro and a Behmor Brazen Plus drip coffee maker (gold tone paperless filter). My grind size on the Breville is 48, the high end of medium according to their guide. However, I might be inclined to call it fine as pictures I've seen on the web lead me to this conclusion. Also, grinds tend to float in the air as I grind. As to the Brazen, I brew at 204 degrees with a 1.5 minute soak cycle. I use eight cups (setting) of grinds to make six cups of coffee. I intend to experiment but I'd like to hear some expert advice also. </p>

<p>So, the question is, can I avoid that wood fiber flavor or am I stuck with it?</p>
"
"<p>That is instant coffee(you only need hot water to make it). Like Niko said ground coffee are coffee beans ground to small bits.</p>

<p>Looks like you've bought a good espresso coffee maker. You need to find espresso coffee for that machine. My favorites are Lavazza <a href=""http://www.lavazza.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lavazza.com/</a> and <a href=""http://shop.meinl.com/default"" rel=""nofollow"">http://shop.meinl.com/default</a> .
I usualy buy whole grain coffee and grind it at my home. 
You can also make espresso coffee using espresso coffee pods (E.S.E. easy serving espresso). Pods are basicaly grounded espresso coffee put in small pods, so you don't have to ground it at home.</p>

<p>If you want to make good coffee with that machine <strong>buy some good quality espresso coffee</strong>. Read the manual for your machine to make good coffee. </p>

<p>Edit: <strong>Don't make espresso</strong> with Grandos Espresso Instant Coffee(<em>don't ever make espresso with that machine if you don't have espresso coffee!</em>), until you buy real espresso coffee you can make instant (put one or two tea spoons in your mug and sip boiled or near boiled water over it)/</p>
"
"<p>The spouts are aligned with the machine front and cup once the portafilter is installed for use in the machine. Note the handle on the portafilter body goes quite a distance over to the side, or it would interfere with handling the cup.</p>
"
"<p>I would suggest buying any other kind of non-flavored coffee (or borrowing some) and using your same parameters to make a pot.  That should determine whether your machine/process is imparting that taste to the beans or if it's just the coffee itself.  </p>

<p>Lightly roasted coffee often has tastes described as woody, grassy, or sometimes tea like.  This can vary from <em>very noticeable</em> at light roast levels to <em>not at all noticeable</em> at moderate levels.  Even if you have purchased those same beans before and were not expecting the taste, it's possible you purchased a bag less roasted than previous bags you have bought. </p>
"
"<p>You have bought a wonderful coffee machine which produces espresso (concentrated coffee) which can be consumed whole or mixed with milk/water to create amazing drinks such as latte's or cappuccinos but not limited to these.</p>

<p>To make it simple for you, I will make a short list of what you need to produce coffee on that machine.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Coffee Beans - I would suggest to step into Starbucks/Costa/Coffee Day or any similar retailer and ask for espresso blend/beans/roast. If you can find the manager, explain the situation and ask for tasting.</p></li>
<li><p>Coffee Bean Grinder - You need something like this <a href=""http://www.amazon.in/dp/B003U2V5GS"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.in/dp/B003U2V5GS</a> or similar, but do make sure that the grinder you buy is capable of producing a fine grind, as we want the coffee powder to produce espresso, this is crucial.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The coffee you produce with this method will be divine, the aroma will fill up your spaces for sure. What is critical is that you store the beans in their original form and grind only what you need, that will produce the freshest and tastiest coffee.</p>

"<p>I've noticed that coffee made with my Aeropress has a much richer flavor even though I use the same water temperature, number of scoops, roast, etc.</p>

<p>Is this because the Aeropress method produces crema (the tawny substance found in espresso shots)? And, if so, is there a way to optimize crema extraction with an Aeropress?</p>
"
"<p>As Niko said, the answer is NO. I was not familiar with the cappucinatore, but assuming <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYXsPQ0TzIE"" rel=""nofollow"">this</a> is how your milk is steamed, it is just way too frothy for latte art. Even if you had it poured into a pitcher first and then into the espresso it will not work. You need microfoam, not froth to do latte art. </p>

<p>The long and the short of it is that to texture your milk properly, you need to be able to control how much the milk is stretched (which is simply not possible with this ""cappucinatore"").   </p>
"
"<p>In essence it's pressure, temperature and how coffee is generally ground for the method that make the difference. </p>

<p>Espresso forces water at high pressure (generally about 250PSI) and a specific temperature (generally between 92 and 94 degrees Celcius) through ground coffee. Percolator coffee relies on gravity to move water that's generally boiling (100 degrees) through coffee. The water temperature does make a significant difference because it is possible to burn coffee with water - which is one of the reasons that to many espresso drinkers filter coffee tastes burnt. </p>

<p>Grind makes a significant difference as well, Espresso coffee is generally ground finer than drip filter coffee which makes for a more intense taste for the volume of liquid. As per Chris' post, roast and been quality makes a difference - although I'd slightly disagree with Chris and say that it's more than a hindrance. The same bean ground for espresso and produced by an espresso machine and then ground for and produced by a drip filter will taste much different - and he's right in saying that it will highlight a really bad bean. It is also part of the skill of good baristas though that they know how to grind and extract almost any bean to get the best out of it, I know baristas who adjust for humidity though too so how far you can go is a guess for me.</p>

"<p>I'd recommend firstly mapping your local market in order to identify your local competitors and focus on for example:
What they have to offer? 
What makes them unique?
What products they sell?
Who are their suppliers and their clients?</p>

<p>With that in mind you'll need to think about what products you wish to sell? Anything and everything? Or specialise on a bespoke/specialist range?</p>

<p>With that focus source the products/prices and then the hard work of business development/marketing begins!</p>

<p>Good luck!  </p>
"
"<p>As another dimension, I see a few trends that you might wish to consider.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Green beans.</strong> More people are getting into home roasting, and green (processed but un-roasted) beans are the vehicle. Also, green beans store better for longer time (e.g., freezing) so you can capture a particularly good ""year"" or crop of beans for a longer period of time. Even whole, unprocessed cherries might be an interesting notion. </li>
<li><strong>Skins and pulp.</strong> People make beverages out of the (usually discarded) fruit skin and pulp, called <em>cascara</em>, <em>qishr</em>, or other names. These are difficult to find dried, and perhaps impossible to find fresh.</li>
<li><strong>Direct marketing.</strong> Another trend is (broadly) the ""farm-to-table"" strategy, where roasters or cafes will purchase beans directly from farmers. There might be good business in brokering ""direct"" deals like this, by helping responsible farmers with good beans get good prices by selling directly to the end user (e.g., a local roaster) instead of through an aggregator or warehouse. You could seek out some exceptional beans with unique qualities and get those farmers into the specialty direct trade market. </li>
</ul>

"<p>If I drink coffee everyday, will I be addicted to it, or is it just a myth?</p>

<p>Is there any risk to my own health due to caffeine?</p>
"
"<p>According to <a href=""http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00213-004-2000-x"">this review</a> published in Psychopharmacology, it is very much not a myth.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The caffeine-withdrawal syndrome has been well characterized and there
  is sufficient empirical evidence to warrant inclusion of caffeine
  withdrawal as a disorder in the DSM and revision of diagnostic
  criteria in the ICD.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>More explicitly (emphasis my own):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Of 49 symptom categories identified, the following 10 fulfilled
  validity criteria: headache, fatigue, decreased energy/activeness,
  decreased alertness, drowsiness, decreased contentedness, depressed
  mood, difficulty concentrating, irritability, and foggy/not
  clearheaded. In addition, flu-like symptoms, nausea/vomiting, and
  muscle pain/stiffness were judged likely to represent valid symptom
  categories. In experimental studies, the incidence of headache was 50%
  and the incidence of clinically significant distress or functional
  impairment was 13%. Typically, onset of symptoms occurred 12–24 h
  after abstinence, with peak intensity at 20–51 h, and for a duration
  of 2–9 days. In general, the incidence or severity of symptoms
  increased with increases in daily dose; abstinence from <strong>doses as low
  as 100 mg/day produced symptoms</strong>. Research is reviewed indicating that
  expectancies are not a prime determinant of caffeine withdrawal and
  that avoidance of withdrawal symptoms plays a central role in habitual
  caffeine consumption.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As for health risks, beyond the symptoms of withdrawal, caffeine has been linked to a number of conditions, such as:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0895706102031552"">Aortic stiffness among hypertensions patients.</a></li>
<li><a href=""http://www.webmd.com/urinary-incontinence-oab/news/20100930/caffeine-and-bladder-problems-linked"">Incontinence among women</a></li>
<li><a href=""http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/186223/reload=0;jsessionid=CzWm7s65jDRhoHPFzX4K.10"">Insomnia</a></li>
<li><a href=""http://www.jstor.org/stable/3702680?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents"">Cardiac Arrest</a></li>
</ul>

<p>So to summarize: Yes, you can be addicted to caffeine. No, it is not a myth. And it seems like you need as little as 100mg a day to be addicted, that is the equivalent of 1.5 espresso shots, according to <a href=""http://www.caffeineinformer.com/caffeine-content/espresso"">this link.</a>. Prolonged caffeine use can be harmful, moderation is recommended.</p>

"<p>I'm a little surprised that you need to reduce temps on a 1200watt device. I had the opposite issue but similar techniques might help you. I looked at the system as having 3 basic variables: temperature, airflow, and volume of beans. Alter any one and you can achieve a different result. In my case I was unable to achieve high enough temps with my Air Crazy; particularly in cold weather since I roast outside. This is what I did:</p>

<p>1) Change the thermostat. I did it to increase temps but this is how I'd achieve a lower temp also. I switched the thermostat on my Air Crazy popper to increase the temp at which the element was turned off. If you pull it apart there is likely a thermostat on the chamber that opens the element circuit.  It should be marked in some way to indicate it's properties. Mine was riveted on. IIRC I bought a higher temp thermostat and also spaced it off the chamber a little. I used small stainless machine screws/nuts to reattach. </p>

<p>It's going to have 120v passing through it so make certain it is secure and the terminals are not contacting/energizing any other component like the actual roasting cup or popper case.  </p>

<p>If you do not have thermostat of some type in your element circuit (you almost certainly do) they are readily available online in a large range of temps. I believe mine opens at 210C now; I think it was 180c when I bought it. 210C is pretty hot and the whole popper gets rather hot but it works for me. You need one that resets, not a single use piece. </p>

<p>I think <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B008X0Y14A"" rel=""nofollow"">these</a> are what I used as I have 2 in my desk drawer right now.</p>

<p>In your case if you need to reduce the temps you may try thermal compound for CPU fans or a similar substance to increase conductivity and contact area at the thermostat, possibly turning off the element at a lower temp.  If not they clean up easily.</p>

<p>2)I altered the airflow also by closing some of the vents on the popping chamber, I've forgotten if I did this prior to upping the temps.  Same amount of air through fewer louvers resulted in higher velocities. Mine has louvers on the sides creating a swirling airflow to agitate the beans.</p>

<p>3)I added mass to the bottom of the popping chamber in an attempt to stabilize the overall temps. A few layers of heavy foil tape were enough.</p>

<p>4)I attached screens (actual window screen pieces) to intakes on bottom of it to stop the chaff from entering and burning on the element. I credit this for the 2 yr of usage I've gotten from this popper. Other elements have burnt open much faster. </p>

<p>5) I played with volume of beans to find max I could do without having uneven results. Too much and airflow was insufficient, too few beans seemed to greatly affect the quality. </p>

<p>In current practice I usually need to manually shake the popper every 20 sec or so up to first crack, from there the dried beans circulate well. I like very dark roasts so I also often restrict airflow somewhat later in the process by pressing the popper into a thick towel.  It is the easiest way I know to alter airflow (and thus temperature) on the fly. </p>

<p>This was several years ago so memory may be inaccurate. I'm not currently with the popper but can get it if you want more info or pics. I should buy another and better test these methods individually.</p>

"<p>The aeropress does not produce crema. There is no where near enough pressure using the aeropress to produce crema. Crema doesn't make coffee better, its typically a sign of good espresso, but isn't found in any other form of brewing nor is it what make the coffee actually taste better. French presses don't create crema either, and its a misleading yet common belief that they do.</p>

<p>The aeropress likely has about the same amount of oils as a pour-over cup of coffee if you're using the paper filters. The aeropress get it's richness from its style of brewing known as ""immersion brewing"". Longer contact with the grounds extracts compounds usually left behind by pour-over/drip methods. Combine with pressure, the aeropress, in short, just extracts more flavor by having a longer brew time and an environment which increases solubility with pressure.</p>

<p><strong>Clarification:</strong></p>

<p>The AeroPress has a short ""brew time"", however what I was meaning to say is that the aeropress and other immersion brewers have a longer contact time of the bean and the water. Therefore you have more extraction. The aeropress, unlike any other immersion method uses pressure to increase solubility. It's known that if you increase pressure that you extract quicker, and your solvent(water in this case) is able to achieve higher saturation.</p>

"<p>I did quite enjoy cardamom flavoured coffee. Currently I use <a href=""/questions/tagged/aeropress"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;aeropress&#39;"" rel=""tag"">aeropress</a> to brew coffee at home. Is there any way to add cardamom to the brewing routine?</p>
"
"<p><strong>You'll probably be able to get away simply with ground <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardamom"" rel=""nofollow"">cardamom/cardamon</a> added to the grounds</strong> when you're ""pre-infusing""/steeping the coffee grounds in the AeroPress. It's probably best to use <strong>very finely ground, freshly ground</strong> cardamom seeds. You may even wish to <strong>grind the cardamom seeds along with your coffee</strong> (i.e., in the grinder at the same time); you'll get similarly-fine grind. However, you might get a bit of cardamom flavour left over in the grinder; this may (not) be desirable.</p>

<p>As another option, you could also consider <strong>a sprinkle of the dry, ground spice into the cup after brewing.</strong></p>

<p>In addition to cardamom or <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_cardamom"" rel=""nofollow"">black cardamom</a>, one might also consider cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, allspice, anise, or other ""baking spices."" Any of these could be used in a similar way. For example, I sometimes use freshly grated nutmeg in the grounds when brewing pour-over, and it gives a nice smell and a hint of flavour in the cup.</p>

<p>You might also <strong>consider using an extract or essential oil</strong> or some high-intensity flavouring like that. You'd probably want to add that to your cup <em>after</em> brewing.</p>

<p><strong>I see a few problems that you might have to work around</strong>, specific to AeroPress, that you might run into with any of these spices. One problem you might encounter is the <em>rather short infusion time</em> commonly used in AeroPress; an option might be to try to <strong>steep the spice in the water as you're bringing it to the boil</strong>, but you risk burning the spice or otherwise contaminating the kettle (but might be worth a try to boil in a regular cooking pan). Another problem is that some spices have a rather strong hydrophobic tendency (specifically, cinnamon), so it might be necessary to stir the grounds more thoroughly than usual, to make sure the spices are infusing in the water. Also, these spices might leave behind some flavour in the AeroPress, so do consider washing thoroughly and soon after the brew. And you might get a hint of the spice next brew... so make sure it's something that you won't mind in the future!</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> More thoughts based on <a href=""http://coffee.stackexchange.com/q/2430/262"">a later question</a>: There's a few other suggestions from recipes like <a href=""http://www.kinfolk.com/recipe-cardamom-coffee/"" rel=""nofollow"">this</a> and <a href=""http://www.thekitchn.com/try-this-cardamom-coffee-180331"" rel=""nofollow"">this</a> (somewhat arbitrary top search hits).

"<p>Try this and see if there's any difference.</p>

<p>Pre-rinse the filter. Place the filter in the basket and run enough water over it to wet all of the filter, and then let most of the water drip off.</p>

<p>Since you are using a medium-dark roast, try using slightly colder water - like 180 F. This will help to not extract unwanted flavors from the dark roast.</p>

<p>When you go to brew the coffee, wet the grounds just enough so that there's hardly a drip through it. Let it sit for 30-60 seconds, then finish brewing.</p>

<p>If you're grinding it slightly more coarse, which I would recommend, then you'll need to increase your brew time. Try a 3 minute cycle.</p>

"<p>Whether or not the Aeropress creates an actual espresso crema is a subject of intense debate. What you certainly can get from an Aeropress is a tawny brown foam layer on top of your coffee. I think of my Aeropress brew as near-espresso rather than actual espresso or regular coffee.</p>

<p>To do this, I use a ceramic burr hand grinder (because I'm cheap) on one of the finest grind settings it will do. I use good whole bean coffee, and the cheap paper filters it came with. I heat water to around 175 degrees and only fill the water to just above the 1. I do wet the filter first and give it a little stir, but I only let it sit for a few seconds before pressing. I press <em>as hard as I can.</em> This goes against the Aerobie instructions but the more pressure, the more oils you get from the coffee grind (and the more tawny, creamy foam ends up on top). The very fine grind is critical here; you will not get the tawny foam from a coarse grind.</p>

<p><strong>I'd like to use the rotary grinder in such a way as <em>to make the ground coffee particle size as even as possible.</em></strong> Is this even possible? I find that, no matter how I use the thing, I end up with some very large chunks (even whole beans) and some extremely fine powder. The result is only usable in filter coffee (drip/pour-over), but it simply doesn't ""work"" as well as when the ground coffee particle size is more even.</p>

<p>I have searched for techniques or recommendations, but I find exactly <em>nothing</em> helpful on this, but I believe there must be <em>some way</em> to optimize the use of a rotary grinder. I have tried things like...</p>

<ul>
<li>Pulsing the machine. Turning on for a second, then letting the blades come to rest, then pulsing some more, until I achieve approximately the grind I'm looking for;</li>
<li>Shaking the grinder up and down during the grinding;</li>
<li>Revolving the grinder around in a circle the opposite way that the blades are spinning;</li>
<li>Using more or less beans in a single grinding session (""half full"" seems to work best for me)</li>
</ul>

<p>All of these seem to have minimal / marginal benefit. <strong>Is there any way to improve the coffee bean grind consistency using a rotary grinder?</strong></p>
"
"<p>""Using more or less beans in a single grinding session"" will yield the most bang for buck, usually.  However, this is highly dependent on your particular rotary grinder.  Rotary grinders are like miniature blenders.  Just like in a full size blender trying to make a milkshake or something, if you over- or under-fill the blender, then the blade won't be able to mix the ingredients as it cuts through them.  Cheap grinders won't be designed to mix very well as they grind, so with terrible grinders, you probably won't see much benefit to your strides.</p>

<p>You need to experiment with your particular blade-style rotary grinder to see how much you can add without prohibiting movement once the beans are fully chopped up, and without leaving too much movement where they just bounce around inside.  Too much room will create friction from the grinder chamber sides, and will start to warm up the coffee oils.  Too little room will result in the same bean being over-ground (too much friction from the blade), and you'll get coffee paste in the inner center of the grinder chamber.</p>

<p>Achieving consistency and repeatability to the level of a fast-food chain will be impossible, as rotary grinders are way to sensitive to how many beans you put in, as well as size and shape of the bean, how hard the bean is (age of bean), lunar phase, etc.  Maybe this is why all the big coffee chains use more expensive burr grinders in-store (not that the coffee is better, which it arguably is, its just more predictable).  Some fancy rotary grinders have timers and knobs and levers to set so you don't have to count to yourself before you let go of the grind-button.  That helps, but is far from a silver bullet.</p>

"<p>This <a href=""http://www.bced.gov.bc.ca/health/caffeine.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">paper</a> from the BC government states that 3 chocolate covered coffee beans have 36mg of caffeine. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is difficult to arrive at a recommended ordinary consumption
  quantity, or a standard “dose,” since caffeine is present in various
  consumer goods at widely differing levels. Some sources suggest that
  one-hundred milligrams, whether delivered into the bloodstream by
  liquid or solid, is useful as a base-line single dosage.[18] Though
  caffeine content can differ markedly even within a product category,
  (for example, the amount of caffeine present in “real-world coffee”
  can range from seventy-five to two-hundred-fifty milligrams per
  serving), the rough quantity of caffeine in the most commonly ingested
  products is well known.[19]</p>
  
  <p>A standard six ounce cup of drip-brewed coffee contains roughly
  one-hundred milligrams of caffeine, whereas a similarly sized cup of
  brewed tea contains roughly seventy milligrams.[20] Espresso, a common
  ingredient in many of today’s popular specialty coffee drinks,
  contains closer to one-hundred milligrams of caffeine per liquid
  ounce.[21] A conventional twelve ounce can of soda contains
  approximately fifty milligrams of caffeine, though specialty sodas
  such as “Jolt Cola” contain closer to seventy milligrams.[22] Milk
  chocolate contains roughly six milligrams of caffeine per ounce.[23]
  In the most common over-the-counter drugs, “Anacin” and “Excedrin”
  tablets contain thirty-two milligrams of caffeine each, while
  “Vivarin” contains two-hundred milligrams per tablet.[24]</p>
  
  <p>More noteworthy than the specific quantity of caffeine in conventional
  consumer products is the quantity of each product ingested on a daily
  basis. While the customary six ounce cup of coffee may contain
  one-hundred milligrams of caffeine, the ordinary serving sizes of
  “Starbucks” coffees are twelve, sixteen, and twenty ounces each.[25]
  More than half of all adult Americans “drink an average of three and a
  half cups of coffee a day, in addition to tea, cola, chocolate and
  over-the-counter caffeine-containing drugs.”[26] If potential problems
  with adult caffeine consumption are an issue to be considered, the
  caffeine intake of children is even more important, because “the
  potency of caffeine on a human body depends on the body’s weight.”[27]
  Some sources suggest that “[t]he highest exposure to caffeine from
  soft drinks on a mg/ kg / day basis is among young children,”
  especially children under the age of six.[28]</p>

"<p>Weight per bean ca 130mg <a href=""http://www.quora.com/What-is-average-weight-of-one-coffee-bean-in-grams"" rel=""nofollow"">from here</a>
One needs approx. 15g coffee per 250ml water, corresponding to 115beans per cup.
A 237ml serving of coffee contains 95mg caffeine (USDA), which would be 830ug / bean (I've read other sources saying about 1mg/bean). Note that this is extracted values, whole beans can contain as much as 7mg <a href=""http://www.caffeineinformer.com/caffeine-content/coffee-beans"" rel=""nofollow"">see here</a>
In your 145g bag, let's say 2/3 of the weight, e.g. 100g, is coffee beans, which corresponds to 770 beans, which would be 640mg to 5.2g(!) of caffeine.
<strong>However</strong> it's not clear how much extraction occurs the human digestion system at body temperature, especially as you will not chew the beans as finely as a coffee grinder.</p>

"<p>I am currently using a Baratza Encore grinder with my Saeco Aroma espresso machine.  I know that neither of these are very high quality products, but I really don't have the budget to upgrade.  The Encore is able to grind sufficiently fine and I have been quite happy with it, however, I get a lot of clumping when grinding for espresso.  It can be difficult to evenly distribute the coffee when you get these clumps, so it would be nice if there was an easy way to avoid this.  Anyone have any suggestions?  I've heard people say that a doser can solve this problem as the rotating sections will break up the clumps.  This is a nice solution, but I don't believe the encore is capable of being upgraded to have a doser.</p>

(plus it allows me to get around my lack of a proper Cezve) </p>

"<p>I recently bought some Kenyan SL28, SL34 beans with a supposed blackcurrant note. It has an overwhelming burnt rubber flavor that I thought was exclusive to Robusta, how come?</p>
"
"<p>I wouldn't go so far as to say that it's not a very high-quality grinder, it does extremely well for the price. The clumping is an artifact of:</p>

<ul>
<li>Humidity</li>
<li>Heat from grinding</li>
<li>Type and roast of the bean</li>
</ul>

<p>Grinders that produce almost no heat while grinding, to the point that they do it reliably enough for it to be a listed feature cost <em>ten times</em> the amount that you paid for your grinder. Heat during grind isn't an indication of a low-quality grinder, rather, little to no heat is simply an indicator of a <em>very</em> high-quality grinder. There isn't much you can do about this other than purchase a manual burr grinder and grind by hand <em>very</em> gingerly, which takes lots of time.</p>

<p>Tamping alone should be sufficient to deal with any clumps (at approximately 15kg of force) - if it's not, then you want to take a very close look at the beans you're using, and the level of humidity they're exposed to in storage. Is your grinder normally close to anything that produces steam? Is your kitchen air really humid? Are the beans stored in air-tight containers? If you have clumps that tamping won't take care of, you probably have a moisture problem.</p>

<p>It can also be the bean, some roasts just <em>do not</em> do well for espresso, no matter how fine the grind or how dry the storage. </p>

<p>Both <a href=""http://www.lavazza.us/us/products/blends/espresso/qualita-oro/"">Lavazza</a> and <a href=""http://shop.illy.com/online/store/product_coffee-all-us_whole-bean-medium-roast_us"">Illy</a> produce a <em>very</em> pleasant medium arabica bean that should work very well in your grinder. They are <em>very</em> consistent in production, delicious, and should give you a good baseline to select other beans that would work similarly well. You <em>can</em> get beans that weren't specifically produced with espresso in mind to work, but it takes a bit of tinkering. I recommend the above beans very often to people just getting started because they're delicious and very easy to work with.</p>

<p>Anyway, try one of those, see what comes out of the grinder. If you're still getting clumps that don't immediately break down when you tamp (tap the portafilter on the sides a few times before you tamp to help this) you could try cleaning the grinder, changing how you store the beans, or looking at a de-humidifier in the area that you keep them. </p>

"<p>Robusta is very uncommon, because its thought of as undesirable. Arabica is a very broad generalization for beans. Generally the bean, before its roasted, is profiled by its subspecies(aka variety), region its grown, and how its processed(washed, pulped, dried, etc). From my experience the only thing that has imparted a burnt rubber taste is either from over or under extracting, or from buying a dark roast.</p>

<p>Just because a bean is Arabica doesn't ensure that it is going to ensure a certain flavor profile or certain quality. I'd say try adjusting your brewing parameters such as the grind size, brew time, and bean to water ratio. If that proves unsuccessful, then perhaps that coffee is darker than you prefer, or perhaps its a fluke.</p>

"<p>I'm helping organize a big 24-hour event and as a big coffee drinker, I got put in charge of the coffee.

"<p>I bought a bag of Guatemala/Colombia/Ethiopia blend after having single origin Peru beans (all Arabica), and was struck by the difference in bean size: Peruvian beans were almost twice larger than the beans in the blend.</p>

<p>Now I'm wondering whether the difference is conditioned by some environmental factors, or regional differences of the coffee plant, or the timing of harvesting. Of course, it can also be that any coffee plant anywhere produces beans of (significantly) different size, and then they are sorted into size-consistent batches (as per <a href=""http://www.thecoffeeguide.org/coffee-guide/coffee-quality/bean-size/"">this guide</a>, for instance).</p>

"<p>First thing to keep in mind is that taste varies from person, so you may try other beans/brews that have similar descriptions, so you can learn about your own taste perception.</p>

<p>That been said, would be nice to know your equipment, in order to help you more. If you are using an espresso machine, maybe is time to have it cleaned. Mine was dirty a while ago and any beans would taste like burnt rubber, even light roasted ones. If you are using some infusion method (inverted aeropress or french press), try reducing the brewing time.</p>
"
"<p>Your problem depends more on the shape of the data than the raw quantities. 900 cups in 24 hours is one cup every 40 seconds or so, which isn't so bad, however I doubt that's the distribution of actual orders!</p>

<p>I'm going to assume all of your 300 guests want to have a cup of coffee during a one-hour period. This works out as 5 coffees a minute, or one every 12 seconds.</p>

<p>I'm ignoring factors of manpower, cost etc., and focussing on coffee preparation only :-)</p>

<p>You can get 12-cup french press pots very easily, and probably larger ones. Assuming each one takes ~6 minutes to cycle (prepare, brew for 4 mins, serve, rinse), meaning you can serve 2 people a minute with one pot. 3 pots would allow you to serve 6 people a minute (amortised) and serve 300 people in an hour. A few more pots would make it very comfortable. Assuming you're grinding the coffee fresh, you'll get a far superior brew from this than perk coffee that's been sitting there for 20 minutes.</p>

<p>So serving people fast enough shouldn't be too hard, but boiling water fast enough might be, and for that you just need an <a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/IgVDG.jpg"">urn</a>, with which you can keep a large enough supply of boiling water to just fill up and go.</p>

"<p>There are a large variety of factors that can affect bean size.  Obviously growing conditions can vary, and there is often variation of size within a single crop.  Keep in mind coffee is an agricultural product.  No one blinks when a crop of apples or oranges has a great variety in sizes, but many people seem to prefer their coffee beans a more uniform size.  Most places accomplish this with sorting but it is artificial to some extent.</p>

<p>On the other hand, roast level is a controllable process that greatly affects bean size.  Beans expand and become less dense as they are roasted and lose moisture.

"<p>Even according to researchers who assert the existence of caffeine dependence, the statistical likelihood of dependence is between 9% and 30%. If you determine you are among those who suffer negative effects from coffee consumption, it might be wise to find a substitute for coffee.</p>

<p>Below is an abstract from an article, ""Is Coffee Addictive--A Review of the Literature,"" by S. Patel in the Journal of Drug and Alcohol Abuse (2006), vol. 32 (4),493-502, suggesting that ""addiction"" is too strong a term.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Abstract:
  The common-sense use of the term addiction is that regular consumption is irresistible and that it creates problems. Caffeine use does not fit this profile. Its intake does no harm to the individual or to society and its users are not compelled to consume it. Though cessation of regular use may result in symptoms such as headache and lethargy, these are easily and reliably reversed by ingestion of caffeine. Some have argued that continued caffeine use is an attempt to suppress low grade withdrawal symptoms such as sleepiness and lethargy. In some moderate users, this is possible; however, in experimental contexts, the phenomenon is too inconsistent to constitute a reliably valid syndrome.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The current article on point in <a href=""http://www.webmd.com/balance/caffeine-myths-and-facts#1"" rel=""nofollow"">WebMD</a> says that caffeine addiction is a myth, with ""some truth to it,"" concluding: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This one has some truth to it, depending on what you mean by ""addictive."" Caffeine is a stimulant to the central nervous system, and regular use of caffeine does cause mild physical dependence. But caffeine doesn't threaten your physical, social, or economic health the way addictive drugs do.   </p>
</blockquote>

<p>In a self-styled ""Fact Sheet"" published by the Johns Hopkins Behavioral Pharm. Res. Unit, <a href=""http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/psychiatry/research/bpru/docs/caffeine_dependence_fact_sheet.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a> based on several studies, the sheet describes responses to a phone survey in which between 9% and 30% (depending on the symptoms offered) of caffeine users admitted symptoms associated (by psychiatrists) with addiction. The sheet concludes that a ""clinically meaningful caffeine dependence syndrome does exist.""</p>

<p>It appears that experts may disagree, at least about wording, especially when the wording can have economic or legal consequences. </p>

<p>A thoughtful remark by Betty Kovacs, MS, RD, from the <a href=""http://www.medicinenet.com/caffeine/page3.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">Medicine.Net</a> article on this question: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I don't know if we need to classify caffeine as addictive or something that you can be dependent on. I think that we need to be educated about the pros and cons of it in our diets and be aware of how our own body reacts to it.  </p>

"<p>Well, with any type of grinder you will always have what are called ""fines."" A blade grinder will undoubtedly produce more, but if I were you I would grind your particle size as fine as you can go. That way your deviation between the particle sizes is closer together, and should be easier to extract everything more even. Even if you have to shorten extraction time, you should see a better cup in the end result.  </p>

"<p>Why do coffee shops provide sparkling water (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineral_water"" rel=""nofollow"">mineral water</a>) along with Espresso?</p>
"
"<p>Most people drink espresso not just because it is hot, strong and contains caffeine, but because it is very rich and flavorful. The water is intended to cleanse your palate before the first sip so that you can better enjoy the taste of the espresso.</p>
"
"<p>There is an alternative to the accepted answer. In many Middle Eastern countries water is served as a matter of course with espresso. In very hot weather, even people accustomed to the heat may forget to drink enough water. Coffee is a strong diuretic. The combination of heat and diuretic can actually be dangerous.  It would be pretty thoughtless to serve coffee under these circumstances without encouraging people to hydrate. </p>

"<p>As an indirect answer to your question, <strong>find a coffeeshop that sells packages of roasted, whole beans <em>with the roasting date marked on the package.</em></strong> It's a good indication such a coffeeshop will be <em>using fresh beans</em> and <em>grinding them at the moment of brewing.</em> These two factors are the most important indicators of freshness.</p>

<p><strong>Justification:</strong> One of the biggest factors in freshness is <strong>when the coffee was roasted</strong>. As stated in <a href=""http://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/6/why-is-it-not-recommended-to-drink-coffee-immediately-after-its-roasted"">an early question about freshness of coffee</a>, coffee is usually <strong>best when brewed in a narrow window: between a few days after roast and a couple weeks after roast</strong>. If you're looking for beans to brew yourself: As stated in <a href=""http://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/2067/ground-coffee-or-beans"">another question</a>, always <strong>buy whole beans and grind them yourself just before brewing.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Bonus:</strong> Even better, <strong>find such a coffeeshop affiliated with a local roaster.</strong> You'll have higher confidence that the beans haven't encountered extreme temperatures (or humidity or other environmental conditions) during transport that might hurt the beans.</p>
"
"<p>Green coffee (unroasted) can maintain quality for several years. It is after you roast the coffee that it starts to lose freshness and quality. (see the first answer to <a href=""http://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/123/when-does-coffee-go-off"">this SO</a> for data on loss of freshness after the roast) </p>

<p>So in order to find the ""freshest java""sic, find the places where they roast their own. Nowadays you can find small coffee shops that buy green beans and roast themselves, known as micro-roasters, in almost any mayor city. </p>

<p>(I know, by definition <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_wave_of_coffee"" rel=""nofollow"">micro-roaster</a> implies that they aren't a mayor coffee shop... but they do have the freshest java )</p>
"
"<p>The single biggest factor in the size of a coffee bean is the botanical variety of the plant. There is no amount of nutrition or growing conditions that can overcome the effect of genetics.  </p>

<p>In this picture from our garden at Coffea Diversa you can see two examples at the extreme. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>On one hand you have mokka, this variety has the smallest bean of all
coffee varieties. </p></li>
<li><p>On the other hand you have Maragogype, this variety has the largest
bean of all coffee varieties.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>There is no amount of fertilizer that you can give to a mokka grain to make it even come close to the size of a ripe Maragogype bean (and viceversa). </p>

<p>The difference in sizes between your blend and peruvian coffees are probably due to the botanical varieties of the beans. </p>

"<p>Coffee is generally quite healthy and soda is full of sugar. However people end up putting lots of sugar in their coffees. </p>

<p>How much sugar is needed before a cup of coffee is worse than soda?</p>
"
"<p>For my calculations I'll be using Coca Cola (which has 39 grams of sugar in a single can! (375ml))</p>

<p>For any amount of pure Coffee (no milk), you can put 39 grams of sugar or nearly 10 teaspoons of sugar, as Coffee has no sugar in it. 30ml is a standard espresso size so to be equivalent per ml of liquid you would need to put 3.1 grams of sugar which is less than a teaspoon.</p>

<p><strong>One teaspoon in an espresso makes it contain a higher percentage of sugar than coke</strong></p>

<p>For a 150 ml Cappuccino which is approximately 25 ml of coffee and 85 ml of milk, (<em>Note that in a Cappuccino a portion of the volume is made up by froth which is why 85+25&lt;150</em>). Approximately 4.5 grams of sugar is from the milk which means you can still add another 34.5 grams of sugar to be equivalent to a can of coke. And to be equivalent per volume (using 110ml as the volume since the froth doesn't count as it is essentially air) you would need to add an additional 7 grams of sugar (nearly two teaspoons).</p>

"<p>Cleansing the palate <em>for</em> the coffee is a good explanation. Yet there is another tradition of serving water with espresso or coffee, where the water is drunk <em>after</em> the coffee:</p>

<p>In <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viennese_coffee_house"" rel=""nofollow"">Viennese coffee houses</a> (a place where coffee has a long-standing tradition) many patrons will stay for some time as these cafes are not only a quick stopover for a sip of coffee, but a place to read the newspaper, interact with other patrons and generally spend some time. (There is even a genre of writing created in that special atmosphere). During that time, customers will likely order coffee first before switching to another drink like wine afterwards. The water served with the coffee is again used to cleanse the palate, so that the residual coffee flavour doesn't interfere with the enjoyment of the wine or other following beverage.</p>

<p>If you get served sparkling water, it might just reflect a local custom - in Austria and Germany <em>sparkling</em> would be the default when ordering or serving water, you'd have to specify that you want uncarbonated.</p>

"<p>I have recently seen leaves of the coffee plant for sale for the purpose of making <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_tea_leaves"">coffee leaf tea</a> and I'm curious. <strong>What does it taste like?</strong></p>

It also sounds like a way for coffee farms to make some ""off-season"" profit, which is probably a win for everyone.</p>

<p>But what I'm interested in is the <em>taste</em>. The Wikipedia article (linked above) says it tastes like ""green tea"" but that's extremely varied, and others (like the link below) describe it as ""sweet"" or ""refreshing"" or ""dry"" but none of those are particularly helpful either.</p>

<p>I have only seen <a href=""http://wizemonkey.com/shop/"">this one place selling the stuff</a> and they seem to be perpetually sold out, but maybe it's highly seasonal. </p>

<p>The leaves seem to be sold for $20 for 50g, or about $180/pound (since they're in Canada, I assume those are CAD/C$). Maybe it's like conventional tea, where even a gram goes far, but I don't know. Before I shell out that much, has anyone tried the stuff? <strong>What does it taste like?

"<p>Hi there fellow coffee lovers! So, I recently decided to purchase my first ever espresso machine (well, kind of)! Its a steam espresso machine made my Mr. Coffee®. I know its a beginner machine, so I plan on upgrading to a pump machine in the future. </p>

<p>So, it surprisingly makes pretty good espresso! It takes really pleasant, but its missing on major element of a good espresso shot: the crema!! I simply fill the portafilter with espresso ground coffee up to the appropriate level. It seems like I grind about 2 and a half tablespoons for two ounces of water. I then ""tamp"" the coffee down with a flat spoon. I put it into my machine, turn it on, and wait like a minute for the hot espresso to come out. It sort of gives something similar to crema, but it seems for just like foam, and it doesn't last very long either. </p>

<p>Is there a way to generate crema using a steam espresso machine, or is it really not possible? Am I doing something wrong? Any feedback is appreciated! Thanks!</p>
"
"<p>The sour taste may be related to the aeropress method. </p>

<p>From <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/37u3dx/do_all_coffees_taste_sour_when_brewed_in_an/"" rel=""nofollow"">this reddit</a> and this thread in <a href=""http://coffeegeek.com/forums/coffee/machines/564916"" rel=""nofollow"">CoffeGeek</a> it sounds like it may be related to under-extraction from either using water that is too cold, the grind is to coarse, brewing too fast, or using too much coffee. </p>

<p>Try adjusting your brewing process to improve the extraction. </p>
"
"<p>You are doing everything perfectly to spec. The problem is neither with your machine, nor with your use of it. It is with the nature of your expectation. Steam espresso machines simply do not produce the crema you are looking for. I would suggest adjusting your expectation to fit the current result, or adjusting the result to fit your expectation. Either buy a pump espresso machine, or make do with what you have.</p>
"
"<p>There are a few reasons why you might not get a good crema:</p>

<ul>
<li>Stale coffee</li>
<li>Coffee not ground fine enough</li>
<li>Pressure too low</li>
</ul>

<p>With a steam-powered espresso machine (especially if it's an entry level machine), you will typically not reach high enough pressure to get a proper crema. The crema is formed by oils extracted from the ground coffee, which needs high pressure (something like 9 bars). Your steam-powered machine will probably not produce more than ~3 bars of pressure.</p>

<p>Tamping with a spoon also seems not ideal, because it will be very difficult to achieve an even tamp. I cannot comment on how important that is for this particular machine, but with higher end pump machines it might lead to channeling and uneven extraction.</p>
"
"<p>Had once, made of dehidrated leaves. Lighter than green tea, it ressembles rucola (arugula, in the US).</p>
"
"<p>Actually, The reason the Keurig machines can brew tea so quickly is because both K-Cups and the My K-Cup add the element of pressure to the steeping equation. This pressure speeds extractions in ways low-pressure steeping does not, meaning the compounds in tea are extracted faster.</p>
"
"<p>Depends on how much coffee you consume, the frequency, the duration, as well as the potency of the caffeine..i do know from experience that my body is addicted to caffeine because i get severe headaches when i do not consume coffee (after having my usual dose of triple latte once a day for several months).  The good news is that the headache goes away after two weeks of no caffeine, and lots of ibuprofen. </p>
"
"<p>You should always grind your beans just before brewing. Also keep the beans in an airtight bag. When you grind the beans you increase the surface of your coffee beans which means the area in contact with air is increased. Oxygen is a very reactive molecule that takes part in the formation of peroxides and free fatty acids. Both of these result in an awful bitter taste. You would want to keep the area subjected to reactions with oxygen as small as possible for as long as possible :)</p>

"<p>At Starbucks I asked for venti with an extra shot. The barista called it a triple venti. What does the triple mean? I thought and a Google search confirmed that a venti comes with 3 espresso shots, so what does the triple refer to?</p>
"
"<p>Refers to those shots of espresso. You have 2 in there by default. (The <em>iced</em> Venti drinks typically get 3, because the cup is a little larger (24 oz.))</p>
"
"<p>Suppose I brew a 16 oz cup of coffee, take just one generous sip (one ounce), and then put the rest in the fridge.</p>

<p>Just how ""stale"" is my coffee, when I revisit it 24 hours later?</p>
"
"<p>The general idea is that tamping with moka pots is unnecessary/harmful/dangerous because of the excessive pressure this will cause (see Ivan's answer: <a href=""http://coffee.stackexchange.com/a/489"">http://coffee.stackexchange.com/a/489</a>). </p>

<p>However, we usually compact the ground coffee a bit with a spoon by slightly tapping on the grounds while making sure that there is a flat surface. This tends to give a richer flavour if, for whatever reason, you do not fill the basket to the top. (E.g. if you want to prepare a smaller serving and you don't have a smaller pot.) This is not traditional tamping, but somewhat similar.</p>

<p>My hypothesis is that the reason for the  improvement in flavor seems to be the longer extraction time: If the basket is only half full, I mostly tend to get underextracted, somewhat sour-ish coffee. Compacting the grounds a bit results in more resistance to the hot water and, thus, a longer contact time. (Not sure if that hypothesis is correct, but the result is easy to reproduce for me.)</p>
"
"<p>Caffeine does not break down (at any appreciable rate) when left alone in a drink. It requires the enzymes in your body to break it down, so when you take the drink out of the fridge, it'll be just as caffeinated as when you put it in.</p>

<p><strong><em>However</em></strong>, your drink will still be stale, because there are plenty of other organic compounds in the coffee that will break down over that time, affecting the taste. Also, assuming you reheat the coffee, the reheating will have further effects, making it taste very bitter.</p>

<p>Either make yourself a smaller coffee (16oz is a lot!) or drink it all when it's fresh.</p>

"<p>In our office we have a bean-to-cup machine. The rate at which we use it means we always have fresh beans - generally it tastes pretty good for machine-made coffee.

Is there any potential remedy for this other than throwing away the first few coffees?</p>
"
"<p>Bean-to-cup machines are automatic coffee machines that grind beans for each individual cup.</p>

<p>The user usually only has to fill the machine up with beans and water, and press a button for a particular type of coffee. Some machines also incorporate automatic milk frothers for making white coffees.</p>
"
Bean-to-cup machines are automatic coffee machines that grind beans for each individual cup.
"<p>My thought is that once you turn on the machine, the machine starts to heat the water. Often the heating system is regulated by a PID regulation (Maybe on-off regulation). The machine will heat the water fast to make sure you can get your cup of coffee:) Once the water is heated it will stabilize to the intended temperature. If the water is heated above the intended temperature it will cause acidic compounds to be extracted from the beans. After a while the temperature is stabilized and you will experience that the coffee is no longer acidic. </p>

<p>Another theory is that the pipes within the machine are not clean. </p>

<p>You can test both. </p>

<p>Try turning on the machine an hour before making the first cup. If this helps it is probably a temperature issue.</p>

<p>If not try to clean the machine by running through hot water before making the first cup. </p>

<p>Hope one of these solutions will help you with your issue.</p>

"<p>By volume? Serving? I feel either way, the answer is easily reached by anyone with a basic education and reading some nutrition facts.</p>

<p>You could make a simple ratio:</p>

<p><em>x</em> Soda has 24g of sugar, how much is 24g in volume(teaspoons)? Every roughly 4 grams of sugar is equal to a teaspoon which is 6 teaspoons, or 2 tablespoons. So a 12.6803(372ml) can has 6 teaspoons of sugar in it, so every roughly half ounce has a teaspoon of sugar.</p>

<p>So remember, every ounce is 2 teaspoons of sugar. Next time you buy a 24oz latte you'd have to add 48 teaspoons of sugar. What easy math! Just double it.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> I did not use coke as my example. If you want to use coke as your base value, the math is pretty basic.</p>

"<p>I find drinking coffee relaxes me. Given that caffeine is a stimulant, I would expect it to do the opposite. Why? is it psychological? does it have something to do with it being a hot beverage? is it an effect of the caffeine? </p>
"
"<p>Coffee has <a href=""http://www.coffeechemistry.com/"">many compounds beyond</a> caffeine. There are  trigonelline, proteins, carbohidrates, quinic acid, caffeic acid etc... So the chemical mix in your cup is a little more complex than just a caffeine shot. All of these chemicals are going to stimulate your sense of taste, and this effect may be relaxing, even if they are latter followed by a caffeine high. </p>

<p>On the other hand you have some effects in your physiology that come from drinking a hot beverage, even if it is <a href=""http://www.buzzle.com/articles/hot-water-benefits.html"">only hot water</a>, the temperature change would produce an effect in your body that can be perceived. </p>

<p>Your psychology may also be playing a role here, if you associate drinking your cup of coffee with a relaxing situation it may help you relax at a psyc level. </p>

"<p><strong>Baking soda.</strong> I use a standard dish sponge/scrubbie with baking soda and a little water and it comes completely out. I've actually tried it with just a damp paper towel and baking soda and it's almost as easy.</p>

<p>Baking soda has natural whitening properties and is a very gentle abrasive. I actually started using it elsewhere (sinks, counter tops, greasy pans) before discovering its use in coffee cups.</p>

<p>I've also tried baking soda + salt on counter tops and pans with great success. Salt has similar whitening properties (surprisingly to me) and is a stronger abrasive.

"<p>Probably closest to an espresso is an <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AeroPress"">AeroPress</a>, which is similar to a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_press"">French press</a>, but uses manual pressure to extract more aromatic componds while being lower on bitter and sour notes than most other methods. </p>

"<p>From what I could find, blade grinder is no match to burr grinder, no matter what technique or special shaking/tilting way you use. 
When I use blade grinder - I find pulsing helps.  Pulse for couple of times, look at the result. Pulse couple more times... and so on, until you are (sort of) satisfied with the result. </p>

<p>If you really want to get creative, you could pulse for some time, shake the grinder. That will bring the roughest parts to the top.  Remove them into one container.  If the rest is ok - put that into french press (or w/e way you make your coffee). Put the undergrinded part back and repeat.  That may or may not prove worthy of your time, but it is an idea that crossed my mind, when I used rotary (blade) grinder. </p>
"
"<p>Many factors are at play here. 
I assume we are talking about morning coffee and not about something that helps to pull you through the night of studying.
So, the easiest (minimal amount of work in the morning) would be a drip coffee.  Definitely an upgrade from instant.  Many of machines allow you to preset the wake up time, so that you prepare everything at night, and then you wake in the morning to a ready cup (or two) of coffee waiting for you.</p>

<p>If you actually care about taste and want something that won't just give you a kick in the head, but actually be a pleasurable experience - buy real whole bean coffee, and grind it yourself.  </p>

<p>As to a way to make coffee - that is a purely opinion based question. Some people love espresso. I like my french press.  Some love their morning cappuccino, etc.  You have to experiment and find your drink of choice. 
But the first best thing you can do, is to buy a whole bean coffee and grind it yourself.  The taste difference (specially after an instant coffee) will be enormous!</p>

"<p>I am using Philips HD 7450/20 6 Cups Coffee Maker . Recently After every cycle I find that some coffee(brewed) is still left in the filter part. I tried cleaning the equipment using vinegar.</p>

<p>Can someone suggest how to resolve this.</p>

"<p>I've read on different websites, mainly fitness related, about cycling a pre-workout due to a build up of caffeine tolerance. 
The suggestions generally range in 1-2 weeks, but I think this would be a great question to have here.  Some links would be nice, if you could point me to some studies.</p>

<p>So, How long does it take to reset caffeine tolerance to pre-caffeine levels? </p>

<p>Can lowering down caffeine for a period of time work as a partial caffeine tolerance recalibrator? </p>
"
"<p>If you are looking at cycling your caffeine naivety with an eye for fitness  benefit (caffeine increases exercise tolerance), I think you should first look into whether there is any true benefit to the cycling.  You are talking about purposefully inducing a cycle of addiction/dependence and withdrawal, however, I am not sure I have ever heard that the exercise tolerance from caffeine decreases as caffeine tolerance increases.</p>

<p>In cycling (a sport I am familiar with) most pros maintain some level of caffeine tolerance.  I've the routine before the day's workout is an espresso or two.  I've never heard of cycling that caffeine intake.  With a doping and performance maximization such a ever present in cycling, it seems like if there was really benefit to cycling, it would be happening.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.livescience.com/5374-coffee-lessens-pain-exercise.html"" rel=""nofollow"">This article</a> suggests that the exercise tolerance is the same or similar regardless of the level of caffeine dependence. (<a href=""http://users.clas.ufl.edu/msscha/premed/caffeine_musclepain.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">actual study here</a>) The most I could find online for cycling was some bodybuilding forums talking about cycling their pre-workout stimulants.  Not really any specific information about what is contained in the mess of supplements they are taking. </p>

<p>Based on that study and the lack of information for cycling caffeine tolerance, I'd suggest that the withdrawal symptoms and side effects of caffeine consumption on naive individuals are not worth the purported but undocumented benefit of cycling your caffeine consumption.  I think while it's true that some of the mental stimulation and other effects of caffeine may taper off with tolerance, the exercise tolerance benefit does not.  However, individuals ignorant of this, or seeking mainly the mental stimulant part of caffeine effects, may resort to cycling their caffeine intake.  </p>

<p>TL;DR The bottom line is for physical performance, there is not a reason to cycle.  For mental performance there is a build up of tolerance and off periods would provide a benefit at the cost of symptoms encountered during the withdrawal period.</p>

"<p>Somewhere I read that coffee contains carcinogens unless it's filtered, and I think I've noticed that such filtered coffee seems to be weaker. I let it stay for about 5-10min, and it still tastes weaker than coffee made without a coffee filter (paper one of course).</p>

<p>So my question is, how is a filtered coffee different from unfiltered coffee, assuming we're using a paper filter? Mainly I'm looking for a scientific explanation.</p>
"
"<p>There's two points to address.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>""Weaker"" coffee with paper filters as compared to brewing right in the cup. As far as I understand (although I can't find citation), paper filter does not capture caffeine or aromatic compounds very much. The feeling that filtered coffee is thinner may in your case come from less microgrounds floating in the cup (i.e., from mechanical, rather than chemical, sensation).</p></li>
<li><p>I'm not sure what you meant by carcinogenic properties, but you may want to read about <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cafestol"" rel=""nofollow"">cafestol</a> and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kahweol"" rel=""nofollow"">kahweol</a>, two diterpines that are supposed to have <strong>anti</strong>-carcinogenic effect. They are also said to raise cholesterol levels (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9351383"" rel=""nofollow"">this study</a>). They are removed by paper filters, and if you want to go into details of its levels in various preparations, see <a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0963996912002360"" rel=""nofollow"">this article</a>. It reports that cafestol is lower in darker roasts, and among the non-filtering methods is highest in swedish boiled coffee and lowest in moka pot (""stovetop espresso"").</p></li>

"<p>i bought this blend luwak too in indonesia, being tried various luwak's,  i must say that this is very good coffee ( the word blend means it is mixed with arabica coffee and luwaks to give the good taste  ). if it is 100% luwak then they will write 100% . by the way 100% luwak coffee doesn't taste good, in fact no single origin coffee taste as good as a blended one be it java, columbia or brazil </p>

<p>this blend is perfect mixture and it have the distinctive smell and taste of luwak poop which means it is original. don't worry </p>

"<p>if you're keen to experiment i'd look at homebrew(beer) stores. i'd try chocolate/black or coffee/brown barley malt(both pure barley names refer to roast) i don't live in the US but you should be able to buy for around a couple of $/lb. you also try mixing with crystal rye, smoked malt, peatted malt or anything interesting you can find. i'd also ask them to mill the grain fine as possible.
i'd be interested to see how it turns out</p>
"
"<p>If you want stronger coffee (referring specifically to the amount of total dissolved solids), then you really just need a stronger coffee to water ratio. Or just simply add more coffee. 
Although what I think you are really experiencing is a difference in mouth feel. Using a paper filter with certainly give the coffee clarity. Really fine paper filters (like a chemex filter - being thick and made from soft woods) will evidently filter out very small particles - which results in a very delicate, crisp, and light mouth feel tasting cup of coffee. On the opposite end of the spectrum you have the french press. Which you end up having tiny fine particles left in your end cup, which gives a great amount of body, and a very heavy mouth feel. Both are totally fine cups of coffee, but are totally subjective to your palate. </p>

<p>The thing about extraction is that you really only want to extract about 20% of the coffee you have. If you look at an extraction versus time graphed out, you can see that it represents the curve y=sqrt(x), where extraction continues to increase as time goes on, but at a slower and slower rate. All this means is that by simply letting your coffee brew longer, you are not exactly going to make it any stronger past a certain point. You simply just need to add more coffee. As for the filter - your over all brew strength, or total dissolved solids - should basically be the exact same compared to if you didn't filter it with paper. The main difference is how it's being presented to your mouth. <a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/PSquf.png"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/PSquf.png"" alt=""Extraction versus Time graph""></a></p>

<p>I think a good starting place is a 1:16 ratio, meaning 1 parts coffee to 16 parts water. Depending on how that taste to you, just manipulate it until desired. Hopefully this helps out! </p>
"
"<p>From what your question seems to be asking - I believe that grinding your coffee more coarse is all that needs to be done. Water will drain quicker through more coarsely ground coffee, and it seems like all the fine particles are eventually clogging the bottom of the cone. </p>
"
"<p>I'm not sure about that stuff, but they make a tea that is derived from the fruit that the coffee seed is taken from called Cascara. It's actually quite delicious and often is reminiscent of a sweet dried cranberry. I would certainly check it out, but otherwise the leaves by them self sound a bit over priced. </p>

"<p>Tried oatmilk yesterday at home as a milk substitute in my lattés and it was delicious. I used an organic brand with zero other things in it and it frothed up almost identically to normal milk (i use the nespresso latte frother). I used it with decaf and it tasted great - i actually prefered it to milk and my usual latte (the milk slime that coats the glass afterwards, anyone? - gone!) I am definitely hooked. :-)</p>

"<p>I recently switched from a Bialetti Moka Express 3-cup stovetop espresso maker to a <a href=""https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=de&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cloer.de%2Fdruckversion.php%3Fuid%3D0%26id%3D19833"" rel=""nofollow"">Cloer 5928</a> espresso maker. It has an integrated heating unit, just like an electric kettle, so making a coffee is now much more energy-efficient.</p>

<p>The coffee from the Bialetti was flawless (using a medium-fine grind of Starbucks espresso roast beans). Now I have a difficult time producing coffee that is not both overly thin (underextracted) and has an odd taste that I can't even describe (perhaps from overheating the ground coffee?). </p>

<p>The new espresso maker takes some time to heat up (365 Watts of electric power), and then the coffee is pressed through relatively quickly in short bursts. </p>

<p>Having a look at the funnel, it has a hole, unlike the funnel of the Bialetti. My questions are:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Can the hole in the funnel have anything to do with the underextracted coffee?</strong></li>
<li><strong>What could be the purpose of the hole anyway?</strong></li>

"<p>Another possibility for residual stains: Try soaking in <strong>powdered dishwasher detergent</strong> (i.e., stuff for automatic dish machines, not dish soap) and <strong>boiling water</strong>.</p>

<p>The process: put a small amount (~ 1 tsp / 5 mL) of powdered dishwasher detergent in the cup. Fill cup with <em>boiling</em> water (very hot tap water might also be okay).

"<p>A couple of questions/answers on this site make it clear that many people feel that coffee is addictive, at least for some fraction of consumers. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My question, for those who believe coffee is addictive, is whether and how it should be regulated? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am leaving the notion of ""regulated"" open. It could mean banning sales of coffee to minors, collecting a surtax to fund treatment, printing warnings on containers, and so on. </p>

<p>Given the emerging addiction-lore on the web I think it would be naive to assume that coffee would never be regulated. So I am interested in the extent to which people entertain or support regulatory ideas we currently associate with more potent drugs.</p>

<p>If one really believes that coffee is harmful and addictive, wouldn't one at least support a warning label on cups? Restricted sales to minors? The dangers listed in <a href=""http://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/2127/will-i-be-addicted-to-caffeine"">this</a> well-received answer, if one accepts them, seem to commend at least mild warnings.   </p>

<p>Edited 11/13 to link earlier question/answer. </p>
"
"<p>One thing is clear is that caffeine is addictive there are withdrawals when it is cut abruptly from the diet; however, in saying that coffee itself should not be regulated. Regulation on coffee would be like regulating tea, a drink that has been used for thousands of years will no ill effects. In the US coffee is the number one source of antioxidants therefore being a positive force for national health.   </p>
"
"<p>Generally, governments find it necessary to regulate addictive substances due to quality of life or health issues that stem from abuse/addiction. While I will neither support or attack this kind of reasoning, when you think about children born addicted to heroin or methamphetamine, the property crimes generally associated with addiction, and the additional strain on our health care system, you can begin to at least understand it.  </p>

<p>Coffee addiction is far less financially taxing (my dependence costs me roughly $10/week or less), less likely to disturb my health in any appreciable way, and socially acceptable at all levels of society.  </p>

<p>The coffee industry generates plenty of revenue for government as is.  Starbucks is paying their taxes just like every other corporation.  Creating an additional branch of government employees to regulate or adding additional employees to an existing administration (FDA perhaps?) are all expenses to regulate something that isn't currently a problem.  So it's an expense without any appreciable benefit. </p>

<p>TL;DR  Since coffee is a low impact and highly supportable dependence, government has little or nothing to gain by regulating it's use.     </p>

"<p>What is the ""standard"" name for this type of coffee in the various countries (I mean made from these type of machines with the paper filter)?</p>

<p>I have noticed when travelling that in some coffee spots in various countries in Europe, this type of coffee is not available. Unless it has a different naming than I am aware.<br>
Is this called American coffee? Because I know that Americano is a type of espresso so it is not the same</p>
"
"<p>The drip-type coffee is available in many countries in Europe. A list of names:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Filterkaffee</em> in Germany / Austria / Switzerland </li>
<li><em>filterkaffe</em> in Denmark and Sweden</li>
<li><em>filterkoffie</em> in the Netherlands</li>
<li><em>kawa filtrowana</em> in Poland</li>
<li><em>café filtre</em> in France / Switzerland / Belgium</li>
<li><em>café filtro</em> in Spain</li>
<li><em>caffè preperato con il filtro</em> in Italy / Switzerland</li>
</ul>

<p>Can you see a pattern here: Always a combination of <em>coffee</em> and <em>filter/filtered</em>. The terms are so closely related that if you order ""<em>filtered coffee</em>"" an attentive waiter should be able to help you even if you don't know the precise term at your destination.</p>

<p>Note that if you order ""coffee"" <em>without specifying the preparation</em>, you will be served the local ""default"". This will actually be filtered coffee in many countries of Northern and Central Europe, in Italy, as counter-example, you will get what you'd call ""espresso"", likewise in Spain or Portugal: small, strong. </p>

<p>Asking for <em>caffè americano</em> will <em>perhaps</em> get you an espresso diluted with hot water in some places in Italy (sources vary whether it's a remenant from WW II or started with international tourism), sometimes <em>caffè all'americana</em> (""coffee American-style"") will get you drip coffee. Likewise in touristy areas of Spain, <em>café americano</em> might get you a diluted coffee.</p>

<p>Further north you won't be understood. They will probably direct you to the nearest Starbucks.</p>

"<p>I know this doesn't answer the question, but since it's already been answered...</p>

<p>My boss recently got back from a two-week trip to Italy, where he was unable to order a drink by the name of ""Americano."" And if they don't know what you're talking about, which was his case, they hand you an espresso.</p>

<p>So it seems that an Americano, regardless of how the name originated, is now an American drink. Not to say that you couldn't order this anywhere in Italy, but just that it was not the norm in the cafes my boss went to.</p>
"
"<p>I would recommend looking for which coarse setting seems to produce the most even grind. Really, the only potential danger you have is grinding so fine that you can't push the screen down.</p>

<p>The reason I recommend this is, like you mentioned, because everything else can be altered to your coffee's grind - the water temperature and extraction time. So you'll want to dial in a grind that's going to be evenly extracted. If your most coarse setting gives you big chunks and a lot of fine particles as well, then you're either going to over extract the fine and under extract the coarse, or vice versa depending on your brew time.</p>

<p>I hesitate to give you a dogmatic answer because I don't want to mislead you, but I also understand that it takes time to recognize even grinding and the grind size that is appropriate for the brew method. So I'll say that somewhere around medium to medium-coarse is going to be better. With smaller burr grinders, the coarsest setting has pretty uneven results.</p>

<p>Also, try playing with the extraction time. Start with two minutes, then try 3, on up to 5. If you keep everything consistent, you should be able to find exactly what works/tastes best for your situation.</p>
"
"<p>Just guessing here, but the hole could keep the water from going up until it reaches a certain temperature. The amount of pressure from the steam varies on the temperature of the water, and if there weren't enough pressure, the water would recycle. However, if the pressure were greater, the velocity of the water would prevent it from dripping out of the hole.</p>

<p>This could explain the bursts, since the pressure would rise and fall depending on the amount of water it pushed out. The more water that escapes, the more room there is left behind for pressure to fill.</p>

<p>Also, you mentioned a weird taste. Could it be metallic? If so, you could try letting the base sit in a strong coffee/water mixture for a couple days. The moka pot needs to be seasoned to prevent this taste, so I would recommend not washing it with soap - just rinse. My grandmother has never washed hers.</p>
"
"<p>I think the Gaggia Descaler would work fine in any espresso machine. Just use the same procedure and amount that worked for the Gaggia machine (or use the directions for The Oracle). </p>

<p>I have never bothered to buy any commercial descaler, since they seem overpriced to me. I buy pure citric acid powder over the internet, and use that for both a Gaggia Classic and a Ponte Vecchio Lusso.</p>

"<p>Has anyone had any luck making peanut butter flavoured coffee?  If so, what process did you use?</p>
"
"<p>I would be opposed to any form of restrictive regulation. In truth I'm not in favour of it for most drugs anyway as I am all for personal freedoms. Except in the case of cigarettes, where public use of the product directly and negatively impacts on others.  </p>

<p>However, I can see no harm to labeling warnings. Anything that promotes knowledge amongst consumers is a positive, in my view.</p>

<p>The argument that the societal ills of other illegal drugs (such as associated property crime and violence) seems to me inconsistent. The crime occurs with those drugs precisely because they are illegal and restricted, so the costs are able to inflate.  Naturally it is more complicated than that and there is a difference of degree with addiction to consider. I merely point out the need to be cautious in making parallels with illegal drugs.</p>
"
"<p>I heard from Dr. Karl, an Australian radio science presenter, that some studies have suggested that caffeine doesn't actually keep you awake at all.  The connection is that the caffeine only relieves the craving for caffeine, and it was the craving that was making you feel artificially groggy or lousy.</p>

<p>This would seem to only apply to regular drinkers of course, and anecdotally there seems a wealth of testimony that says caffeine makes it harder for people to sleep.  </p>
"
"<p>I've been thinking about this for a while, and was wondering if it was safe.</p>

<p>Nowadays, we're sometimes ina big rush and there's not enough time.  Can I simply drop a spoonful of my favorite cheap coffee, i.e Maxwell, in a cup of water (should be boiled ) ; and then get started with my day?</p>

<p><a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/0GNU4.gif"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/0GNU4.gif"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>I realize they make instant coffee, but which is  slightly more pricy. Also, I feel that instant coffee has a somewhat artificial taste.</p>

<p>I am wondering about the safety askpect of this though. Is there any harm possible by ingesting some raw coffee grounds?</p>
"
"<p>It boils down to taste - some people even chew whole beans. </p>

<p>Safety-wise there are no concerns<sup>1</sup> and the method you propose is not unheard of, it goes by the term ""Cowboy coffee"" and others. Some preparation methods even quickly boil the grounds and water (Turkish coffee), other sources warn against pouring boiling water over your grounds and suggest letting the water cool a few degrees first.</p>

<p>It is up to you to decide whether you like the grainy residue you might taste if you don't let the grounds settle enough before drinking.</p>

<p>So, go ahead and do a taste test. You can always pour your coffee through a sieve or use the leftovers for drip coffee. </p>

<hr>

<p><sup>1</sup> There is some discussion whether the slightly higher content of coffee oils compared to filtered matters healthwise, but that's a very vague subject, IMHO. Other brewing methods bring more oils as well.</p>
"
"<p>There are absolutely no safety problems here. </p>

<p>For reference, what you are describing actually was THE method of brewing coffee before the invention of filters! (See for example <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_preparation#Brewing"" rel=""nofollow"">the wikipedia article, especially the part about ""Boiling""</a>.)</p>

<p>Also this is basically equivalent to a preparation with the french press, with the only difference being that gravity moves the coffee grounds to the bottom instead of a filter/mesh.</p>

<p>The only disadvantages might be that you likely will have some coffee grounds in the last sip(s), which is why they are often discarded with that preparation method. And obviously, you can't easily stop the brewing process, which might or might not lead to a worse taste (I don't have experience with that).  </p>
"
"<p>Seems like a bad way to start a day to me. This method will over brew the coffee and give it a gritty texture (especially at the bottom) but as the other poster have mentioned it really just boils down to taste. Experimentation is the only way to find out what you like.</p>

<p>To what I think is the deeper point of the question. How can I drink coffee without time to prepare it? Many people use a coffee maker and with a timer. If you prepare the machine the night before it would actually take less time in the morning then your proposed method. </p>

<p>Also consider structuring you morning differently. You could use a french press or coffee sock, and perform a morning task like brushing your teeth and washing your face while the coffee steeps for 3-4 mins. Then you could remove the grounds and eliminate the over brewing and grittiness issues.</p>
"
"<p>I have recently started enjoying cold brew (over ice) in the afternoons. In the morning I still like by coffee hot. Is their a preferred or recommended method for heating? What factors should I take into account. I have tried adding hot water, but it makes the coffee too weak before I am able to get the temperature up where i want. Microwaving seems to negatively affect the taste.</p>
"
"<p>The quickest and easiest foolproof way to make decent coffee is to get a dirt cheap percolator for drip coffee. French presses are fine too but are a bit more work and if the grind is irregular or too fine you can get a mouthful of coffee grounds in your cup.</p>

<p>You can ensure good flavour by regularly (e.g. two-weekly) buying freshly ground beans.</p>

<p>The next step up would be to grind your own beans, even better if you can get the beans freshly roasted from a good local coffee roaster (try their products if you can, some may suck but good roasters produce wonderful freshly roasted beans with lots of aroma).</p>

<p>You should try espresso based coffee for a bit before you consider buying an espresso machine. A good espresso machine is very quick and easy to use once it has come up to temperature, cheaper machines require a little more work if you want to steam milk but are just as easy for espresso shots. I've got quite a fancy machine but I think that the majority of the flavour is made by the coffee, a good machine just makes the process easier.</p>
"
"<p>Espresso is from Italy, and sparkling water is very popular there, which is probably why it is so common to see sparkling water (as opposed to still) even here with coffee.</p>

<p>The reasons given above for serving water with espresso seem good. In addition, I find espresso on its own can be a bit dehydrating so I always drink it with cold water on the side in the summer.</p>
"
"<p>The best result I got was warming up in a <a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bain-marie"" rel=""nofollow"">bain-marie</a>. No science here---just my trials... I believe for now that bain-marie preserves more flavours and ""respects"" the aromas.</p>

<hr>

<p>Heating cold-brew coffee was surprising to me the first time. Such unexplored flavours with the exact same beans I use for drip, etc. I hope you'll enjoy, and explore for more questions here!</p>
"
"<p>I heard this a while back, the milk binds with the antioxidant molecules of the coffee and renders them useless. A quick Google seems to suggest that this isn't true but the study which concluded this was conducted by Nestle so was no doubt biased. </p>

<p>A follow up question would be, if you drink black coffee and have cereal for breakfast does that pretty much count as putting milk in your coffee too?</p>
"
"<p>My office has a Nespresso machine. My preferred drink (for taste and caffeine content) is the Espresso Leggero but often all these capsules are gone, so I use maybe a Ristretto capsule or a Luongo capsule, but still use the middle button (espresso amount of drink, I asssume).</p>

<p>What does this do, to the taste and caffeine content? Are the capsules optimised for a certain amount of drink?</p>

"<h2>Peanut butter coffee</h2>

<p>Inspired by your question I did some experimentation. Peanut butter itself did not work well for me, I could not get it to mix well. I happened to have a powdered penut butter, this worked much better.</p>

<p><a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/m9Mfp.jpg"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/m9Mfp.jpg"" alt=""Peanut Butter Powder""></a></p>

<p>I added it like it was powdered cream and sure enough it tasted like peanut butter coffee! The perfect ratio for me seemed to be 2 tbsp per 6 oz cup. It was much better with a little sugar, even though I typically don't add sugar to my coffee. It tasted good, smells great, was more filling then a normal cup of coffee. But the taste was not great, so i won't be drinking it again unless I find a way to improve the taste. The bottom of the cup was very bad because it did not mix fully. So i would recommend blending for anyone who wishes to recreate the coffee treat.</p>

<p>While disapointed with PB coffee. Coffee flavor peanut butter is awesome. Specifically Chocolate Coffee Peanut Butter. As its probable inventor it shall now be called Mocha-PB!  Same ingredients as above except use a chocolate flavored powdered Peanut Butter and change the ratios. Use the instructions on the back of the powdered peanut butter but use hot coffee instead of water. Tastes great on a salty cracker or toast.</p>

"<p>If you're going bigger than 5 gallons for commercial reasons, you'd probably want to start looking at small fermentation tanks (<a href=""https://conical-fermenter.com/40-Gallon-Conical-Fermenter.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://conical-fermenter.com/40-Gallon-Conical-Fermenter.html</a>). However, an incredibly cheaper option would be to buy a Rubbermaid Brute trash can. It might sound bad, but it's actually USDA approved for storing food. And rather than cutting any holes, you could just siphon the coffee out afterwards with a siphon pump.</p>

<p>I wouldn't be so concerned about the freshness of cold-brew. The nature of cold-brew just isn't as fresh as more traditional methods. Of course, if you want to be extreme about it, you could figure out a way to seal it off, and even purge the oxygen from the container before brewing.</p>

"<p>I occasionally hear people saying that coffee has bad implications for the health of teeth. Are there any significant dental studies proving/disproving this statement?</p>
"
"<p>We at Delpac manufacture paper coffee cups.  The inside of the paper is PE polyethylene coated (not wax).  There should not be a taste per se from this material but there is a different ""experience"" from using a ceramic cup or mug.</p>
"
"<p>First, I think you need to start with the quality of the bean you bought. I have noticed both at Sam's Club and Costco that more often than not, the bags of beans are not sealed.  You need to dig to find a bag where the beans don't slide around inside the bag.  If you can shake the bag and the beans move around like a box of cereal, move on to the next bag!  If a bag has lost the seal, you don't know if it has been 'open' for a week or three months.</p>

<p>Second, the debate goes back and forth about freezing or not freezing. Do what fits your life style best.</p>

<p>Third, the more you can limit exposure to oxygen until you use the bean the better.  Coffee beans are like a lot of other items, they can become stale over time if cared for properly.</p>

"<p>A recent study published in <em>Letters in Applied Microbiology</em> suggests that coffee can break down bacterial plaques that form on teeth. These studies were done in a lab on extracted teeth, using moderate amounts of coffee on lab-grown plaques formed by bacteria from saliva. Antibacterial effect of coffee: calcium concentration in a culture containing teeth/biofilm exposed to Coffea Canephora aqueous extract,
<em>Letters in Applied Microbiology,</em> Volume 59, Issue 3, September 2014, Pages: 342–347, N. Meckelburg <em>et al.</em></p>

<p>Coffee can stain teeth. Is that a health issue? It's often listed with other dental health issues but I'm not sure why. </p>

<p>The acidity of coffee may wear down teeth over time, but it's not a prime suspect. The acidity of coffee generally falls somewhere between that of pure water and cow's milk, according to one <a href=""http://www.highergroundstrading.com/blog/38/coffee-acidity:-the-science-and-the-experience--"">article.</a> Fruit juice and soft drinks are far more acidic (pH &lt; 3). Coffee is only slightly more acidic than saliva. There is no shortage of articles claiming high acidity of coffee but 
a pH of 5--a plausible average--is not very high.</p>

<p>There are probably hundreds of studies in English alone on the effect of coffee on dental health. In terms of acidity it's not as bad as juice and not as benign as water. The plaque-preventive effect is something new to consider. There is also a 2012 study by the American Cancer Society suggesting that coffee lowers the risk of oral cancer. Those who drank 4+ cups of coffee a day were about half as likely to die of oral/pharyngeal cancer as those who drank occasionally or not at all. Coffee, Tea, and Fatal Oral/Pharyngeal Cancer in a Large Prospective U.S. Cohort, <em>American Journal of Epidemiology,</em> Dec. 2012 (online), Hildebrand et al. To the extent that oral cancer is a dental health issue this is also something to weigh.  </p>

<p>Science doesn't necessarily furnish a simple answer. It appears that the mildly corrosive effect of coffee may be offset by a tendency to reduce plaque. If coffee helps reduce the risk of oral cancer one could argue that, overall, the benefits of coffee for dental health outweigh the risks. </p>

"<p>I know it's individual, but in general (or at least, in average):</p>

<p>What are the main factors in how long does a coffee's ""high"" last? Can I deliberately make it last more than an hour? More than 3?</p>

<p>I would prefer to actually drink as less as possible, so please consider that.</p>

"<p>First of all, you have to realize that coffee is not the only way to get caffeine, the addictive substance in coffee. Coca-Cola, tea and chocolate also have caffeine. So, the question is not about regulating coffee, but products that roughly 75% of human race consumes.</p>

<p>Second, you have a little sip of cynicism and realize that regulations rarely ate about health. Marijuana was banned mostly to have a legal way to persecute coloured people in USA and to create a market reserve for synthetic fibres against hemp fibres. The UK even fought a war against China for opium. All the regulations we have today on tobacco and alcohol needed to be earned in rough disputes against rich and powerful industrial lobbies. So, even if coffee does some harm to health any restriction is very implausible. </p>

<p>But we don't have any strong evidence that coffee cause any harm to health. Caffeine is addictive, fact, but the addiction <em>per si</em> is not a problem. There are no social drawbacks, like alcoholism and strong drug addiction (lost of work productivity, domestic violence)  and no big social health cost, like tobacco and alcohol.</p>

<p>So any regulation should be based only in the moral aspect that a addiction, even a without social consequences, should be avoided and our social resources should be used by the state to prevent this.</p>

<p>But anything can be addictive. MMORPGS, Netflix, coffee... Should we regulate all things based in this moral argument?</p>

<p>TL:DR</p>

<p>NO.</p>

<p>There is no social consequence of addiction of caffeine to justify the use of social resources by the government regulating it.</p>

"<p>Without considering the amount or potency of the coffee as well as setting personal metabolism aside, you could adjust your coffee schedule according to your natural circadian rhythm, a methodology neuroscientist Steve Miller refers to as <a href=""http://neurosciencedc.blogspot.com.au/2013/10/the-best-time-for-your-coffee.html"">chronopharmacology</a>.  Essentially, you use the caffeine as a propellant to your natural ""up"" rhythm. <a href=""http://food-hacks.wonderhowto.com/how-to/youre-drinking-coffee-wrong-heres-really-maximize-your-daily-caffeine-boosts-0150662/"">Gabrielle Taylor's article</a> does a fine job of explaining this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When you drink coffee during the time when your body is already releasing cortisol, it won't have as strong an effect. Ideally, you want to get your caffeine during the lulls between cortisol spikes—otherwise, you start to develop a tolerance and have to drink more to get the same effect.</p>
  
  <p>Assuming you're on a regular sleep schedule, your cortisol levels naturally spike about an hour after you wake up. If you get up at 7 am, your body is naturally most awake between 8 and 9 in the morning, noon to 1 pm, and again around 5:30-6:30 pm.</p>
  
  <p>So, based on a wake time of 7 am, the best times to drink your caffeine vehicle of choice are 9:30-11:30 am and 1:30-5:00 pm. Obviously you can adjust the schedule according to your own wake time if it's earlier or later. </p>

"<p>I found that generally, scientific studies do show a negative impact on phytochemicals like antioxidants, <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25308682"" rel=""nofollow"">one such example</a> stating:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>An immediate decrease in the total antioxidant activity (23%) and total phenolic content (14%) was observed after addition of strawberry preparations to yoghurt. The total anthocyanin content did not change immediately, but decreased 24% throughout the yoghurt shelf-life. The individual compounds, (+)-catechin (60%), (-)-epicatechin (60%), kaempferol (33%) and quercetin-3-rutinoside (29%) decreased after 24h in the yoghurt made with the strawberry preparation. During the remaining period of storage these compounds increased by 47%, 6%, 4% and 18%, respectively. Pelargonidin-3-glucoside decreased 49% after 28 d. Immediately after the addition of the strawberry preparation to yoghurt, β-lactoglobulin decreased to values lower than the limit of detection and α-lactalbumin by approximately 34%, and was reduced further slowly throughout yoghurt self-life. An immediate interaction between the carrageenan present in the strawberry preparation and β-LG was observed. The variations of both polyphenols and protein in the presence of carrageenan and the potential interactions were discussed</p>

<p>As noted above, some phytochecmicals are available to the consumer longer than others in the presence of dairy. To be fair to the <a href=""http://jn.nutrition.org/content/140/2/259.abstract?etoc"" rel=""nofollow"">American Institute of Nutrition study</a> referred to in the Nestle press release, they do not indicate <em>for how long</em> the antioxidants are still available after the introduction of dairy they only notate that after consumption they found coffee phenolics in the plasma of their test subjects:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Chlorogenic acids (CGA) are antioxidants found in coffee. They are becoming of interest for their health-promoting effects, but bioavailability in humans is not well understood. We hypothesized that adding whole milk or sugar and nondairy creamer to instant coffee might modulate the bioavailability of coffee phenolics. Nine healthy participants were asked to randomly drink, in a crossover design, instant coffee (Coffee); instant coffee and 10% whole milk (Milk); or instant coffee, sugar, and nondairy creamer already premixed (Sugar/NDC). All 3 treatments provided the same amount of total CGA (332 mg). Blood was collected for 12 h after ingestion and plasma samples treated using a liquid-liquid extraction method that included a full enzymatic cleavage to hydrolyze all CGA and conjugates into phenolic acid equivalents. Hence, we focused our liquid chromatography-Electrospray ionization-tandem MS detection and quantification on caffeic acid (CA), ferulic acid (FA), and isoferulic acid (iFA) equivalents. Compared with a regular black instant coffee, the addition of milk did not significantly alter the area under the curve (AUC), maximum plasma concentration (Cmax), or the time needed to reach Cmax (Tmax). The Cmax of CA and iFA were significantly lower and the Tmax of FA and iFA significantly longer for the Sugar/NDC group than for the Coffee group. However, the AUC did not significantly differ. As a conclusion, adding whole milk did not alter the overall bioavailability of coffee phenolic acids, whereas sugar and nondairy creamer affected the Tmax and Cmax but not the appearance of coffee phenolics in plasma.</p>

<p>Whichever line of research you choose to follow, it may not really impact your health over much anyway. The National Center for Complimentary and Integrated Health summarizes antioxidant research saying:</p>

"<h2>Goals</h2>

<p>It sounds like you're starting a small business, in which case, you will quickly outgrow 5 gallon batch sizes as you begin distribution. </p>

<p>Depending on your needs, I would suggest purchasing industrial beer brewing equipment, such as conical fermenters and brite tanks. </p>

<hr>

<h2>Use of Conical Fermenter</h2>

<p><a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/JtmjA.jpg"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/JtmjA.jpg"" alt=""Conical Fermenter""></a></p>

<p>The conical fermenter would allow you to long brew a batch, bubble nitrogen or CO2 up from the bottom for agitation (increasing extraction and preventing oxidation), and will let the grinds settle into the bottom shoulder of the tank when the brewing process is complete. </p>

<hr>

<h2>Use of Brite Tanks</h2>

<p><a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/iggKD.jpg"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/iggKD.jpg"" alt=""Large Brite Tank""></a> </p>

<p>Brite tanks come in a range of sizes from ~1 gallon up to tens of thousands of gallons. They are primarily used as a glycol jacketed pressure rated storage vessel for keeping beer (and similar beverages) in optimial conditions before storage. They may also be used as part of the forced carbonation of the liquid in the tank.  A brite tank will be useful for your cold brew business as you scale up because it will give you an intermediary vessel to blend out and store batches before packaging. </p>

<hr>

<h2>Scaling up your production</h2>

<p>Depending on your business plans and packaging / distribution ability, 
you will probably want to start with a slightly larger setup that gives you 1) room to grow and 2) the ability to expand without changing process or systems. Beer equiptment is well suited to meet these goals. </p>

<hr>

<h2>Quality, consistency, and some notes on process:</h2>

<p>The majority of consumers demand a consistent product with an interesting flavor-profile that they can enjoy <em>every</em> time they purchase your product. Flavor-profile deviations will cause you to loose consumers to a more consistent product in the long run. The following points will help ensure a more consistent product: </p>

<ol>
<li>blend out batches of cold brew from the fermenters into a single brite tank</li>
<li>use CO2 or nitrogen to prevent oxidation</li>
<li>manual agitation is inconsistent - use a bubbler with CO2 or nitrogrn instead. This will also help with goal 2. </li>
<li>Packaging lines make a huge difference. Invest for growth in a rotary topper, not a 4 or 6 head. </li>
<li>Don't attempt to use the same blend of beans for cold brew, draft cold brew, and nitro. </li>
</ol>
"
"<p>The standard recommended ratios for cold brew are: </p>

<p><code>
|   Roaster      | oz Coffee | oz water |   time   | ratio | 
|----------------------------------------------------------| 
|Stumptown       | 12oz      | 56oz     | 16 hours | .214  | 
|Blue Bottle     | 16oz      | 67.6oz   | 12 hour  | .236  | 
|Ritual          | 4oz       | 35.2oz   | 18 hours | .113  | 
|Intelligentsia  | 8oz       | 56oz     | 12 hours | .142  |
</code></p>

<p>These recipes vary in concentration - the lower ~0.1 recipes are designed to be consumed without dilution, while the ~0.2 recipes are designed to be consumed in a 1:2 cold brew concentrate to water dilution. </p>

"<p>Some upperclass chemistry students at the University of Delaware put together <a href=""http://udel.edu/~danikoll/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">a nice site that summarizes the effects of caffeine</a>.</p>

<p>Particularly relevant is their page on <a href=""http://udel.edu/~danikoll/metabolism.html"" rel=""nofollow"">metabolism of caffeine</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Caffeine is absorbed in the small intestine, metabolized in the liver cell and distributed to body tissues within 45 minutes of ingestion.</p>
  
  <p>It has a half-life of 3-5 hours in adults but can have a half-life of up to 80 hours in pregnant women prior to delivery.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A technical term in the literature is ""oral clearance"", meaning the rate at which a drug administered orally is removed from the body, the three elimination pathways being renal, hepatic, and pneumatic.  As the references in the above link document, caffeine is eliminated primarily by the liver breaking it down into paraxanthine (84%), theobromine (12%), and theophylline (4%).  While these last two compounds have some CNS effects, it is believed that largely caffeine itself acts by competing with adenosine for adenosine receptors.</p>

<hr>

<p>The simplest way to extend a caffeine buzz (setting aside pregnancy as impractical for most) is to consume more caffeine.  [A more difficult challenge might be finding a way to <em>shorten</em> the duration of a coffee buzz.]</p>

<p>A 1985 study <a href=""http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00544361"" rel=""nofollow"">by Abernethy and Todd</a>, ""Impairment of caffeine clearance by chronic use of low-dose oestrogen-containing oral contraceptives"", demonstrated that the half-life of caffeine is extended by progesterone administration.</p>

<p>You say that you wish to consume as little coffee as possible, so perhaps the same amount of coffee (espresso, once every other day) could be taken in divided doses.  This then converts the problem into how to create an equally intense buzz with (say) only half the caffeine.</p>

<p>I've noticed is that a sharp reduction in carbohydrates leads (after a couple of weeks, with mild ketosis) to a stronger physiological response to caffeine.  </p>

<p>I can only offer this as an anecdotal observation.  There is research on the interaction of <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20521321"" rel=""nofollow"">caffeine and glucose on cognitive processing</a> and on the effects of <a href=""http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/87/5/1254.full"" rel=""nofollow"">caffeine consumption on glucose homeostasis</a>.  But neither topic is precisely like what I'm suggesting.</p>

"<p>I will not go into details, or reasons (political, economic, logistic or otherwise), but in my country, coffee has been scarce and expensive in the last couple of years.</p>

<p>I've been suspecting that some coffee producers have been cutting it (mixing it) with cheaper things. The unmistakable aroma of coffee is now mixed with some bitter tones sometimes, fishy tones some other times. The flavor is not quite coffee also.  It's been so long since I've smelled the unmistakable aroma of real,  honest to God coffee. I'm almost 100% convinced that they are mixing it with roasted black beans or something.</p>

<p>My questions is, what other grains, nuts or whatever do coffee produces  usually mix ground coffee with in order to make it cheaper? </p>

<p>How can I check whether or not the ground coffee has been mixed up?</p>
"
"<p>I will <em>not</em> go into any political discussion, theory or similar, but I <em>can</em> give you a few historical facts.</p>

<p>There have always been times in the last few centuries when coffee was a rare commodity. And it has always been expensive to some degree, making it ""something for special occasions"" in the poorer parts of European societies.</p>

<p>People used and still use various ""<a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_substitute"">substitutes</a>"" from grains (barley, spelt, rice), roots (chiccory, dandelion), fruit (acorns, dates), typically roasted, ground and prepared like coffee beans, resulting in a somewhat bitter, dark drink more or less resembling genuine coffee. (For a more extensive list, see the link above.) </p>

<p>Instead of replacing coffee, they can also be mixed with coffee, ""stretching"" the yield of the coffee beans.</p>

<p>If you want to check your coffee for ""fillers"", buy whole beans - none of the coffee substitutes look even remotely like coffee beans.</p>
"
"<p>An easy (but unscrupulous) way to lower the seller's cost of coffee is to add coffee that is cheaper, older, or unfit for consumption because spoiled or contaminated. The frequency and severity of this problem is almost impossible to quantify because the resale of such coffee is by definition illegal and, when discovered, probably not front-page news. </p>

<p>Commodity coffee <em>may</em> be especially susceptible to this sort of chicanery because, although it is highly regulated, it may be stored in large quantities and even a slight delay in delivery (perhaps to influence the market) can result in spoilage. <em>Penicillium</em> mold is present in most unroasted beans as an <a href=""http://www.ars.usda.gov/SP2UserFiles/person/5818/Penicilliumspeciesendophyticincoffeeplants--Mycologia9831-42.pdf"">endophyte</a>--normally benign but capable of causing damage under the right conditions, and other <a href=""http://www.teaandcoffee.net/0507/coffee.htm"">mold pathogens</a> can ruin coffee if a narrow range of storage climate is exceeded.  </p>

<p>All these (and more) can affect the taste and aroma of the retail product. If coffee smells or tastes bad, spoilage due to storage/handling is a possibility. The seller may have blended marketable coffee with marginally marketable coffee.</p>
"
"<p>I often find that standard espresso shots at many high-end coffeeshops to be more sour than I prefer. I tend to order straight espresso, or Americanos with only a little water, or maybe a macchiatto, so there's not much fat to cut the tartness. What should I say to get a less acidic shot?</p>
"
"<p>Taste is subjective but a high-end espresso should not taste sour. Old coffee, poorly roasted coffee, and inferior grade coffee are the main culprits. </p>

<p>The following is a pet theory, not science: cafes that charge a lot for coffee to cover overhead--or just because they think they can--sometimes have a low regard for the customer. Sometimes the best cup of espresso comes from a smaller cafe that depends on loyal customers for survival or is in business because the owner takes pride in serving good stuff. </p>

<p>You shouldn't have to say anything to get a less acidic shot. If you are paying for good espresso you should get it--with the qualification that any cafe has a cycle of re-stocking and so some variation in quality is normal. </p>
"
"<p>Here's a few thoughts based on what causes sourness/acidity in coffee and ways to temper it.</p>

<p><strong>Order an <em>espresso lungo</em>.</strong> Sourness (acidity) is characteristic of the ""stuff"" that is extracted relatively early in the brewing process. In other brewing methods that take longer to perform (e.g., coffee press, drip, or pour-over) this can be balanced by the more bitter notes that take somewhat longer to fully extract. For this reason, you might get a result that is more appealing to you by ordering an espresso that takes longer to pull, i.e., espresso <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lungo"">lungo</a>. Not everyone behind every coffee counter will be immediately familiar with this, but at good cafes with good machines an espresso lungo should be no problem.</p>

<p><strong>Try a <em>darker roast</em>.</strong> Darker roast coffees tend to be less acidic than lighter roasts, at the expense of losing more of the varietal/regional notes. Many cafes have really only one bean/roast that they use for every espresso (often because of the practical considerations of having several grinder hoppers full of beans), but if you have an option, try a darker-roasted bean.</p>

<p><strong>Try beans from a <em>different region</em>.</strong> To my taste, Indonesian coffees tend to have less pronounced acidic notes than African or American coffees. Again, if multiple coffees are available for espresso, pick a coffee that you like (or find less sour) for any other preparation.</p>

<p><strong>Pick beans further off of the roast.</strong> This is really only for completeness, but beans that were <em>very</em> freshly/recently roasted (i.e., less than a few days) can have accentuated acidity because some undesirable volatiles haven't yet had a chance to leach out. This is more toward what @daniel noted; this is the kind of thing <em>you</em> shouldn't need to be concerned about at a cafe -- <em>they</em> should!</p>

<p>A cafe affiliated with a local roaster (or any specialty cafe) should be able to tell you lots of things about the coffee when asked, such as region, varietal, roast level, and roast date. Here's a <a href=""http://drinks.seriouseats.com/2013/07/home-coffee-brewing-troubleshooting-grind-size-brew-time.html"">Serious Eats article about ""problems""</a> and related solutions that touch on some of the things I talked about above.

<p>The difference is a <strong>58 to 43 ratio</strong>.</p>

<p>Now, assuming most of the coffee brands listed on their <a href=""http://www.caffeineinformer.com/the-caffeine-database"" rel=""nofollow"">caffeine database</a> are brewed using the standard drip method, you could calculate the average french press ammount of caffeine per brand of coffee by taking the 58/43 ratio of depreciation into consideration.</p>

<p>Similar rues apply for coffee, from a small espresso or mokka cup in southern Europe or the Arab world to a mug of filtered coffee in the US. </p>

<p>There seems to be one correlation though - the ""stronger"" (=more concetrated) a coffe is customarily prepared, the smaller the cup. The amount of ground coffee per ""serving unit"" seems surprisingly constant for the various preparation styles - about a heaping teaspoon per ""cup"". The rest is a matter of taste.</p>
"
"<p>The exact liquid measurement of a ""cup"" as noted on the side of a coffee maker is subjective since there is no industry wide standard unit of measure. Lee Denny explains this <a href=""http://EzineArticles.com/6568161"" rel=""nofollow"">in his article</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One thing is for sure: a ""cup"" of coffee does not fill up the typical 12 oz. coffee mug found in most American homes.</p>
  
  <p>Ounces per Cup in Popular Coffee Maker Brands</p>
  
  <p>Bunn: 5 oz</p>
  
  <p>Bodum (Vacuum): 5.7 oz</p>
  
  <p>Capresso: 5 oz</p>
  
  <p>Cona: 5.5 oz to 5.7 oz</p>
  
  <p>Cuisinart: 5 oz</p>
  
  <p>Krups: 5 oz</p>
  
  <p>Proctor Silex: 4.5 oz</p>
  
  <p>Technivorm: 4.2 oz</p>
  
  <p>Zojirushi: 5.1 oz</p>
  
  <p>To complicate things even further, coffee brewing instructions frequently tell you how much ground coffee to add for every 6 ounces of water. You'll see this metric on the back of a can of Maxwell House as well as published by coffee authorities such as the National Coffee Association of U.S.A., Inc. Further proof of the lack of standardization.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That being said, neither is their an internationally recognized standard measure for what a ""cup"" is since American uses cup measurements while many other countries use kitchen scales to mete out ingredients by weight. <a href=""http://www.telegraph.co.uk/food-and-drink/equipment/dear-americans-im-fed-up-with-your-stupid-cup-measurements/"" rel=""nofollow"">This entertaining article</a> Sue Quinn wrote for The Telegraph explores this difference:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Here in the UK, we love your food, we really do. We guzzle your dirty burgers, crave your Cronuts and scoff your hot dogs like there’s no tomorrow. But your recipes are giving us heartburn. Why on earth do your cookbooks and food websites cling to cup measures when kitchen scales are much easier, more precise and infinitely less faff?</p>

<p>Quinn provides an excellent <a href=""https://www.dovesfarm.co.uk/resources/conversion-tables/us-cups-conversion-table/"" rel=""nofollow"">cups - metric weight guide</a> if you are interested in eliminating the cup conundrum by buying a kitchen scale for use going forward. If you do make the switch to weights, then try <a href=""http://www.ncausa.org/About-Coffee/How-to-Brew-Coffee"" rel=""nofollow"">the National Coffee Association's recipe</a>: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A general guideline is one to two tablespoons of ground coffee for every six ounces of water. This can be adjusted to suit individual taste preferences.  </p>
  
  <p>Be sure to check the “cup” lines on your brewer to see how they actually measure. And remember that some water is lost to evaporation in certain brewing methods. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you are still interested in pursuing cup measurement, it may interest you to know that Fannie Farmer is given much credit for establishing the American way of measuring ingredients as noted by Bill Daily in <a href=""http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-03-21/features/sc-food-0316-giants-farmer-20120321_1_fannie-merritt-farmer-cookbook-marion-cunningham"" rel=""nofollow"">this Chicago Tribune article</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Fannie Merritt Farmer was an influential New England cooking teacher with a flair for marketing and promotion whose 1896 ""The Boston Cooking-School Cook Book"" and myriad subsequent editions have made her a household name for more than a century.</p>
  
  <p>Often called the ""mother of level measurements"" for her insistence on the use of measuring cups and spoons in cooking and in recipes, Farmer shaped the appetites of a nation through her cookbook. </p>

"<p>Another approach, probably yielding a more subtle taste is roasting the green beans with the oils of the taste you're going for.</p>

<p>I've once tried, with moderate success, to roast a small batch of butterscotch coffee, since I had the corresponding oil available. </p>

<p>The success was moderate, partly because it was a pan roast, and I'm still new at this, however it makes for a fun experiment, and introduces you to the roasting process (as if I needed to fixate on coffee more..).</p>

<p>A nice roasting guide is <a href=""http://www.angelfire.com/pro2/panroastingcoffee/howtopanroastcoffee2.html/"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>. When the part where the bean oils start to develop comes, that's where you throw in no more than 4 or 5 teaspoons of the oil with the flavor you want. Of course, you can adjust this with smell, and depending on the amount of beans you're roasting. You then go on with the process according to instructions. </p>

<p>For peanut butter flavour, since I found no PB oil with a quick search, I'd add the oil on top of a jar, or mix concentrated oils that make something near the yummy PB flavor</p>

"<p>Out of personal experience, I get a pretty long and persistent buzz when I take coffee, go to sleep, and wake up 40-45 minutes later. </p>
"
"<p>I have felt that percolated/french pressed coffee keeps me awake more than instant coffee brew. </p>

<p>EDIT: Since it was (validly) pointed out it will depend on the amount, so the amount, that I am comparing is basically what is mentioned on the packet of instant or ground coffee (whichever is the case). 
As in if my instant coffee sachet says it makes 2 cups of coffee, I use half of it. And if the ground coffee says to use the filtrate of 2 tablespoons for each cup, I do the same. </p>
"
"<p>Funny you ask this. I can't remember the exact reason why, but I was just reading the other day that how hydrated you are has a pretty large effect on whether on your coffee tolerance. Turns out, the more water you drink, the more buzzed you feel. </p>

<p>If I were you, I'd be careful. It's finals for me right now, and I have so much work, you wouldn't believe. Last night, I decided to drink a medium dark roast with a shot of expresso.... boy! I had the shakes. Every time I would try and concentrate, I could literally feel my brain itch. It's like this tingly sensation that you can't get rid of. Plus, I had the shakes. I still haven't been to sleep and it's about one, here. The most I can manage is about 5 minutes at a time.. but I digress.</p>

<p>Drink more water and double up on the expresso. Just make sure that you sip slowly.. and with discretion.</p>

<p>What are the important features to look for when purchasing a cezve, as far as function or usability is concerned?</p>
"
"<p>I may be wrong but I think it's because instant has already been processed.</p>

<p>If you're using ground coffee it's much more likely that any substances that coffee would normally come with would be better retained in the grounds. Whereas with instant coffee, the process of creating these easily dissolving granules would have most likely caused shedding of a lot of the original substance content, which includes caffeine. Of course in this process manufacturers can add their own extras which might include extra caffeine but assuming that they don't, you would have lost some of the chemicals that keep you awake.</p>
"
"<p>Caffeine content varies greatly by preparation and brew method.  Instant coffee is generally designed to produce something close to a cup of drip coffee.  ""Cups"" is unfortunately not well defined and may vary based on it's usage.  Beyond that, percolated and french press coffee is generally prepared stronger (more concentrated) that regular drip coffee (and probably much stronger than the watered down concentration instant is designed for).  It's also very likely that some amount of caffeine is lost during the freeze dry process since it is so water soluble.  </p>

<p>TL;DR Yes.  Real brewed coffee will generally have a higher caffeine concentration than coffee that has been brewed, dehydrated, then re-hydrated.</p>

"<p>I understand the of course the filter must be able to contain at least the amount of grounds for the cups you intend to brew. </p>

<p>However, I am using an <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B001K66LPQ"" rel=""nofollow"">8-12 cup machine</a> even though I live alone and generally only make 2-4 cups in the morning (sometimes 6 if I take some to work). <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B001UBNRH6"" rel=""nofollow"">My filters</a> are thus also that size. I use <a href=""https://www.cajungrocer.com/french-market-coffee-chicory-creole-roast.html?cvsfa=1338&amp;cvsfe=2&amp;cvsfhu=31373436&amp;gclid=CjwKEAiA1o-zBRDomsWasvKh4S8SJADSlZkqf7B2ikYJXNaZM92s0zvKEDCUUrQrKSJVR8N_K2JtzRoCLBzw_wcB"" rel=""nofollow"">this coffee.</a></p>

<p>After a recent trip to India and having enjoyed <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_filter_coffee"" rel=""nofollow"">filter coffee</a>, I started paying a bit more attention to try to get closer to that style (hence the chicory coffee).</p>

<ol>
<li>Compression appears to be key for this style of coffee. With a flat-bottom, 8-12 cup filter with only 3 tbsp of grounds, the grounds appear to be very loose (obviously).</li>
<li>I then try to stamp it down a bit with the tablespoon, but this makes the layer quite thin in my very non-expert opinion.</li>
<li>After the brewing is done and I dispose of the filter, I notice that there is a hole in the middle of the grounds where you can directly see the filter (no hole through the filter itself).</li>
</ol>

<p>I'm not so picky about taste, but this made me think that perhaps such a wide filter may not be suited for the small amounts I'm brewing. Is this true?</p>
"
"<p>I would agree with you.  With the thin flat layer of coffee the hot water is just pushing a hole right through it.  You are not getting nearly the contact time of a full size brew.  </p>

<p>If it was conical or V shaped filter then it would better accommodate different size batches.  </p>

<p>On that pot it does not look like you could just simply use a different filter size.</p>
"
"<p>Is there a site or feed which would collect current coffee offer from various roasters especially specialty coffee roasters? I like to try wide range of coffees and so far I'm checking several website-shops to see what is new. Maybe someone is already collecting this information on a single spot. </p>
"
"<p>Generally, there is a rule of 15 (<a href=""http://coffeegeek.com/forums/coffee/questions/543604"" rel=""nofollow"">http://coffeegeek.com/forums/coffee/questions/543604</a>). Green coffee lasts fresh for 15 months, roasted (stored in an opaque, air-tight, slightly-below-room-temp container) 15 days and ground 15 minutes. </p>

<p>This applies mainly to specialty coffee since it has the most aromas and tastes. Even if you open a bag of beans and do not grind them, once the air reaches the beans you can notice that taste degrades in few days. You would have to get most of the air of the container so that the coffee lasts 15 days mentioned above. </p>
"
"<p>I have never heard of a site specifically for that, but definitely hit up Sprudge if you never have. It is certainly the leading site for all coffee information - and it's very easy to scroll through and find new coffee companies that are all doing great things. </p>

"<p>Well if you put it into a fridge, all you are doing is slowing down the process. Cold brew is one of the hardest things to mess up if you ask me, so I would just brew it room temperature. If you extend a brew process in time - than you generally have a larger interval of time where the coffee will still taste great, but since it's already hours long I really wouldn't worry about it. All the shops i've ever worked at brew room temperature. Hope this helps!</p>
"
"<p>I just read online that some people roast their coffee bean before they grind the bean, to adjust the flavor. This sounds really interesting, and I would like to try. I would like to do this properly, and I am wondering about couple of things:</p>

<ol>
<li>What temperature to use, and for how long? I would imagine that this is determined by the current roast of the coffee and the target roast I would like, is there any kind of lookup table as a guidance?</li>
<li>Some people mentioned cooling and de-gas after roast. What does that mean? I understand the cooling part, but what kind of process is de-gas - I guess it is some process happening on its own as the bean is cooled, but I am curious what exactly it is.</li>
</ol>
"
"<p>On the less conspiratorial side of things, the problems you are describing can also be explained by less sinister circumstances.  Coffee that has been roasted too dark is often bitter and somewhat fishy (depending on the varietal of beans and other factors).  Robusta beans may also be blended with the more widely accepted Arabica coffee to lower cost and increase caffeine levels in the final blend, but it generally has poorer taste and is bitter.</p>

<p>Many mass producers of coffee roast their beans dark because the roast flavors become more pronounced and the origin favors fade, producing a more standardized product, but generally also a more bitter one.  It's possible that you just don't like darkly roasted coffee, which is what is generally available at the overwhelming number of chain shops.</p>
"
"<p>Your first question isn't clear exactly.  All <strong>drinkable coffee</strong> has been roasted first, as raw coffee beans are not edible. I've read that re-roasting beans isn't practical for some reason that I'm not clear on, but I agree with Peter Pei Guo's, comment about why you would want to re-roast coffee in the first place.  </p>

<p>Immediately after roasting, coffee beans produce carbon dioxide gas as a result of the chemical changes happening inside the bean.  This gas takes some time to be released from the interior of the bean, anywhere <strong>from 3-5 days</strong>.  </p>

<p>I've brewed my own home roasted coffee immediately after roasting to see if this is really true, and yes, it is.  </p>

<p>Immediately after roasting the coffee has a really harsh, sour taste from the acidity that accompanies carbon dioxide gas (carbolic acid).  It also foamed (bloomed) really violently with the addition of hot water.  After resting the roasted coffee for about <strong>5 days</strong>, the coffee from the same batch of beans <strong>tasted great</strong>. </p>

<p>One of <strong>the indicators</strong> of freshly roasted coffee beans is <strong>the bloom</strong> that they produce as some residual carbon dioxide gas is released with <strong>the addition of hot water</strong>.  </p>

<p>As <em>time passes</em> and the beans begin to stale a bit, the <em>bloom lessens</em>, then <strong>disappears</strong>.  After properly resting freshly roasted coffee however, <strong>the small amount of residual carbon dioxide doesn't affect the taste</strong>.  Immediately <em>after roasting</em> however, the <em>carbon dioxide</em> levels are <strong>too high</strong> to allow good tasting coffee when brewed.  </p>

"<p>So, I'm usually a pourover-coffee drinker, and I know a little bit more about that side of the spectrum … but lately (somewhat to my own shame) I've gotten into Starbucks lattes. Like, ‘more than one a day,’ into. I've got an old Nespresso machine from when I first started drinking coffee and espresso, and didn't know which I'd like more (I took both straight at the time.)</p>

<p>I've started trying to make my own lattes at home with the Nespresso, to save money and time, but I have no idea what I'm doing, and I'm having terrible results. Most importantly, I can't figure out how a Starbucks barista is getting <em>twenty ounces</em> of final product, from two shots of espresso. When I'm using the Nespresso (pull one ‘latte’, pull a second ‘lungo’ into the latte), I get maybe 9oz of coffee-product; and that's <em>stretching</em> the phrase, as it's basically slightly-coffee-tainted steamed-milk. (It's barely even brown!)</p>

<hr>

<p>Help me get from where I am, to having a drinkable 20+oz beverage, <em>without</em> having to pull like 6 shots of espresso (and 450mg of caffeine) into my travel mug? /=</p>
"
"<p>Assuming you are not planning to buy a lot more machinery, you can simply use the Nespresso to make <strong><em>espresso</em></strong> - depending on your preferred strength, two to three shots should be what you need for your 20 oz mug.</p>

<p>But that's basically a puddle in your mug:<br>
You need to fill the other 16 oz. and you do that with <strong>steamed (foamy) milk</strong>. If you wanted to do this ""correctly"", you would use the steam wand of your espresso machine - which the Nespresso doesn't have, I presume.   </p>

<ul>
<li>If you have an immersion blender, preferably with a disk, heat (not boil!) your milk and whizz it until you get soft foam.   </li>
<li>Other options are a stovetop or electric milk frother - the manual pump-action ones are available for the price of four to five Starbucks coffees, the electric ones cost a bit more. </li>
<li>Do not buy one of these teeny-tiny hand-held flimsy wire-whisk stirrers, they are a funny gadget but not sturdy enough for daily use and large volumes of milk.</li>
</ul>

<p>The milk-to-foam-to-espresso ratio is up to you, find what you like best. I suggest starting somewhere at about two thirds milk / one third foam plus three shots and tweak your drink until you find your preferred recipe.</p>

"<p>Tiramisu is a famous Italian desert made of, among others, mascarpone and coffee.</p>

<p>As an Italian desert, I believe that an Italian roast of some blend is best to match the rich mascarpone and alcohol tastes.</p>

<p>Is there a ""standard"" roast or blend combination?</p>
"
"<p>From a cooks perspective, I think it should be ""espresso"", or ""caffè"" not ""coffee"" in any good tiramisu recipe, which in turn would already suggest a type of beans and roast. </p>

<p>Note that the Italian term caffè denotes the strong black liquid you get from an esspesso machine or a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moka_pot"">moka</a>. </p>

<p>The coffee in a tiramisu has to be concentrated to supply enough flavour without soaking the ladyfingers or other bisquits used. (The same principle applies when you use a liquor.)</p>

<p>When choosing the beans /the roast, the same rule as for wine applies: Use what you drink. And seriously, unless you are making an insane amount of tiramisu, you will be using only very little of one pack of coffee.<br>
I use whatever I choose for my Espresso (if I feel rich, I'll splurge on something from my local roaster, in a pinch the usual suspects like Illy or Lavazza, sometimes even a Starbucks Espresso roast <em>cough</em>) and call it a day.</p>

<p>So in sort, get a classic Italian espresso roast, prepare it authentically and you should be fine. In a pinch, use another coffee, but make sure it is very strong. You'll need a few tablespoons tops for a standard tiramisu recipe.</p>
"
"<p>This is a bit more complex than it seems at first blush. The reason why instant coffee may have <strong>more</strong> caffeine than your typical brewed coffee is that it's usually <em>Robusta</em> instead of <em>Arabica</em> coffee. Or some blend of the two.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.barkingdogcoffee.com/our-coffee/arabica-vs-robusta/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.barkingdogcoffee.com/our-coffee/arabica-vs-robusta/</a></p>

<p>A cup of joe at Peets, Starbucks, etc, will be made with Arabica beans exclusively, and therefore have a lot less caffeine than the Robusta instant coffee.</p>

<p>It also depends on how finely you grind your french press grounds. You may be getting more solids in your cup of coffee with a french press (and it's hard to compare french press vs instant coffee by weight since instant is so processed). Also, some Arabica beans have more caffeine content than others. Thus, you may well be getting more caffeine from the dosage of french press coffee than your instant coffee.</p>

<p>There are a lot of variables to consider, and the answer is unclear.</p>

"<p><strong>Consider also using a strong preparation of instant coffee</strong> or Turkish coffee as an alternative.</p>

<p>This will allow cooks in an ""under-equipped"" kitchen (said in jest only!) to prepare a coffee of as strong a preparation as you'd like, in the absence of <a href=""/questions/tagged/moka"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;moka&#39;"" rel=""tag"">moka</a> or espresso machine.

<p>As for the roast level, I think this is more personal preference. Your options are limited in commercially available instant coffee powder, but the sky is the limit with other preparations. For tiramisu <strong>I tend to prefer a very dark roast</strong> (French roast, or Italian roast like @Stephie recommended), which I find to be a good complement to rum, but any roast will do. On the other hand, <strong>a bit of bright acidity from a lighter-roasted American coffee</strong> would probably be a great complement for the creaminess. </p>

"<p>I think you gave a good overview of everything. Here's a few comments on your list that I find is most important from my own personal experience, and from <a href=""http://www.bialetti.com/coffee/stovetop/moka-express-c-1_7_22.html"" rel=""nofollow"">this Bialetti guide</a>.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>""Moka"" grind is imperative.</strong> Most guidelines that I have seen recommend somewhere coarser than espresso and finer than drip (e.g., <a href=""http://www.illy.com/wps/wcm/connect/en/coffee-at-home/coffee-for-moka"" rel=""nofollow"">illy</a>, <a href=""https://bluebottlecoffee.com/preparation-guides/bialetti-moka-pot"" rel=""nofollow"">Blue Bottle</a>, and a bunch of blogs when searching ""best grind for moka"" or so). Finer and you might overextract and result in a bitter brew; too-coarse and the machine won't extract properly or develop any pressure in the bottom chamber.</li>
<li><strong>The amount of water is almost completely determined by the size of the moka pot</strong>. Fill nearly (but not quite) up to the over-pressure relief valve; looks a bit like a button. The moka pot is made to brew exactly that amount of coffee; no more, no less.</li>
<li>(exactly as you said). Amount of coffee: filled to the top of the funnel, but not tamped.</li>
<li>Heat: for a gas-flame-burner, as with any pot, matched to pot size is best. <strong>The flame being completely under and within the base is best.</strong> It should heat quickly, but the flame should not creep around the sides; you want the bottom to be heated only, not the sides and certainly not the top vessel! This is the reason for the shape of this and a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cezve"" rel=""nofollow"">cezve</a> having a wide bottom.</li>
<li><strong>Turn off as soon as the machine starts coughing or sputtering.</strong> At this point the water level is below the bottom of the funnel straw, and no more (desirable) extraction will occur.</li>
<li><strong>Serve as soon as safe!</strong> Soon after the fire is off, it should stop sputtering. Best to pour and serve immediately thereafter. </li>
</ol>

<p>and...</p>

<ol start=""7"">
<li>One thing you didn't mention: <strong>it's best to fill the bottom chamber (carefully!) with already-boiling water</strong> (as in Blue Bottle guide, linked above.) This ensures that the water boils quickly and evenly, and minimizes the amount of (undesirable) ""steaming"" and heat prior to brewing to which the grounds will be subjected.</li>
</ol>

<p>As for the crema, I've never been able to create crema with anything other than a proper espresso machine, as noted in <a href=""http://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/97/generating-crema-with-a-moka-pot"">this moka question I had linked</a>.</p>
"
"<p>I recently read an article on <a href=""http://www.handground.com/grind/the-chemistry-of-grinding-coffee-beans"">chemistry of grinding coffee beans</a> and it suggests stale coffee might be less healthy than freshly-roasted coffee, in terms of micronutrient and antioxidant loss over time after roasting. </p>

<p>The argument makes sense but I don't think there's been research specifically on the loss of antioxidants as coffee goes bad. I'm curious what you think... maybe we can use the ""Wisdom of Crowds"" to find the right answer. </p>

"<p>I have a saeco espresso machine. When I place the porta filter into the machine, it is very difficult to turn. Any suggestions </p>
"
"<p>As it was already mentioned the some of the main parameters determining coffee taste are:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Coffee related:</p>

<ul>
<li>beans origin and quality.</li>
<li>beans roasting and time passed.</li>
<li>beans grounding and time passed.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Machine related:</p>

<ul>
<li>water quality.</li>
<li>water desalination frequency.</li>
<li>general cleanliness of the machine and the environment.</li>
<li><strong>lower water temperature of extraction. If the machine temperature is lower due lack of periodical calibration, the coffee tastes sour and flat.</strong> </li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Preparation related:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>extracted coffee exposure to the atmosphere. The longer is stays exposed, the more it reacts with the atmospheric oxygen and oxidizes, thus becoming more sour. This is true especially for all the coffees with added water (<em>Americano, lungo</em>) that breaks the thin layer covering and preserving the coffee's nice taste qualities.</strong></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Consumption of additional beverage or/and snack together with the coffee. </p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>if the additional food or/and drink consumed together with the coffee contains more sugar, then your coffee will always taste sour.</strong> (The effect is similar to when you eat chocolate first and then eat an apple, the apple tastes much sour.) </p></li>
<li><p>smoking affects taste receptors as well and it should be taken into consideration, i.e. you receptors are less sensitive and there is no point in buying coffee from high-end shops, as you are unable to feel the taste.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>Generally, if you want to experience the best quality of a given espresso, you should order it <em>ristretto</em>. The ordinary espresso extraction time is around 25 seconds (1ml / sec) and you get a full shot. <em>Ristretto</em> reduces the extraction time, usually by half, and cuts the last drops of water that contain lower concentration of coffee extract, thus keeping the strong <em>aroma</em> and different <em>taste balance</em>. In the ideal case it should be consumed as fast as possible, just like a gourmé meal.</p>
"
"<p>Adding some thinking out of the box to all the great answers, I would say:</p>

<p>You should not store it, instead try buying less quantity, consistent with your rate of consumption, more often. In this way it's quality will be as near with its production quality.</p>

<p>As an argument I will point out that oxidization is an effect that can not be prevented easily and once exposed to the atmosphere the coffee interacts with the environment via the moisture it absorbs and all the smells contained within it. That is why <em>Illy</em> seals its containers with Nitrogen to try and isolate it from the environment, as much as possible, till it is opened. </p>
"
"<p>Based on some common sense and on (not very numerous) articles online, I could think of the following advantages of roasting at home:</p>

<ul>
<li>you get the freshest possible coffee as you need it</li>
<li>green beans are significantly cheaper than roasted ones, and keep longer</li>
<li>you get finer control over the result (?) than just guided by labels on coffee bags</li>
</ul>

<p>But there are also downsides:</p>

<ul>
<li>there's smoke during the roasting that you need to handle (see also <a href=""http://coffee.stackexchange.com/q/186/277"">Home roasting and ventilation</a>)</li>
<li>you need some specialized (and more or less expensive) equipment, or else invent tricks <a href=""http://coffee.stackexchange.com/q/2093/277"">with a popcorn popper</a> or <a href=""http://www.angelfire.com/pro2/panroastingcoffee/howtopanroastcoffee2.html/"">a cast iron pan</a> (which may not be too bad in fact)</li>
<li>in order to obtain the finer control over the result you need to know what you're doing (which probably means you may not get a better-than-shop result in a number of initial trials) (e.g., <a href=""http://coffee.stackexchange.com/q/1686/277"">this question</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>All of that is my armchair coffee science though, and I hope that the practitioners here can say what of that is real and what is fictional, and what other reasons there are pro and contra homeroasting.</p>
"
"<p>You have already listed most of the main points and hit them correctly, but I'll add some additional.</p>

<p>Pros:
You can get things not available commercially, and generally a much wider variety of coffee.  For instance, almost all Sumatran coffee is traditionally dark roasted by companies.  However, light roasted Sumatran coffee has a truly unique set of flavors that is fairly distinct from anything else, without light roasting some yourself, you'd be hard pressed (or French pressed if you are into that) to ever find it fresh.  Tastes are remarkably individual and it's highly likely that you like may really like some random type of coffee that either isn't a big seller and available, or isn't traditionally roasted how you prefer. </p>

<p>Cons:
Time.  Roasting takes some amount of your time.  It takes far more when you start (I can now roast a pound of coffee in roughly 5 minutes of my time, because the machine does most of the work and I have a system).  Depending on your equipment and learning curve, this can vary widely.  With the equipment I started with and my initial knowledge, a pound of coffee would have taken me a full hour to roast.  </p>

<p>Snobbery.  You will likely get to the point were most other coffee that's commercially produced will be unthinkable to you.  I can't drink coffee at any restaurant without cream (I normally drink it black).  I have a few friends who roast and their coffee is the exception.  But, more or less, home roasting may ruin ""other"" coffee for you.  Along these lines, you may get to the point where you don't enjoy roasting as much anymore, you just want the coffee.  If your time curve is fine, then it works out.  If it's not you might be left with the terrible choice between doing something you don't love or buying less good coffee.</p>

"<p>I just picked up a gaggia classic and I am wondering if my delicious denver tap water will do the trick or if i should go with something bottled. I am looking <a href=""http://www.scaa.org/?page=resources&amp;d=water-standards"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a> for the espresso standards and <a href=""http://www.denverwater.org/docs/assets/5EB822C6-EDF3-C0C9-871E2F58438E152B/2013WaterQualityReport.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a> for the denver water report. </p>

<p>nearest I can tell its pretty close to the sweet spot for total dissolved solids but i dont know how to decipher the other values like ph. </p>

<p>I plan to descale every now and again so mostly I am just curious if this H2O will cause any serious pain. </p>
"
"<p>When brewing by the pour over method (in my case with a Chemex) I've noticed that some ground beans will float when I fill the filter with hot water, and other beans will not float. It's consistent with specific roasts, so I will use two roasts for illustration (leaving out the roaster for now to avoid any prejudices).</p>

<p><em>Roast A</em> will always float when pouring hot water over, throughout the entire brewing process.</p>

<p><em>Roast B</em> will always sink, especially towards the end of brewing.</p>

<p>If I leave the grounds and water undisturbed until all of the water has gone through the filter, <em>roast A</em>'s filter will be coated with the grounds while most of the grounds in <em>roast B</em>'s filter will be flat on the bottom (as you'd expect). </p>

<p>Also of note, <em>roast A</em> has a much more intense <em>bloom</em> after an initial pour of roughly 20g of water into 20g of grounds. It looks like a freshly baked brownie, whereas <em>roast B</em>'s bloom is much less intense.</p>

<p>My question is, what does this say about the beans for them to act one way or the other? My first thought was maybe it had to do with freshness of the roasted bean, but A and B could have the same roast date (less than a week old) and still act as described. Or maybe it's not freshness of the roast but freshness of the bean prior to being roasted? I'm not qualified to hypothesize the chemical reasons for behavior, but hopefully someone here is.</p>
"
"<p>Provided that you descale your machine whenever needed, your machine should not take damage from using tap water.</p>

<p>Since your tap water is also safe to drink, this leaves <strong>taste</strong> as the only reason for concern. Dealing with this question is simple: just make a direct comparison between bottled-water espresso and tap water espresso. Check if you taste any noticeable differences. If this is not the case, the tap water should be fine. While there may be ""guidelines for taste"" as far as the tap water vs. bottled water question is concerned (e.g., softer water is typically better), what tastes good and what does not is a very complex question - so the tasting is the only way to be sure.</p>

<p>Note that you will need to descale your machine from time to time in both cases - so using bottled water to avoid descaling is probably not cost-effective (nor environmental friendly).</p>
"
"<p>Bean density varies dramatically with roast level.  The more roasted a bean is, the less dense it becomes.  My guess would be that less dense beans would have more of a tendency to float and more dense beans would have a tendency to sink.  However, I imagine that there are other factors as well.  Grind size would affect the mass vs surface size of the grounds and have some say as well.  Age could also be a factor since freshly roasted beans still contain/give off some amount of gas.  That degassing time can also vary with roast level and bean variety, so just time since roast may not always be a consistent measure.  Overall I'd guess there are four plus factors affecting the ""float"" of your grounds.  And that's not to even say anything about the content of the water itself. </p>
"
"<p>One thing to keep in mind is that coffee beans contain CO2. This causes grounds to float and foam. If the beans don't have any CO2 they won't float. This is also a sign that they have gone stale.</p>
"
"<p>I remember that I have read a 80 pages long report on the bottled waters in US for brewing coffee in an home type espresso machine. The answer is simply, there is no easy answer if you want to go into the details.</p>

<p>There are at least one hundred ions in drinkable water and each one affects the extraction process during brewing (chemically). So, the answer is the taste.</p>

<p>More importantly, in my opinion, you should take care about your gadgets. Please notice that tap water may cause calcification. </p>
"
"<p>There are many things to consider.</p>

<p>It is not really important whether it is copper or not. (Copper is for tourists in Turkey and generally of bad quality.)</p>

<ul>
<li>I advise you to choose a stainless steel one. If you choose copper, find a real thick copper one.</li>
<li>The thermal capacity... The thermal capacity must be high. It's hard to explain this on text. The cezve must be a bit sturdy. This is all I can say. The copper ones aren't generally sturdy. A bit thicker stainless steel ones are nicer for that. So, you can brew your coffee fast and also homogeneously distribute the heat. This is quite important when preparing your coffee in your own hands. The traditional copper ones are traditional as copper was easier to produce historically. Steel is easier to shape now. So, you can go for steel. An indicator for good thermal capacity is the boiling character of your coffee. If your coffee starts to boil from the edges, then it is possible that the thermal capacity is less than it should be (or the fire is way too strong to brew coffee).</li>
<li>The bottom must be a bit larger than the top. So you can easily keep it on the oven.</li>
<li>The slope I can advice is abut 10 degrees from bottom to top for best brewing.</li>
<li>The height must not be more than 10-15 centimeters to stir the coffee easily.</li>
<li>Take care about right/left-handedness. Some cezves have the option to flow the coffee only on one side.</li>
</ul>

<p>I hope this will help.</p>

<p><em>Here, I'm adding a photo of my own. It is a right-handed stainless steel one. It's thickness is about 1 mm. No slope at all.</em></p>

"<p>I eat roasted coffee beans on occasion, and usually all taste about the same.

"
"<p>I, being a native Turkish and experienced Turkish coffee drinker for my life, quite conservative about this.</p>

<p>There will be some major problems on producing the genuine Turkish-style with a syphon.</p>

<ol>
<li>The extraction process is made by heat, not by pressure in Turkish coffee. So, syphon is not what it is intended for.</li>
<li>Two (or even three) times is quite correct during preparation. But boiling is quite wrong. Never boil Turkish coffee.</li>
<li>A well-prepared Turkish coffee is layered. So, the grounded coffee subside at the bottom of the ""fincan"" (cup). Ideally, it never gets mixed in the drinkable layer of the coffee. (Those remaining grounded coffee is for the fortunetellers.) I assume, by moving coffee in between the chambers of syphon three times, you cannot settle the grounded coffee easily. So, it will fill into your mouth. This is undesirable.</li>

"<p>I bought a bag of Seattle Mountain coffee beans from Costco. Not sure whether it was freshly baked in the store, but I suspect that was the case, since there was a station right beside the coffee section (although I do not really know what that station is for, merely a guess).</p>

<p>The bean is particular shiny. After grinding, it tends to stick together a bit, very loosely though. I have two questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Does the shininess indicate that it is freshly baked? Does it indicate it contains a higher level of some sort of oil?</li>
<li>Since the powder occasionally forms small chunks, does that make the process less efficient when the water running through it? </li>
</ol>
"
"<p>To start, I would highly doubt the beans were roasted there in store.  Roasting at a commercial level takes large specialized equipment that would be dangerous for average customers to be around (400F+ after all) and create a smell that would easily fill the entire store and be unpleasant to some customers.  </p>

<p>That being said, unless there is a roasting date on the bag, there isn't really a way to tell exactly when the beans were roasted.  </p>

<p>The oils on the outside of a bean can mean many things.  Any given bean will generally become more oily and shinier as it is roasted darker and the oils migrate to the outside of the bean.  This is a process that happens near instantaneously with the roasting process.  However, it also continues much more slowly after the roasting process and beans that have been improperly stored or become stale may become more oily than they were immediately after roasting.  However, some processing methods will also produce beans that become more oily earlier in the roast process.  Dry processed coffee will often start to oil at a much lower roast level that coffee processed by current wet methods.  </p>

<p>The oil does not make the process less efficient by any noticeable measure.  Some of the oil is transferred to the paper filter and some ends up in a cup.  Many people claim to prefer metal mesh filters because more of the oil (and flavor) ends up in the cup.  However, other people claim they can't tell the difference.  The oiliness CAN affect the grinding process if the grinding machine is gravity fed and the beans cling to each other or the container too much.  </p>

<p>TL;DR The oil level or sheen of the coffee can't tell you much unless you know other things about the coffee as well.  It doesn't effect the brew process very much either.</p>

"<p>I have been drinking Bulletproof coffee since 2012 now, so made a few of them. Originally I made a BIG mistake of just stirring butter in the coffee with coconut oil or MCT Oil.

<p>What I have found is that <strong>you basically need a high speed blender</strong>. Vitamix or Blendtec are two brand names Dave has suggested.

"<p>As a follow up on <a href=""http://coffee.stackexchange.com/a/2379/277"">this</a> discussion of Turkish preparation, I'm wondering how to do the triple heating. This refers to the repeating sequence of heating the coffee in a cezve, and then letting it cool down.</p>

<p>My question is about both stages:</p>

<ul>
<li>how do I know when it's heated enough to take it off the fire, and</li>
<li>how much should it be cooled down?</li>
</ul>

<p>The guides to brewing Turkish usually discuss that at the abstract level: heat + remove three times. I've been trying to do that, but my actions didn't seem to make sense. So right now I'm brewing it just once -- till the foam starts to rise, and enjoy it. But maybe I still can improve it?</p>
"
"<p>Expanding a bit more on my comment on another answer...</p>

<p>Besides <em>taste of the water itself</em>, the very <em>nature of the water</em> (e.g. minerals and other water factors like pH that was cited by OP) will have an effect on extraction also. That is, different ""water"" will actually <em>extract differently</em>. This is a marginally distinct from a simple sum-of tastes; i.e., taste-of-water plus taste-of-coffee is not necessarily the whole story.</p>

<p>As I suggested before, <strong>try the extreme of bottled water as your comparison: distilled water.</strong> Though not always recommended (for a variety of reasonable and/or dubious reasons; more below) it will be the most stark comparison you can make that is reasonably easy. Holding all other factors as constant as possible, brew with your tap water and with distilled water. See if you can taste any difference; I (personally) don't think I could, but I'll certainly try this also! Play around with it, and enjoy the delicious coffee you make while you experiment. :)</p>

<p>There's interesting (to me) debate about the use of distilled water (and, more broadly, ""what is the best water to use for brewing coffee?""). To your original question, <strong>any water will <em>work</em> for brewing coffee</strong>, but there is debate about what is <em>best</em>. Some warn of ""dangers"" of using distilled water (e.g., metals leaching from the machine, such as in <a href=""http://www.home-barista.com/espresso-machines/dangers-of-distilled-water-in-boilers-fact-or-fiction-t28890.html"" rel=""nofollow"">this discussion on Home-Barista</a>) or some quasi-scientific stuff about partial pressures and minerals in <a href=""http://www.home-barista.com/espresso-machines/dangers-of-distilled-water-in-boilers-fact-or-fiction-t28890.html"" rel=""nofollow"">this article from The Coffee Brewers</a>.</p>

"<p>This answer won't be related to science, but tradition. Still, I think it may help the reader about the roots of both bulletproof coffee and the traditional coffee brewing.</p>

<p>As far as I know, the bulletproof coffee is originated from Tibet (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletproof_Coffee"" rel=""nofollow"">wikipedia</a>). I don't have any knowledge about Tibetan coffee traditions.</p>

<p>However, I know that both in Yemen and in Ethiopia people traditionally prepare their coffee very similar to Turkish-style then from time to time add a bit of butter in it.</p>

<p>Thinking geographically, I am suspicious that Tibet originated coffee may have roots* from this style. Also, Tibetan might be using buttered coffee to keep themselves warm in cold.</p>

<p>(*) I tributed Ethiopia and Yemen for this preparation style as they are the geniune inventors of coffee historically.</p>
"
"<p>I have heard that coffee actually loses caffeine as you roast it, which means darker blends have less caffeine. Why is this?</p>
"
"<p>This is a very common misconception.  Coffee does not lose caffeine as it is roasted.  It is often misunderstood that darker roasts have less caffeine. Caffeine's melting point is 455F which is well above what most beans reach during the roasting process. Essentially, caffeine content changes because the mass/density of the beans change (they lose water and undergo changes in the roasting process). If you measure your coffee by volume, dense greener beans will have more caffeine. If you measure by weight, darker roasted beans will have more caffeine.  The total amount of caffeine in a batch of beans changes very little, if any.</p>

"
"<p>Beans that are sold by giant retailers aren't known for being great.  Most companies moving such a significant amount of coffee (and mostly cheaply) are mainly looking for a supplier who can provide a large volume and quality secondarily.  Dark roasting such beans effectively hides the origin flavors (or lack thereof) and provides a certain level of uniformity (you will consistently get the roast tastes).  It's unlikely the beans are ""burnt leftovers"" since that kind of sorting or sale to another company after over roast accidents would only add to the cost and complexity of getting the product to market.</p>

"<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> <em>This will be a long answer. I expect that it wont be as good as I want at first. I may make corrections/additions afterwards. I am a native Turkish, drinking kgs of coffee each week and from a coffee addicted family for generations. Therefore, I count myself as a Turkish-coffee hobbyist.</em></p>

<p>I believe to understand the two or three times boiling mystery of Turkish coffee, you must understand the whole Turkish-style extraction process. I tell you the whole story.</p>

<p>The chemistry is simple: we are extracting some oils from the beans. Two known ways out there, pressure or heat. Turkish extraction is the traditional, genuine, historical heating way. Actually, it is probably the first and easiest way manhood used in history to prepare coffee (I believe both in Africa and then in Ottoman Empire).</p>

<p>When you heat the beans to extract, you need lots of surface to extract efficiently. That's why you grind the beans as fine as possible. The electrical grinders are not always perfect. You may want to use a mortar after the grinding process to be sure if you don't have a Turkish grinder. (This is another topic, I think.)</p>

<p>Then, the aromatic oils you are trying to extract are not of one kind. There are several kinds. The drink you consume under the name of coffee is delicious if it includes many of them. So, you are trying to jail all of them into the water during the brewing process. But, wait... Some of them start to be released from the bean at 75 degrees Celsius, but some others have been already vaporized at 70 degrees Celsius! There must be a way of collecting all of them.</p>

<p>Bingo! You are right. It is the double (triple, quadruple, ...) heating process.</p>

<p>You should heat the water up to some point, extract a subset of the oils, separate them to your fincan (cup). Then repeat the process at a higher degree. Three times is the best practice among Turks. You may define your own temperature slots and repetition count but I think the algorithm is clear now.</p>

<p><strong>Talking about best practice, let me show you a best practice.</strong></p>

<p>Get you cezve (pot). Mine is stainless steel and thick. Your coffee should not boil on the edges first, it must start to boil from the center. (If this is not the case, either your cezve or your fire is problematic.)</p>

<p><a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/Cr9ZC.jpg""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/Cr9ZC.jpg"" alt=""cezve""></a></p>

<p>If you have a hand grinder, set it to the finest.</p>

<p><a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/7xbZo.jpg""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/7xbZo.jpg"" alt=""hand grinder""></a>
<a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/LPGhB.jpg""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/LPGhB.jpg"" alt=""hand grinder setting""></a></p>

<p>Measure the water with fincan (cup) (I prefer soft spring water) and fill your cezve. Traditional fincans are quite thin (in contrast to espresso cups) and porcelain.</p>

<p><a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/nlZBI.jpg""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/nlZBI.jpg"" alt=""fincan""></a></p>

<p>After you fill in your cezve with water, add coffee on top. About one teaspoon per fincan is quite OK. (You may change). I don't recommend sugar for any kind of coffee, but it is your taste. If you want to add sugar, it is now or never.</p>

<p><a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/Fo8C2.jpg""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/Fo8C2.jpg"" alt=""Floating Turkish coffee""></a></p>

<p>You will see that fine grounded coffee will float and sink in time. Fire up and let the coffee sink by itself. Do not touch or stir. The amount of fire has little or no affect to the taste of Turkish coffee to my experience. There is an urban legend that states that Turkish coffee is best made in wood fire or very slowly in low temperatures, etc. It's nonsense. Then, every aromatic oil will evaporate eventually. You should be quick. These are just romantic/melancholic scenes for old days heard from grandfathers. This was my setting.</p>

<p><a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/njG5o.jpg""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/njG5o.jpg"" alt=""Fire setting for Turkish coffee""></a></p>

<p>After a while, all coffee will eventually sink. This is an indicator. Your coffee is somewhat homogeneously distributed in water. Also you have a nice grease remains already on top of water. However, they cannot form a foam yet. Cause, we didn't stir it.</p>

<p><a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/qMNTQ.jpg""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/qMNTQ.jpg"" alt=""Greasy sunk Turkish coffee""></a></p>

<p>Start stirring.</p>

<p><a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/cDABM.jpg""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/cDABM.jpg"" alt=""Stir the Turkish coffee""></a> </p>

<p>Now, stop. Please check the foam. You have a quite nice foam already. Very very light color. No bubbles at all. It is not mature yet. If you want to be experienced in Turkish-style coffee brewing, look at that foam a lot. Follow its color and forms.</p>

<p><a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/qXRWh.jpg""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/qXRWh.jpg"" alt=""Foam of Turkish coffee""></a></p>

<p>Stir again. For about a minute. Stirring keeps the foam intact. You may stop from time to time to check the color and then continue. It gets mature when you first see the red/fire color.</p>

<p>Check the second image. Could you see the firefox there? Could you? Ok, now it is time for the first shot. Actually, I would like you to compare the second foam image with the one above. Try to figure out the differences. We started with light color, it turned out to red/fire color. We started with no bubbles, it has bubbles now.</p>

<p>We'll pour some of the coffee to our fincans. I pour the foamy part and fill about 2/5 of my fincans.</p>

<p><a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/m9dF5.jpg""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/m9dF5.jpg"" alt=""Stir the Turkish coffee for first heating""></a>

<a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/R5sqx.jpg""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/R5sqx.jpg"" alt=""Filled Turkish coffee fincans after first heating""></a></p>

<p>Still, I have enough foam and lots of oils to extract in my ground beans. I continue to heat and stir. Don't forget to stir and keep foam intact. This time the foam turns from red/fire to brown/coffee-bean-color. Still, I'm very far from boiling. Fill another 2/5 of your fincans. The fincans are nearly full.</p>

<p>I would like to keep your attention to one point. At this point, you see the famous marbled foam of Turkish coffee for the first time. The reason is, you've mixed two different subsets of oils for the first time. Our final destination is to produce a coffee foam marbled with three colors.</p>

<p><a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/Rzz6J.jpg""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/Rzz6J.jpg"" alt=""Marbled foam of Turkish coffee""></a></p>

<p>Now, we hardly have any foam left in our cezve. We are heating the coffee for the last shot. This will be very close to the boiling point. You can hardly see any foam now, but mostly bubbles. At one point, the boiling starts in the middle. Take the cezve out of the fire very quickly to prevent burning the coffee and pour the rest of the coffee to the fincans.</p>

<p>(You really need to be quick, so I couldn't find time to focus and burnt the coffee a bit. Still, you can sense the boiling center. Sorry, for this picture and also I cannot provide a triple marbled foam for now as it burnt.)</p>

"<p>Following a stream of very good discussions about aspects of <a href=""http://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/turkish-coffee"">Turkish coffee</a> preparation, here's a question about coffee selection.</p>

<p>Different brewing methods are thought to highlight different aspects of coffee aroma (e.g., darker roasts for espresso, but lighter for cold brew; see the <a href=""http://coffee.stackexchange.com/q/1562/277"">discussion here</a>). So often when you buy beans at a roastery, there is a recommendation regarding which methods are good for these beans &amp; roast. Thus, a random bag of beans I'm looking at suggests they are good for batch-brew, aeropress, pourover and french press, but not for moka of espresso. But because Turkish isn't a big thing in many countries, it's never mentioned.</p>

<p>May uneducated impression is that Turkish preserves the acidity and keeps bitterness low. Do you guys know what its profile really is?
Alternatively, maybe there is a way to predict the suitability of particular 
beans for Turkish based on its character compared to other methods. E.g., ""beans good for aeropress will often be good for Turkish"", or ""Turkish is the opposite of espresso"", etc.</p>

<p>I mean, I know when I like the coffee I made, so there are some favourites to my taste. But I can't disentangle the factors that contribute to my liking: is it the roast? the altitude? the mouthfeel? Which means I don't know what is more relevant, and this don't have properties to guide me in choosing new beans.</p>
"
"<p>I believe the answer will be subjective. But, I can answer based on some tradition and history.</p>

<p>The coffee beans <em>were</em> originated from Yemen in Ottoman Empire. At least, Yemen was a hub. (This fact is even mentioned in folk songs. See <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFrRS9aNJJQ"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a> and <a href=""https://tr.wikisource.org/wiki/Kahve_yemen&#39;den_gelir-1"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>.) Historically, Robusta beans were not around, yet. Americas were not explored. So, if you want to follow the tradition, stick with African originated Arabica beans. Still, one should note that if you go for the current Turkish commercial ground coffee brands (like Mehmet Efendi, etc.) on the market, most of them include mostly Robusta beans from South America to keep the costs low. This is ugly face of horeca, I assume.</p>

<p><em>(African originated Arabicas are also my personal preference. My favorite is Ethiopian Harar. As far as I experienced, it is even better than Kopi Luwak for Turkish coffee. Also, this may be a hint. Kopi Luwak is known for low acidity. So, low acidity beans were not good for my taste even it was Kopi Luwak. On the other hand, Kopi Luwak was great while brewed with pressure.)</em></p>

<p>For roasting the beans, you generally do not need to burn the beans to eliminate the acidity. So, light roasts are OK for Turkish coffee. Majority of commercial brands prepare City roast and the minority prepare American roast (I think). If you taste burnt flavor in a package, it is clearly over roasted; you must be suspicious about the quality of the beans.</p>

<p><em>(My personal preference is a bit darker than that. City roast to full city roast.)</em></p>

<p><strong>Last words:</strong> I think, as Turkish coffee is just a brewing method, it is up to the drinkers taste either to add sugar/gum/cinnamon/milk or not, either to use Robusta or Arabica, either to roast light or dark. I mean, if the drinkers find it more delicious, they can boil it up for hours (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C4%B1rra"" rel=""nofollow"">It exists!</a>) before drinking. This is about the taste, so no boundaries. :)</p>

"<p>Is there any significant difference between the ideal grinding size for a drip coffee maker and for immersion (boiled) coffee?</p>

<p>When whole beans is not an alternative in a store, you often have the choice between coffee ground for a drip coffee maker, and for immersion (boiled) coffee. Is grind size then important?</p>
"
"<p>I love good strong coffee. To lose flavor is a deal breaker. I tried the gold mesh filter and it is un-acceptable to me. I went back to paper. I was told that because of the screen mesh bottom the permanent filter (like the one I had) has, the hot water doesn't stay with the coffee long enough. It passes right through. Whereas the paper holds it longer, keeps it hotter, and fully brews the coffee to a better taste. The taste is very important to me.</p>
"
"<p>I have always wanted to add espresso to my coffee creations in the morning, but am a novice and don't know where to begin. </p>
"
"<p>It is slightly dependent on your <em>personal</em> definition of espresso. Also the choice depends on how easy you want its operation to be.</p>

<p>The <a href=""http://drinks.seriouseats.com/2011/06/how-to-use-a-moka-pot-stovetop-espresso-tips.html"" rel=""nofollow""><strong>moka pot</strong></a> is certainly the cheapest espresso-type device. However, it doesn't fall within the standards of a true Italian espresso, as pointed out in <a href=""http://%20http://coffee.stackexchange.com/a/298/277"" rel=""nofollow"">this answer</a>. In particular, you won't have any crema.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.wacaco.com/"" rel=""nofollow""><strong>Hand pumps</strong></a> are inexpensive, compact and light, and have the decent pressure of 8 bars. Although they are marketed as an espresso device for camping, they can be use wherever you have hot water.</p>

<p>A step up for home is an <a href=""http://www.aerobie.com/product/aeropress/"" rel=""nofollow""><strong>aeropress</strong></a>. The way it operates is steep + push-filter (as in a French press), and the result ranges from filter-brew-like to espresso-like.</p>

<p>Next in price are probably <strong>the capsule espresso machines</strong> (such as Nespresso and its clones), which many supermarket chains have cheap versions of. Very easy to use, but unsustainable (see <a href=""http://sustainability.stackexchange.com/q/2501/2661"">here</a> and in the end of <a href=""https://www.choice.com.au/food-and-drink/drinks/tea-and-coffee/articles/coffee-capsules"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>), and coffee enthusiasts won't consider them an option because of the taste (see the previous link). For related concerns, see the (excellent) answer to <a href=""http://coffee.stackexchange.com/q/1572/277"">this question</a>.</p>

<p>And then come two best types: <strong>bean-to-cup</strong> and traditional <strong>espresso machines</strong> with a manually operated portafilter. They both are discussed in <a href=""http://coffee.stackexchange.com/a/333/277"">this answer</a>. Both vary in price and quality significantly; probably a decent traditional machine may have a lower starting price than bean-to-cup machine. You may even find one not much more epensive than a capsule machine.</p>

<p>As far as easiness is concerned, capsule and bean-to-cup are obviously easier than moka pots or espresso machines.</p>
"
"<p>Yes.  For a drip coffee maker, most people will want to use a medium grind that balances getting enough extraction and still allowing the water to flow through the coffee grounds.  For immersion (boiled) coffee, you generally want a course grind that will slow extraction somewhat (reduce the chance of over extraction) and make the grounds less likely to end up in the final product.  </p>
"
"<p>I've been trying to find the best grind size to use in my Bruer cold drip setup.
I bought a Breville Smart Grinder Pro (highly recommended).</p>

"
"<p>What is the proper coffee to water ratio for a cold brew? I did mine with 100grams of coffee (an Ethiopian light roast) and a liter of water, and brewed for about 12 hours. It tasted good to me, but my friends said it's too acidic for them, hence I find it acidic in a way that the sweetness is present and with clean finish. </p>
"
"<p>In electric drip coffeemakers, water is pushed up by boiling a portion of it at a time, right? </p>

<p>My friend told me that unless he uses warm of hot water in the coffeemaker tank, the resulting coffee will be much cooler. I find this very hard to believe as I always use cold water and the coffee comes out hot. </p>

<p>All the water will travel past a heating element, and steam ""bubbles"" will push the water on the top where it will ""drip"". BUT is it possible that in cheaper coffeemakers the cold water can slip past the heating element un-heated and travel up with the following bubble, cooling down the outcome? Is this where the watts will really come into play?</p>

<p>I am not asking if cold water should be used, but rather if such a scenario is possible. I do not have a precise thermometer or a cheap coffeemaker to test this. Also, I found this very hard question to google, as the only keywords I can think of are ""cold, water, drip, coffee"".</p>
"
"<p>It depends where you look. When you create the concentrate some people say 1:2, coffee and water, some say 1:1. It really depends on how you like it. </p>
"
"<p>Not sure about your target, but you can try various combinations, until you and your friends find the ""right"" balance.</p>

<p>The coffee-to-water ratio does not influence much acidity, in my experience. Cold-brew coffee is usually more acidic.</p>

<p>You could try another roast. Darker roasts should bring more strength to the taste, and perhaps counter-balance the acidic aspect enough.</p>

<p>As mentioned in answer and comments, it depends on your actual target, and related questions here can give you ideas.</p>
"
"<p>I hardly believe this is directly related to coffee. Still, as a more than 15 year experienced engineer, I would like to answer this question.</p>

<p>The answer is simply and clearly ""no"".</p>

<p>For the water to be able to travel to the top of the drip coffeemaker machine, it requires to gain some latent heat by changing its state to gas phase first. That's It simply means, it needs to be vaporized first.</p>

<p>Then, just at the top of the coffee and filter, there is a condensation space. At that space the gas (vapor) returns back to liquid phase (water) and starts to drip. Therefore, you obtain a slow flow of heated (to the near evaporation point) dripping water.</p>

<p>I cannot think any other way of bypassing this flow. Even in cheaper drip filter coffee makers.</p>

"<p>I drink coffee many time a day; you can say I'm an addict.  Not for a specific reason, I just love the taste.  My family keeps telling me to stop drinking it, but I can't.</p>

"
"<p>The only disadvantage that I see from drinking coffee is that you don't have the time to drink tea!</p>

<p>Oh,  the last cup if coffee is right before bed.</p>

<p>If your family keeps nagging you,  take away their soft drinks and cigarettes,  then let them REALLY complain. </p>
"
"<p>I have a degree in chemical engineering and we do heat transfer and vaporization.  </p>

<p>Yes colder water that goes past the heating element and is not vaporized will have to be heated more. </p>

<p>There is a temperature sensor that will deliver more heat as required.</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COKlObhGt50"" rel=""nofollow"">How it Works: Coffee Maker</a> </p>

<p>Yes cold water will come out colder but colder by 10 degrees going in will be less than 10 degrees difference coming out. </p>

<p>Once it has been on the burner for a while that will determine the equilibrium temperature.  </p>

<p>I had a drip machine that had a temp setting would would indeed deliver hotter coffee.</p>

<p>A good reason to not use hot water is minerals.  Hot water is going to have more minerals from the hot water thank and will contribute to scaling.  Also hot water will have more mineral taste (but you probably would not taste it in coffee).</p>

"<p><strong>Coffee should be fine</strong> (unless you've heard otherwise from your dentist or other health care people of course!). There should be no additional concern about coffee, e.g., its acidity or temperature (other than normal caution). </p>

<p>There are some foods to avoid, but I don't see coffee or anything similar on any list of foods to avoid; here's a few curated lists:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://www.dentalassociates.com/braces-orthodontics/preventing-orthodontics-problems/foods-avoid-braces/"">Dental Associates</a>, a practice in Wisconsin, US</li>
<li><a href=""http://www.oralb.com/embraceit/what-you-can-eat-with-braces"">Oral B</a>, a manufacturer of dental products</li>
</ul>

<p>In general, the recommendations are to avoid hard foods (e.g., crusty bread, ice cubes, popcorn) or sticky foods (e.g., gum, hard candy, caramels), and to be careful of sweets in general (which can promote tooth decay in general but can be more difficult to clean-out with braces.)</p>

<p>If anything, take less sugar with your coffee! Otherwise, continue to enjoy your coffee. </p>

"<p>When frothing cow's milk, if you exceed 150 degrees, you can scald the milk which makes it taste like eggs.</p>

<p>Is there a similar upper temperature for hemp milk?</p>
"
"<p>I would follow the same guidelines as cow milk when using any alternative milk. For one you really just can't taste a liquid that is scalding hot, so you might as well not go so toasty. Other than that - If you think it tastes great, then keep doing that. If it smells less sweet, it probably is less sweet - you just gotta find that perfect sensory sweet spot. I generally aim for about 135F if it's a drink being consumed on site - otherwise about 145 togo.</p>

"<p>I like to eat coffee beans without grinding or brewing them. I just chew it raw, as it is. Is this activity unhealthy?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>

<p>I'm talking about the brown, roasted coffee beans.</p>
"
"<p>No.  Not any substantial ones.</p>

<p>There are several listed questions around the topic of eating coffee beans.  Ingesting roasted coffee beans without grinding/brewing them in some manner is quite common.  Many companies sell them specifically to be consumed this way.  Probably the main associated health risk would be caffeine overdose.  However, it's roughly the same as simply drinking far too much coffee.  The main difference being that since coffee (brewed) takes up so much more volume, you are likely to become physically uncomfortable from it before you could get to dangerous levels.  With coffee beans you could likely get to dangerous levels much easier since it would be possible to eat many more beans before experiencing the same ""fullness"" effect. </p>

"
"<p>Studies come and studies go, and what remains is that it's pretty hard to show any serious health effects from Caffeine or coffee.</p>

<p>It's somewhat ""addictive"" and some people perhaps drink more coffee than is ""good for them"", but I have never seen any credible peer-reviewed evidence published in a legitimate medical journal that stated that Coffee consumption is even possibly related to any long term health problems, that is not offset by at least 3 or 4 studies stating the opposite.  That caffeine is harmful is a minority view, anywhere outside of Utah.</p>

"<p>I once had a cardamom coffee at a mosque,  and I've been trying to recreate it. </p>

<p>I've tried with my cafitierre with no success. Is it possible to do so with my Aeropress? </p>
"
"<p>This question is probably best answered in two directions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>If you feel the need to add sugar to your coffee, it may simply be that the coffee that you are drinking is not very good. Sugar makes a lot of things taste better in addition to the sweetness that it adds. There are many ways to improve the quality of your coffee, like buying better and fresher beans, grinding right before brewing instead of buying pre-ground coffee, etc. Whether any of that is feasible depends on your coffee drinking circumstances - e.g., if you need to use your office's drip coffee machine with the coffee bought by the kitchen management, there is not a lot that you can do.</p></li>
<li><p>If you want to add sweetness because you like it sweet, but you still want to avoid adding sugar for some reason, you can try the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>There are a couple of <strong>coffee bean types that have a slightly sweet flavour</strong>. For example, I have a some ""Starbucks 2015 Christmas Blend Espresso"" here, which is described by the producer by ""Cedar and herbal spiciness with an intense caramelly sweetness"". When using the beans in a pump-driven espresso machine, the espresso indeed has some sweetness. <strong>But don't expect too much.</strong> Coffee is natually low-calorie, which means that there can only be a little bit of sweetness. There are some coffee types that are naturally sweeter than others. According to a book that I have, lightly roasted <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourbon_coffee"" rel=""nofollow"">Arabica Bourbon</a> coffee beans should have a ""fine sweetness"". Panama Volcan Baru Coffee is also listed as particularly sweet. Against, don't expect too much - ""particularly sweet"" means in comparison to other beans!</p></li>
<li><p>In case you prefer to drink your coffee with milk, you may want to switch to lactose-free milk. In that type of milk, the lactose has been split into shorter sugar molecules, which makes the milk taste quite sweet without a noticeable change in calories. </p></li>

"<p>TL/DR: That's the one: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMuDiq-Tvaw"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMuDiq-Tvaw</a></p>

<hr>

<p>I have had the aeropress for a couple of years, but only recently I started trying different methods of making coffee.</p>

<p>I have run several experiments (I didn't document them. hat's off to andy!), and I have read a lot about what really IS an espresso, and how it's made.</p>

<p>So...</p>

<p>First of all, what most people are creating with the aeropress is NOT crema, but foam.
There is only 1 way to create crema, and it needs some extra equipment.
Pressing down REALLY hard !
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIfZ84qtBOc"" rel=""nofollow"">These guys have nailed it.</a></p>

<p>Also <a href=""https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/spressa/spressa-enhance-your-aeropress-experience"" rel=""nofollow"">Spressa Mezzo</a> is probably doing a good job. I can't find it locally though :(</p>

<p>Some science (sorry I lost all the links...): Espresso is defined by making hot water run through tamped ground coffee at around 9 bar pressure. Only then the oils are extracted. The process of extraction generates the crema.</p>

<p>So for aeropress, in order to generate 9 bars, the math tells that you have to press it with 294kg (plus some extra bit that I don't know how to calculate...). Let's call it 300. So you need a lever to do that. And you have to make the lever's math work out because you need as close to 9 bar as possible. More or less will not make an espresso.</p>

<p>That said, what I personally do is this: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMuDiq-Tvaw"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMuDiq-Tvaw</a></p>

<p>It is NOT ""real"" espresso, but I think it's the closest thing you can. And definitely the best method for aeropress.</p>

<p>One last thing: if you don't use a lever, which could actually generate crema (real espresso); don't worry about whether foam is created. It doesn't make a difference.</p>

<p>No... this is the last thing: With said, preferred method, timing doesn't matter. Personally that makes me enjoy more the process.</p>

"<p>What I have seen online suggests that it is what one would think of as severely under roasted (by coffee standards) coffee.  The flavor profile is very different than traditionally roasted coffee and much closer to tea with a lot of bitterness from compounds that are generally roasted off.</p>

"<p>There are some cookie recipes using coffee beans. I've never tried any of them. But I am curious, if eating a cookie has the same effect as drinking coffee?</p>

<p>Or is all of the caffeine lost during the baking?</p>
"
"<p>As I work in growing coffee, many people talk about the markets for different coffees.  While I focus on the sustainability of my coffee, many people have told me that you really want your coffee to be 'special'.  </p>

<p>I have been trying to figure out what this special means.  Some roast their coffee with peanuts or cacao bean for flavor, some claim that because they grow coffee on a very high mountain or an especially cold climate that their coffee is now 'special'.</p>

<p>Are there any objective criteria for specialty coffees?  Which specialties add the most value in terms of price?</p>
"
"<p>No, because there is no fluid in the cookie.  Eating a coffee cookie will have the same effect as eating a roasted coffee bean.  </p>

<p>Virtually no caffeine will be lost during baking, unless you bake hot enough to burn the cookies.  Caffeine's melting point is 460F (237 °C).  That is well above what your cookie will reach internally while in the oven.  </p>
"
"<p>There are not any firm guidelines established for what constitutes a specialty coffee.  Theoretically no one would consider anything made by Folgers to be a specialty coffee, and anything produced by a small local roaster should probably be considered specialty, but there is a lot of gray area in between.  For instance, some people may consider the bagged beans Starbucks sells to be specialty coffee, others (myself included) would not. Specialty is largely a marketing term like ""Cloud"" is for computing.  ""Cloud"" is used ambiguously for private, public, small, large, closed and open platforms.  </p>

<p>Generally I would define specialty coffee as something not produced and sold on a national scale.  Most specialty coffees are not ""branded"" by a company because they are bought in lots and sold sort of ""as is"".  That is, the roaster bought X amount and when they sell through it, it is gone.  This is opposed to a larger company that will always have ""Sumatra Special"" available for sale.</p>

<p>When you start talking about roasting with other things, or adding flavors, you have moved to ""flavored"" coffee, which I personally would never consider specialty coffee.  Oils and additional flavorings may be well liked by many people, but they can also be used to mask the shortcomings of less expensive beans and are generally used to produce a consistent tasting product.  </p>

<p>Lastly when you start talking about growing conditions, it can vary, and doesn't necessarily mean anything.  You can have beans that come from the same lot differ widely even in processing.  There is no ""perfect area"" to grow coffee and good coffee can be grown in a fairly well defined, but still variable conditions.  Advertising that coffee was grown in a specific place doesn't mean it was properly grown, harvested, processed or roasted well.  </p>

"<p>Yes, but not in any significant or noticeable amounts.  Caffeine is stable in solution for quite some time.  Considering a average cup of coffee (~100mg of caffeine), you may lose a few milligrams of caffeine over an extended rest period.  Given that caffeine content varies in any given cup of coffee (many sources list variations as wide as 60mg to 200mg, or more) you are unlikely to notice any difference in the caffeine content.  </p>

<p>What you may notice is a difference in the taste.  They are many suggestions out there on how to cold brew coffee.  It may be worth your time to research an alternate brewing method.</p>

"<p>I have a Bunn coffee brewer with a stainless steel thermal carafe. I have cleaned it, following the instructions in the owner’s manual and the results were surprisingly good.</p>

<p>Place a paper filter in the brew funnel and pour 2 teaspoons of Cascade powder dishwashing detergent into the paper filter. Pour one carafe of cold water into the brewer and brew. Allow carafe to sit for 10-15 minutes. Using a long handled, soft bristled brush, clean the inside of the carafe. Pour out the solution and rinse thoroughly. </p>

<p>The owner’s manual mentions “Cascade” by name. The ingredients in Cascade follow.</p>

<p>Water softeners (complex sodium phosphates and sodium carbonate), cleaning and water spot prevention agents (non-ionic surfactant and chlorine bleach), dishwasher and china protection agents (sodium silicate), processing aid (sodium sulfate), suds control agent and perfume.</p>

"<p>It's a bit of a misnomer. This actually happens in both tea and coffee, you don't really ""burn"" the coffee (or in my experience tea), but excessively high temperatures release chemicals called Tannins that possess a bitter, or ""burnt"" taste. </p>
"
"<p>In addition to all the great answers (most of the burnt flavor is typical for dark, e.g. italian roast) I want mention something I encountered during my time as a bartender: </p>

<p>When having a portafilter (professional espresso machine, as used for cappuccino etc) it sometimes happens that you prepare (e.g. attach the handle with coffee to the machine) and then something comes up and you don't start the extraction process right away. What happens then is that the hot machine heats up the ground coffee. Which in turn results in a burnt taste of the coffee if left unattended for long enough.
My educated guess is that (due to the fact that ground coffee has a very large surface / very small particles) the coffee is burnt/ roasted even further at low temp.</p>

<p>Also note that the water is only 94°C but the metal surroundings do not have to be this ""cold"". As it should be able to maintain the water temperature even if you brew a lot of coffee.</p>

"<p>Dark roasts from an Aeropress easily become too bitter.</p>

<p>I would recommend keeping the water temperature just below boiling. Flip your Aeropress upside down so that you can control the brew time. Add your beans and water, and then brew for 30-45 seconds.</p>

<p>With lighter roasts, I do the above but let them brew much longer. I've found you have to adjust the brew time for darker roasts.</p>

"<p>My intuition tells me the difference in caffeine content will be slight to non-existent between regular shots and ristretto shots. But perhaps I'm not adequately accounting for the reduced volume. And I don't actually know the little details that might contribute to an educated guess.</p>

<p>Which part of the pour has the highest concentration of caffeine? What are the temperature and pressure ranges within which caffeine extraction is most effective? Does the color of the crema indicate anything about the caffeine levels in a single shot?</p>

"<p>Green coffee usually refers to unroasted coffee beans. 
You can make an infusion from them that matches the taste you are describing, with a lot of bitterness and more ""tea-like"" taste. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Green coffee beans are coffee beans that have not yet been roasted. The roasting process of coffee beans reduces amounts of the chemical
  chlorogenic acid. Therefore, green coffee beans have a higher level of
  chlorogenic acid compared to regular, roasted coffee beans.
  Chlorogenic acid in green coffee is thought to have health benefits
  for heart disease, diabetes, weight loss, and others.</p>
  
  <p>Green coffee became popular for weight loss after it was mentioned on
  the Dr. Oz show in 2012. The Dr. Oz show referred to it as “The green
  coffee bean that burns fat fast” and claims that no exercise or diet
  is needed. How does it work? Green coffee beans are coffee beans that
  have not yet been roasted. These coffee beans contain a higher amount
  of the chemical chlorogenic acid. This chemical is thought to have
  health benefits. For high blood pressure it might affect blood vessels
  so that blood pressure is reduced.</p>
  
  <p>For weight loss, chlorogenic acid in green coffee is thought to affect
  how the body handles blood sugar and metabolism.</p>

"<p>There are several coffee varieties that have a ""sweeter"" taster. 
Varieties that have a delicate taste like Rhume Sudan, Geisha, Villa Sarchi, Montecristo, Bourbon, Maragogype will produce a sweeter cup when you apply a softer extraction (like a V60), and you use a light roast and natural or whiney processing. 
However, as stated on another answer, coffee has very low calories and contains very few sugars, beside trace leftovers from the fruit during processing.  So don't expect a strong sweet taster, but rather a very subtle reminder of sweetness. </p>
"
"<p>There is a tea made from coffee, and it's called ""Cascara."" It is not from the actual seed - but instead from the fruit that surrounds the coffee seed before being processed. You can as well steep the leaves from the coffee shrub, although it's a lot less popular than cascara. I really don't think you have coffee that was not roasted - that sounds miserable... </p>
"
"<p>Well first off what is your definition of ristretto? It's very frequently misunderstood to mean simply a short shot of espresso, when really it's all about your coffee to yield ratio. Ristretto styled shots range somewhere in the 1:1 to 1:1.5 range (arguably). For example if you put in 18 grams of coffee, and then yield out 20 grams of espresso (1:1.1)- then you are somewhere in the land of ristretto. </p>

<p>What does this mean as far as caffeine goes? There is no difference at all. Whether you are pulling a normale or a ristretto shot, you still want an extraction somewhere around 20% of the original coffee mass. This means that you are extracting the exact same amount of coffee, but simply putting that into a smaller amount of water.</p>

<p>The other thing to look at is that caffeine is one of the first compounds that is extracted in the extraction process. So even if you decided to pull the shot a bit short and under extract it, you should still have the same caffeine content.</p>

<p>I'm sorry I have no sources or citation. I hope this helps!</p>
"
"<p>A darker coffee will be much more soluble - and extract much faster than a lighter roasted coffee. Coarsen your grind, use a lower water temperature (around 200F or wait about 45 seconds off boil), and use a quicker brew time. I would use a heavier coffee-to-water brew ratio, and extract less than you normally would. Something like 1-parts coffee to 16-parts water (1:16).</p>

<p>If you struggle to find any sort of sweetness from your coffee - then it may simply be too dark and burnt, to which there are no sugars left to develop. </p>

<p>Good luck!</p>
"
"<p>I would not exceed 20 grams on a twenty gram basket. Weird things start to happen. </p>

<p>I would make your grind finer - and simply stop your shot quicker. If it tastes overextracted, then stop your shot even quicker the next time. Adjust accordingly until you get the sweetest shot you possibly can. </p>

<p>Your general espresso recipe for a well roasted coffee should be somewhere around:</p>

<p>20 grams of coffee in
extracted for 26 seconds
A yield of around 30 grams of espresso</p>

<p>I hope this helps and good luck!</p>

"<p>I too used mild soaps, detergents, bleach, vinegar and scrubbing in a double walled 16 oz. stainless coffee cup, yet the coffee stain remained. 
I finally used Cascade powdered dishwasher soap with great success, ending with uncolored stainless and no etching.  I put approx. 1/4-1/2 teaspoon in the cup, fill with hot water, shake mixture and set it overnight with lid on. I recently used a small amount from a Cascade POD of powdered dishwasher soap with the same success.  The Cascade dishwasher liquid detergent does NOT work.  Good luck!  </p>

"<p>I have discovered that for just frothing you can also use a French Coffee Press. Pour in some hot milk so that it at least covers the bottom part or ""filter"" in the press. When you have done that, put in the sliding filter and just start to slide it up and down for 20 times or so. That will froth the milk. Might be enough for you.</p>
"
"<p>When steaming milk with a steam wand, many sources I've found say that the texturing stage of milk frothing can only be done before the milk reaches body temperature, hence why cooling milk and milk jugs is important, as it allows more time for this process.</p>

<p>As an handheld milk frother (such as Aerolatte) needs milk to be heated before it froths, is it possible to produce a good quality micro-foam?</p>
"
"<p>I brew a pot with ~10% vinegar and it cleans everything right up.  A second run of just water is done to help with any residual vinegar.</p>
"
"<p>The good news and bad news about an Aeropress is the number of factors you have total control over during the brew cycle.  Here is a partial list off the top of my head:
1.  Quantity of beans;
2.  Fineness of grind;
3.  Water temperature (Aeropress recommends 185F)
4.  Length of time before pressing;
5.  Right side up or inverted.</p>

<p>There may be more but I've found changing one or more of these variables had a definite effect on the taste.  I could also add freshness of beans but that would be true of any method.  From my experience, water temperature, how fine the beans are ground, and length of time before extraction are the main variables that affect taste.  </p>
"
"<p>It certainly won't compare to a steam wand, but yes you can totally get okay milk texture using one. In all honesty though, I've had better success using a french press. Heat milk via stove stop, put your milk into a clean french press, and push and pull the plunge repeatedly until your milk froths. It's not perfect - but good enough to pour some latte art.</p>
"
"<p>If you own a french press - that's really all you need to froth milk. Heat up your milk on your stove in a pot, add it into a clean french press, and then push and pull the plunger quickly until your milk is frothy. It's not perfect, but the texture is nice.</p>
"
"<p>If you want to stick with your pot and don't want to use an adapter you could also buy a single stove like this one:</p>

"<p>As your question is very open I will try to answer two common roots of your problem.</p>

<p>1) Too much coffee. Per cup of espresso it should be 7g of ground beans.</p>

<p>2) No ""tamping"". You probably did not compress the powder in the porta filter (called tamping). This is what it looks like:</p>

<p><img src=""http://image.shutterstock.com/display_pic_with_logo/3154328/285206732/stock-photo-barista-using-a-tamper-to-press-ground-coffee-into-a-portafilter-285206732.jpg"" alt=""tamping""></p>

"<p>Try Hawaiian Coffee or formerly known as Kona Coffee, it has sweet caramel taste to it.  It's expense at $7- $55 dollars, but make sure it's 100% pure Kona coffee or else it won't taste the same.  </p>

<p>I recommend it, I buy it form the farmers Market from Dekalb County.</p>
"
"<p>It depends. </p>

<p>My office is currently in a temporary building that is powered by a generator. Once a week, they shut off our power to refuel the generator. Every week when the power is out, I make a pot of coffee in our commercial ""drip"" coffee maker and often get weird looks for making coffee with no electricity. This only works because the water overflows out of the tank with the heating element and drips over the coffee grounds. As long as the heating coils are still hot and I use the heated water out of our water dispenser, I get hot coffee out of the machine at 180 to 190 degrees F. Using cold water in this type of coffee maker always results in colder brewed coffee. </p>

<p>For the ""geyser"" type maker, not all the water reaches the point of saturated steam. It is possible for the water to be unevenly heated and the small steam bubbles push liquid up to the top of the coffee maker. The same effect can be achieved with air bubbles in an airlift pump. It is possible to get slightly lower temperature out of one of these makers using cold water. </p>
"
"<p>The way I reduce bitterness is to <em>rinse the grinds before brewing</em>.</p>

<p>I use an electric drip brewer that has a built-in blade grinder with a reusable basket filter. After grinding, I turn off the coffee maker, and transfer the basket to the sink where I spray the grinds with water until the water runs clear (about 5-10 seconds). Then I put the filter back into the coffee maker and start brewing.</p>

<p>I'm not clear on the science behind why this works, but I think it has to do with preventing over-extraction. Basically, the fine powdery bean dust gets rinsed into the sink instead of going into the carafe (where it would continue to brew). This pre-rinse eliminates the oily surface and bitter smell that the coffee has. Plus, I no longer get an upset stomach that unrinsed coffee usually gives me.</p>

<p>If you try this, be aware that it needs to be a mesh filter. Attempting to rinse through a paper filter just creates a big mess.</p>

"<p>I have heard that a ristretto shot is in the realm of 1:1.1-1.5  bean to coffee yield ratio <a href=""http://coffee.stackexchange.com/a/2456"">here</a>. Is the brew time to remain the same? I have used about 25s as a rule of thumb for my espresso shots. If so, the flow of coffee from the machine is very slow, but if not the shot can be completed very quickly. I have tried both preparations and prefer keeping the shot time constant. Is this the prevailing wisdom?</p>

"<p>Civet coffee, also known as Kopi Luwak. </p>

<p>Here are some excerpts from the Wikipedia entry:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>refers to the coffee that includes part-digested coffee cherries eaten and defecated by the Asian palm civet.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>in the coffee industry, kopi luwak is widely regarded as a gimmick or
  novelty item...
  ""general consensus within the industry ... it just tastes bad""</p>

<p>And:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It would appear that the Luwak processing diminishes good acidity and
  flavor and adds smoothness to the body, which is what many people seem
  to note as a positive to the coffee.</p>

<p>The gist of it: The animal is supposed to pick the ripest beans and eat them. So its only getting good ripe beans. The animal partially digested the beans, and that process is supposed to improve the flavor. </p>

"<p>That is almost the opposite of my experience, after opening a bag of beans, they have noticeable less flavour after a couple of days. Coffee beans are more resistant than ground coffee though, as that decays in a couple of hours. Obviously, if beans are exposed to air for long enough, their quality is decreasing.</p>

<p>However there is an effect that improve them at first, simply because some of the processes from the roasting takes time to finish, and may require several days in order to do so. They may even require exposure to air (oxygen) in order to oxidise some of the compounds causing the flavour. Keep in mind that even though <em>some</em> of the compounds improve, other does not. The most notable degradation in the first days is caused by the most volatile aroma compounds evaporating.</p>

<p>This graph shows the stalling of coffee as a function of time. Note that this is just a visualisation of the aroma compounds evaporating, not necessary a measure of quality. The remaining compounds are also changing, and some of them improves over time.</p>

One thing to be careful of is that some coffee grounds increase the <a href=""http://www.gardeningknowhow.com/garden-how-to/soil-fertilizers/diluted-coffee-for-plants.htm"">acidity of the soil</a>. However, I can't find anything indicating that it will affect the flavour of the plant. So, by all means, grow your plants in coffee grounds, but don't expect any difference in flavour.</p>

"<p>Although the way plants digest food is very different to humans, the overall principle is the same: nutrients go in, and are completely broken down into very basic building blocks (amino acids, simple fats and sugars), and then rebuilt into whatever the organism needs.</p>

"<p>A short answer is ""not significantly"", assuming you just store your drink for the day, and there is no sharp changes in storage conditions (strong heat, freeze, etc.)---except warming up the amount you want to drink.</p>

<p>Coffee drinks are unstable, though, and a simple, freshly passed drip coffee tastes different (quality changes) with time. So quality will actually change over a day, although the difference is hard to notice (except people with very acute taste sense).</p>

<p>You are also adding milk, which softens the overall taste, so I think noticing changes in the coffee flavour is even harder.</p>

<hr>

<p>Every vending machine around me (every 100m or so) sells coffee drinks in PET bottles. These bottles are stored for several weeks, and they sell pretty well. They taste fine for that price point and quality, and they are very stable. Of course, they do not include only coffee. They include milk, sugar, and hard-to-spell things. The last category does contain taste stabilizer, etc., so that is unfair comparison.

You could add 3 tsp or a big table spoon if you want a stronger coffee!  But I see that now, they probably would not sell as well.

<p>The problem is that percolation and brewing are not just about coffee: Both terms are generic. Percolation sounds more technical and focusing on liquid getting through a filter. Brewing seems focusing more on ""solid into hot water"", without involving necessarily a filter. This lets me think the words usage can be made quite accurate.</p>

<p>The V60 has a much finer filter than the Chemex, so extraction is much faster through the V60 filter, and more oils/solids come through.</p>

<p>The V60 also has ridges, allowing coffee to easily pass through the filter evenly, rather than all having to exit through the bottom - washing out the grounds in the tip of the filter. The control you have over brewing time is much finer with the V60 as a result.</p>

<p>As for the actual effect on taste, this will depend on the coffee you're using, and how you like it. The main quantitative differences will be the amount of oils and solids in the brew, and a longer brewing time overall. </p>

Chemex is a brand of manual pour-over coffee-making devices and the company that produces same.
"<p>Here's a few more things to add to @fredley's answer.</p>

<p>Since the water is going to be in contact with the grounds for a longer time (1- using greater volume of water, and 2- Chemex filter will be slower) you're going to get more of the bitter notes that you get (in general) by using a longer brewing time. Acidity will be offset somewhat by the bitterness. I find Chemex to be like a filter-coffee version of the body of a French Press preparation, though with no sediment. Compared to the throughput of V60 filters, @fredley hit it on the nose.</p>

<p>Though you are asking about taste specifically, there are other factors.</p>

<p>Like @fredley said, the filter paper in Chemex is <em>much</em> thicker and water drains through it <em>significantly</em> more slowly. You'll probably want to use a coarser grind (and very even grind) than you would for V60 or Melitta-style filters. Fines are the enemy of Chemex, causing the filter to clog and welling (see <a href=""http://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/1658/why-does-the-filtrate-sometimes-well-up-in-the-upper-cone-when-using-the-chemex"">this question about ""welling up"" in a Chemex</a> for more on that). Certainly use the best burr grinder you can and don't delay in the pouring action.</p>

<p>Technique is ""more important"" (read as: ""finicky"") with Chemex, I think, than other pour-over systems. See preparation guides such as from <a href=""http://www.chemexcoffeemaker.com/brewing-product-care-instructions"" rel=""nofollow"">Chemex itself</a>, or <a href=""https://bluebottlecoffee.com/preparation-guides/chemex"" rel=""nofollow"">Blue Bottle</a>, or <a href=""https://www.stumptowncoffee.com/brew-guides/chemex"" rel=""nofollow"">Stumptown</a>, or search for others.</p>

"A grinding machine, often shortened to grinder, is any of various tools or machines used for grinding coffee beans."
"<p>The time could absolutely stay the same for both your ristretto and normale shots. But - for that to happen your grind is certainly going to have to change, and obviously your yield (since you are now pulling a smaller / ristretto shot). </p>

<p>An example:
If you pull a shot that's:</p>

<p>20g in | 25s | 20g out</p>

<p>And then you decide to pull a larger/normale shot, but you want to keep the time constant. Then you are basically forced to loosen your grind to a coarser grind size.
Then you could pull your normale at: </p>

<p>20g in | 25s | 30g out</p>

<p>Hopefully that answers your question!</p>
"
"<p>Honestly, I think you simply just need to coarsen your grind. Also, make sure you align the thick part of the filter (that has more layers) with the spout on the chemex. This just allows air to pass through which helps the percolation. </p>
"
"<p>Yes - you are totally not imaging it. Well, not really anyway.</p>

<p>Mostly the flavor of coffee will either improve or stay the same within the first couple weeks of it's roast date. Coffee should generally degas a bit before brewing &amp; drinking (which it will degas with the bag open or closed). But by opening the bag you will indeed increase the degassing rate, which will change the flavor of the coffee when brewing. Which is a great thing until it starts to get old. I wouldn't take the graph in the other post to heart - it's really not to scale. Most light roasted coffees, and especially africans, may often taste at their peak around 10 days off roast. It's even more present when using them for espresso. </p>
"
"<p>The time is, as mentioned, about four minutes. But as there are so many factors like grind, quality of beans, quality of roast  water temperature and quality and so on. so you have to find out what suits your taste best with your given setup.
But for sure it's good to wait till most of the coffee settled.</p>
"
"<p>It depends on ""where"" the squeaking is coming from. Two contact points that might squeak are <strong><em>the burrs</em></strong> themselves and <strong><em>the top part of the crank rod</em></strong>. The good news is that the whole thing dis-/re-assembles rather easily, and in fact this is pretty much necessary for changing the coarseness setting. I'd suggest two possibilities based on my own Hario manual grinder. </p>

<ul>
<li>If the ceramic burrs are squeaking, <strong>try grinding some very dark-roast beans</strong> (E.g., French roast), which will have more oils on the surface than lighter-roast beans. Use a setting about as coarse as for drip coffee. This will naturally lubricate the bits that are rubbing together, and should reduce or eliminate the squeaking. I wouldn't recommend putting any (other) oil on the burr mechanism.</li>
<li>If the crank is squeaking, take the top part of the crank apart as you would to change the coarseness setting. Remove the coarseness adjustment nut (looks like a toothed gear) completely. <strong>Oil the shaft and the top of the post through which the rod passes</strong>, and make sure the oil is well distributed through the parts where the rod contacts. For the oil, I recommend using a food-grade mineral oil that you are comfortable with. Use a very small amount of oil (like a pinhead size drop in total). I wouldn't use a vegetable oil because it could become ""gummy"" or go rancid, and I wouldn't use anything non food-safe (e.g., not machine oil, not WD-40).</li>

"<p>So my wife and I have a <a href=""http://www.delonghi.com/en-us/products/coffee-and-espresso/coffee-makers/pump-espresso/ec-155-0132104089"" rel=""nofollow"">Delonghi EC155</a> espresso machine that we have used for years.  Lately it's been having a lot of trouble pushing the water through the coffee.  We can hear the pump pumping, but the water just barely drips out.  We end up having to pull it 2 or 3 times to get a full shot (or just wait for the drips to fill up the shot glass).</p>

<p>I opened up this machine once before in the hopes of cleaning it, but found almost everything inside pretty clean and the plumbing is all sealed up.  So I'm a little befuddled as to what to do next.</p>

<p>How do I fix my machine so that the shots come out in a single pull?  I wonder if my pump just can form enough pressure anymore - can I measure the pressure?</p>

<p>A note on the grounds:  We have the grinder set to the finest grind, which comes out like a fine sand.  We've had it this way for a long time and not had any problems.  We fill the basket to about 1/2 full (it's a double shot basket, and we only need one shot - the single shot basket was fed to the garbage disposal years ago) and tamp.  I've been tamping more lightly recently, thinking that the problem was grounds that are too compressed to let the water through.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

"<p>As suggested in comment above, <a href=""https://www.seattlecoffeegear.com/service/tech-tips/descaling-home-espresso-machine"" rel=""nofollow"">descaling</a> or decalcifying your machine may solve your problem. We just run straight distilled white vinegar through ours to do so. Running the machine with distilled water rather than tap water helps keep mineral deposits to a minimum.</p>

<p>Also, running it without water can create an airlock (which makes it take a while for the water to pull through), and allows the pump to spin freely, and so can wreak havoc on, or at least weaken the pump. (I don't know what specific pump is employed by your machine, but <a href=""https://keithspecialty.wordpress.com/2011/04/14/can-i-damage-my-pump-if-i-run-out-of-water/"" rel=""nofollow"">this page</a> may apply.) </p>

<p>Moreover, in the event that the pump has become weakened, it can be helpful to keep the reservoir completely full of water. I do not believe that a normally working machine would be affected too much by the grinding coarseness selected. </p>

<p>Edited to add: While commercial descaling/decalcifying solutions are available (and might work really well) for this application, the staff on a <a href=""https://www.seattlecoffeegear.com/full-circle-single-cup-cleaning-descaling-liquid"" rel=""nofollow"">website</a> selling such reports in the Q&amp;A, ""Breville actually recommends using vinegar to descale their machines while you're under their warranty."" </p>

<p>When deciding what to use, it may be to one's advantage to research whether the product is under warranty, and what the specific manufacturer recommends. Also, take into consideration that the unlisted chemicals that might be found in a given solution could put off foul odors and/or flavors (not that vinegar makes a good perfume, by any means).</p>

<p>P.S.  I just found out that the <a href=""http://www.urnexbrand.com/attachments/FC_Single_Clean_Desc_GB.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">safety data sheet</a> for one descaling liquid contains the following hazard warning (although the company might issue the same warning about vinegar if they sold it): </p>

"<p>The flavor of the coffee will be affected far more by the choice of beans; the roast; the expiration date; the grind; the span of time between grinding and brewing; and last but certainly not least, the brewing method, than by the vessel into which it is put for a short period just prior to drinking it. If you are gearing up for a long car ride, the flavor will degrade somewhat faster in a plastic container, but that wouldn't affect the decision for me. If you've ever been in a Flying J, you probably know that truck drivers almost invariably fill huge plastic mugs with coffee. As far as the caffeine levels, that might be affected slightly (on microscopic levels) depending on how long you keep it in there. The slightly more porous plastic will accumulate infinitesimal quantities of coffee on the sides, which is why plastic typically stains faster than glass or metal. </p>

<p>P.S.  I wouldn't be too worried about health effects  since even super paranoid worry-worts drink from aluminum cans and plastic bottles.</p>

"<p>I learned in a chemistry lab that a paper filter does not ""work"" i.e. ""filter"" if it is not wet. If you put a paper filter in the cone and wet it before putting the coffee in the filter works better as a filter. Do this little test - make coffee with a dry filter and shake out the grounds. You will notice the filter is discoloured and had absorbed some coffee. Wet the filter first and after making coffee shake out the grounds. The filter is not discoloured with coffee. The filter has ""filtered the coffee"" but it has not absorbed some of it in the process. </p>
"
"<p>Adjust the grind. Make it less fine.</p>

<p>Sounds like the pump is not strong enough to push water through the puck.  Rather than set-and-forget on the finest it can do, you should be adjusting the grind constantly: after every shot if it ran longer than 25 seconds (to get 30ml) make the coffee a little bit more coarse, if shorter than 25s then make the coffee a little finer.  Every new batch of coffee beans you'll need to run a couple of shots, and perhaps make big changes, to re-calibrate to the nature of the new beans.</p>

<p>Factors that play into this equation include:</p>

<ul>
<li>how much coffee you put into the basket (more coffee requires a coarser grind)</li>
<li>how hard you tamped it (packing it harder invites a coarser grind)</li>
<li>how fresh the beans are (as they age they dry out, inviting a finer grind as they age)</li>
<li>how oily or dry the beans appear to be ('shiny' roasts tend to invite a coarser grind than ones where the surface of the beans appears light and dry)</li>
<li>humidity (dry air helps the grinder get a fine grind, so dry air invites a coarser grinder setting, humid air invites a finer setting on the grinder)</li>
</ul>

<p>This all assumes there is water in the tank and the filter is clean and clear of course.</p>
"
"<p>The burrs on my Orphan Espresso LIDO E hand grinder touch/contact and grind each other when dialing into a fine grind, even when the basket is empty of beans.</p>

<p>Is this supposed to happen? Are they misaligned? The burrs only contact on one side - particularly only at one section of the handle turn, and I can't get a finer grind because of this.</p>
"
"<p>For the LIDO grinders, burr drag, grinding, or touching is likely due to <strong><em>misalignment</em></strong>.</p>

<p>When I received my Lido E, the burrs would contact each other at anything tighter than +3.5 on the adjustment ring. After careful realignment, I got down to -5 from ""factory-zero"" before any contact - fixing a misalignment of over eight notches! -5 is now my new ""recalibrated zero"".</p>

<p>My burrs are now much better centered than when it arrived, and I can get them extremely close together while keeping them fully free spinning.</p>

<p>It's unlikely that misalignment is due to manufacturing tolerance issues because the burrs are machined. Misalignment is most likely due to errors during <em>assembly</em>. This means you can fix your Orphan Espresso LIDO on your own, with some handiwork and know-how.</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npVWLJnBcAs"" rel=""nofollow"">Orphan Espresso's LIDO Maintenance Video</a> is a detailed guide on how to disassemble, clean, and reassemble your LIDO. He explains one method to approximately realign the burrs, but doesn't go into how to perfectly center the burr.</p>

<p><strong>To Perfectly Align LIDO 2, LIDO 3, or LIDO E Burrs</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Follow <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npVWLJnBcAs?t=6m47s"" rel=""nofollow"">the maintenance video up until 6:45</a>. Do not completely screw in any of the four ""alignment screws"" as he instructs, just yet.</li>
<li>Turn the LIDO right side up and loosen the adjustment ring until the burrs spin freely when the locking ring is locked.</li>
<li>Very lightly tighten all four ""alignment screws"" in opposing X-order (as he does in the video) just until the hopper isn't loose anymore.</li>
<li>Slowly tighten the adjustment ring (and re-lock) bit by bit, turning the handle a full circle and testing for burr contact.</li>
<li>When the first burr contact occurs, note the clock position (e.g. 3 o'clock is the right side, 7 o'clock is the bottom left side, etc).</li>
<li>Slowly tighten the ""alignment screw"" at the same clock position until burr spins freely again (e.g. left screw if burr contacts on left)

<ul>
<li>Sometimes, you may need to loosen the ""alignment screw"" at the opposite clock position to free the burr.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If all alignment screws are as snug as possible without introducing more burr contact, you're done. Otherwise, go back to step 4.</li>
</ol>

<p>If done correctly, the burrs will be so well-centered that when tightening the adjustment ring until first burr contact, the burr contacts in two or more (or all) places at once. The point of first burr contact is your new ""recalibrated zero"".</p>

<p>Addendum:</p>

<p>Because the adjustment screws are tightening the less durable acrylic hopper into metal, it's feasible that imperfections/age/wear makes it so one of the adjustment screws can't be tightened until snug without introducing burr contact. This didn't happen to me, but I suppose if it did, I'd consider adding tiny spacer (tissue paper?) between the hopper and the metal by the loose screw.</p>

"<p>Can someone tell me the difference between a coffee made using the ""normal"" aeropress technique and an inverted technique?</p>

<p>I know it can vary depending on coffee and brew time etc and overall it's down to personal taste. I'm just looking for the basic difference, eg</p>

<p><strong>Normal</strong> is, <em>this</em>, <em>this</em> &amp; <em>this</em>
<strong>Inverted</strong> is <em>this</em> &amp; <em>this</em></p>

"<p>I was wondering (other than the long term saving of not having to buy paper filters), what are the advantages of using a metal filter such as <a href=""http://www.hasbean.co.uk/products/able-disk"">this</a>?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Fuller body cup of coffee</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>But is this something the average Joe would notice or is it marketing spiel?</strong></p>

<p>My main thought would be you would get less of a papery taste, but after rinsing the filter, I can;t say that I've ever noticed the taste of paper from a filter (maybe if I had did an A/B test between the 2 I would?).</p>

<p><strong>Would like to hear any thoughts from people that have one?</strong></p>

"<p>Does coffee increase anxiety? What research has been done on this subject?</p>
"
"<p>It has always been Arabic. However, the World met the coffee you mentioned through Ottoman Empire, a Turkish country. It became Turkish Coffee. Some Turkish stuff is known as Greek too. Let me say, Turkish/Greek delight, Turkish/Greek yoghurt and Turkish/Greek coffee.</p>
"
"<p>I have used both the paper filters and the ""Able"" brand metal AeroPress disk that you linked. They are a bit different, and I use both the metal disk and paper filter based on my mood. To my taste, <strong>the metal disk does produce a ""fuller"" bodied cup</strong> (because more ""stuff"" comes through the filter -- oils and macro-particles or whatever). I believe that ""an average user"" (by my definition) would be able to tell the difference in a side-by-side test, and probably enough to determine preference.</p>

<p>That said, <strong><em>I prefer the paper for a few reasons</em></strong>.</p>

<p>First, the <strong><em>simple convenience</em></strong> is better for me. After brewing, I plunge the filter and spent grounds directly into my compost container. After a quick rinse of the unit, it's clean enough for me.</p>

<p>As for my (personal) taste and preferences, <strong><em>I think the paper produces a better quality and more enjoyable cup.</em></strong> Since the perforations are larger, there is more grit in the output when using the metal disk, so you end up with a (small amount) of ""sludge"" in the bottom of your cup, and it will turn bitter more quickly because of longer contact with the grounds after brewing.</p>

<p>As an aside, I also prefer it for the marginal (and debatable) ""health"" reasons. Paper filters remove some compounds (such as cafestol) that have purported cholesterol-affecting properties. For more of ""my opinion"" on that, see <a href=""http://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/1571/whats-the-difference-between-paper-and-long-lasting-filters"">this question about general comparison between paper and re-usable filters</a> and <a href=""http://coffee.stackexchange.com/a/1578/262"">my answer</a> about the topic in general.</p>

"<p>There's a lot of studies/articles, but when it comes down to it it's just like any other ""drug"": it affects each person differently. I drink almost a pot a day, and have since I was around 17/18, and have no worsened conditions if I don't consume coffee. Some months I go with only a cup a day, and others its ~3-4 cups - and nothing changes drastically. As with anything else, especially ""drugs"", moderation is key. </p>

"<p>You need really finely ground coffee powder, finer than espresso. Most South Indian families (where this filter is primarily used) use a mix of chicory and coffee, but thats really up to you.</p>

<p>Put the coffee in the upper container, the one with the perforations on the bottom. Tamp it down a bit with the plunger and leave the plunger there. </p>

<p>Add just enough water to saturate the grounds (the water temperature should be just below boiling) and let them bloom for about 30 seconds.</p>

<p>Fill up the upper container with the remaining hot water (remember to keep the plunger down), put on the lid and wait for some fresh drip brew to percolate.</p>

<p>This style of coffee is generally mixed with hot full cream milk and then manually frothed by pouring it between two tumblers. I prefer just mixing it with hot water Americano style, but that's up to you.</p>

"<p><strong>Could you roast coffee in an industrial glass kiln and it be drinkable?</strong></p>

<p>A strange question and purely hypothetical. This came about with a discussion with one of my friends who is a glass maker at university.</p>

<p>My first thoughts was that you could not control the temperature enough, however he did state that with glass making, the art is in how fast you can heat and cool down the kiln. So in effect, I don't think the temperature control would be an issue. I feel my issues are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Rotating of the coffee
during the roasting (as it would not be in a drum). It's possible to ""spin"" glass in <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_casting_(mirrors)"" rel=""nofollow"">this
way</a>.</li>
<li>Post roast cooling, would there be a way you could make a makeshift
cooling bed that would be somewhat effective.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong><em>Drinkable</strong> - I guess this depends on personal taste, so for the sake of this exercise I will state that drinkable as the quality of instant coffee. So something you would drink to be polite but not find any pleasure in.</em></p>
"
"<p>If you can run the kiln at sufficiently <strong>low</strong> temperatures and have a solution for stirring the beans, yes you <em>could</em> roast coffee beans.</p>

<p>""Drinkable"" on the other hand is a hard to quantify term.</p>

<p>Ideally, you would roast the raw beans slowy until 200 - 230 C over a time window of 15 - 25 minutes, depending on desired darkness and roast type. 
This allows for a long and slow <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maillard_reaction"" rel=""nofollow"">Maillard reaction</a> and reduces the content of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorogenic_acid"" rel=""nofollow"">chlorogenic acid</a>.<br>
Your extremely hot kiln (""cold"" glass techniques use temperatures over 800C!) woud be even harsher than industrial roasters with their ""90 seconds at 400 C"" method. No time for a good Maillard reaction and reduction of chlorogenic acid.</p>

<p>So while you probably can roast (= darken) the beans in a kiln if you are really quick, the results would lack the aromatic profile desired in good quality roasts and the probability of having just a ""burnt and sour"" brew is extremely high.</p>

"<p>TL;DR: According to <a href=""http://www.seriouseats.com/2014/07/how-to-make-better-french-press-coffee-tips-technique-grind-timing.html"" rel=""nofollow"">this article</a>, you can make better coffee on French Press with a coarse grind and brewing for <strong>6 to 8 minutes</strong>.</p>

<p>Here are the instructions from <a href=""http://www.seriouseats.com/user/profile/nickcho"" rel=""nofollow"">Nick Cho</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
  <li>Start with a very coarse grind, maybe at the coarsest setting on your grinder. The particles should appear somewhere between coarse
  salt and steelcut oats. Take note of your grind size so you can make
  adjustments later: grind a little finer next time if your brew was
  weak, a bit coarser if you're tasting a lot of unpleasant, dish-raggy,
  overextracted flavors.</li>
  </ol>
  
  <p><strong>How much:</strong> While there's a maximum amount that your French press will make, there isn't really a minimum. A good coffee-to-water ratio
  is between 60-70 grams of coffee per liter of water (a mass ratio
  between 1:16 and 1:14). Decide how much brewed coffee you want to make
  and weigh out the right amount of coffee.</p>
  
  <ol start=""2"">
  <li><p>Get your clean (filtered if you need it) brew water ready. With French press, you're good to pour your water right off the boil unless
  you've got an insulated (or double-walled) press, in which case you
  should wait about 30 seconds off of boil. If you're brewing
  dark-roasted coffee or decaf, it's better with water about 10 to 15°F
  lower.</p></li>
  <li><p>Start your clock and add your water. Some people like to add a little water, stir, and add the rest. It really doesn't matter. The
  important part is what you do after you add the water. If you were to
  just sit back and wait out your brew time now, you'd have an
  under-extracted brew, because the release of CO2 gas will cause your
  grounds to rise up and float on top of your water. Remember that first
  phase ""Wetting?"" Well, if you don't have good wetting, you don't have
  much of anything that follows, so you should give your coffee and
  water mix a gentle but thorough stir at about 30 to 45 seconds in.
  You'll know you're good to put the lid on and move on to the next step
  when most of the coffee has sunk and isn't floating anymore.</p></li>
  <li><p>This may be very different from what you've heard before, but bear with me: shoot for a target brew time between <strong>6 and 8 minutes</strong>. ""What?
  I thought it was 3 to 4 minutes!"" you might say. You can brew in 3 to
  4 minutes if you want, but to get good flavor results, you'd be
  grinding a lot finer, and you're not getting the most out of the
  unique qualities of the French press. Give 6 to 8 minutes a try with
  the coarse grind, and see if you can dial that in.</p></li>
  <li><p>When you're ready to stop your brewing, it's time to plunge. So as I've mentioned, French press is a nice, slow, gentle brew. One great
  way to ruin that niceness would be to violently agitate your coffee
  grounds, accelerating extraction right at the end when your coffee has
  already given up the good stuff and the bitter and astringent negative
  flavors are in danger of taking over. Plunge gently. If you feel the
  plunger start to get tight, back it up an inch or two and resume
  plunging. Once you get to the bottom, you're done!</p></li>
  <li><p>If you've plunged your bed down nice and tight, there isn't a lot of brewing that will happen from this point on, but it's still ideal
  to pour off your entire beverage right after plunging to truly stop
  the brewing process.</p></li>

"<p>I have lived in the west of Belgium for a few years. I can say, they are strongly affected by the French culture. However, I am not thoroughly aware of daily French Cappuccino routines, I would like to add my observations from Belgium.</p>

<p>Belgians usually have both options. You can either order your Cappuccino with steamed milk or with whipped cream. If you didn't indicate which one you prefer, it is very probably the whipped cream. If the waiter/waitress is a nice person she/he asks you which one is your preference. So, these were my humble experiences I experienced mostly in the west side of Belgium around 2008-2010.</p>

<p>(I assume the sweet whipped cream idea originates from the topping of the waffles they are used to.)</p>

"<p>I regularly brew my V60 for myself and my girlfriend on the weekends. However today I was wondering if I were to brew 2 separate batches instead one 1 big batch, would I get a less bitter cup? I'm assuming yes, because of the contact time between the water and coffee.</p>

<p>I use the 60g coffee to 1000ml of water ratio. So when I make 2 cups, usually go with 40g of coffee to 666ml of water.</p>

<p><strong>I was wondering would I get a less bitter cup by doing 2 separate brews?</strong></p>
"
"<p>You'll definitely get a less bitter and possibly sour (underextracted) brew when dividing up one 40g dose between two V60s <em>if you don't adjust the grind</em>.</p>

<p>As you point out, the lower contact time of the 20g of grinds will lead to less extraction, and thus less bitterness, and possibly under extraction. This is just a characteristic of pour-over brews (as opposed to immersion brews) - grind size (and uniformity) is directly related to contact time and thus extraction, so the two variables can't be independently manipulated.</p>

"<p>I am a coffee freak and I love Cappuccino. I want to know what exactly is the Original Cappuccino. What portion of milk, water and coffee does it contains? And is cappuccino with more foam as good or with less foam?   </p>

"<p>Numerous studies have found positive health benefits to regular coffee consumption, if done in moderation and without adding a lot of cream and sugar.  Specifically, coffee has the following health benefits:</p>

<p><strong>Huge Source of Antioxidants</strong> - Coffee is the number one source of antioxidants. Antioxidants are important in fighting inflammation, which is linked to arthritis, many types of cancer, cardiovascular disease, etc.</p>

<p><strong>May protect against Type 2 Diabetes</strong> - A number of studies have found that coffee drinkers have a much lower risk of getting Type 2 Diabetes.  One study suggests that the risk of Diabetes drops by 7% for each daily cup of coffee.</p>

<p><strong>May help protect against cognitive decline, Alzheimer's, and Dementia</strong> - Study found that drinking coffee was associated with a 65% decreased risk of Alzheimer's and Dementia.</p>

<p><strong>May lower risk of Parkinson's</strong> - Various studies have concluded that consuming coffee (and specifically, caffeine) are associated with lower incidences of Parkinson's disease.</p>

<p><strong>May lower risk of heart disease</strong> - Study found that moderate coffee drinkers had a 20% lower risk of heart disease vs. non-drinkers, heavy-drinkers, or light-drinkers.</p>

<p><strong>May protect your liver</strong> - Coffee consumption has been linked with decreased risk of liver cancer and Cirrhosis.</p>

<p><strong>Contains essential nutrients</strong> - including Riboflavin (Vitamin B2), Pantothenic Acid (Vitamin B5), Manganese, Potassium, Magnesium, and Niacin (B3).</p>

<p><strong>May lower risk of Depression</strong> - Multiple studies have linked coffee consumption with lower rates of depression.</p>

<p><strong>May lower risk of Gout</strong> - Independent studies suggest that drinking coffee reduces the risk of developing Gout.</p>

<p><strong>Short-term boost in memory, mood, and general cognitive function</strong> - In various studies, caffeine has been shown to provide short-term boosts in memory and cognition.</p>

<p><strong>Can increase fat burning and physical performance</strong> - Caffeine has been shown to increase metabolic rate and adrenaline levels.</p>

<p>But there are some Cons of Drinking Coffee</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The potential health benefits of drinking coffee are exciting news, but that doesn’t mean more is better. For some people, coffee can
  cause irritability, nervousness or anxiety in high doses, and it can
  also impact sleep quality and cause insomnia. In people with
  hypertension, coffee consumption does transiently raise their blood
  pressure–although for no more than several hours–but no correlation
  has been found between coffee drinking and long-term increases in
  blood pressure or the incidence of cardiovascular disease in patients
  with pre-existing hypertension.</p>
  
  <p>Caffeine affects every person differently, so if you experience any
  negative side effects, consider cutting your coffee consumption
  accordingly. It takes about six hours for the effects of caffeine to
  wear off, so limit coffee drinking to early in the day, or switch to
  decaf, which only contains about 2 to 12 mg of caffeine per eight
  ounces. Always taper your coffee consumption gradually. Avoid quitting
  coffee cold turkey; doing so can lead to caffeine withdrawal symptoms
  that may include severe headache, muscle aches and fatigue which can
  last for days.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>To Keep it Healthy</strong>  Skip the fat-filled, sugar-laden coffeehouse beverages and order a basic black coffee. Alternatively, switch to skim milk or unsweetened soy or nut milk.</p>

"<p>Based on my experience, a hand grinder is the absolute quietest that you can buy, but it also take a bit of elbow grease. And if you're shopping for an older parent (like I recently did), then those arthritis hands can't handle that manual grinder. Like others, I did my research on places like <a href=""http://www.quiethomelab.com/best-quiet-coffee-grinders/"" rel=""nofollow"">Quiet Home Lab</a> and Amazon reviews. I also ended up buying the Capresso Infinity for my dad. He seems to enjoy it - and it is quiet compared to his last grinder, so I call that a win!</p>

"<p>I recommend the bialetti. I think thats how its spelled.  Its a stove top device (I suppose you could put it in a fire, too).  It makes some of the BEST homemade coffee Ive ever had. Highly recommended.  Its essentially an espresso machine, I put regular non-espresso coffee in it though. Still awesome.  It's non-electrical, the one I have is no more than a half-pound heavy and about 6 inches tall and 3 or 4 inch diameter base.</p>

"<p>In my office they have a tap with (boiling) hot and cold filtered water system - its designed for hot drinks, and is fine for black tea.  I assume it dispenses at around 100 degrees, though I have not measured it.  The cold tap gives chilled water - I'd assume 5-10 degrees.</p>

<p>I brew my coffee using an aeropress, with about 2 spoons worth of coffee and the standard paper filter. Filled up to a mark between the 2 and 3 marking on the aeropress.</p>

<p>What comes out has a slight metallic, bitter taste.  I do not get this at home where I use a standard kettle (either leave it to boil and cool for a few minutes, or use my new kettle that can specify the temp - I generally use 85-90 degrees)</p>

<p>I have tried to eliminate the problem thus:</p>

<ul>
<li>Different beans (2 different bags of fresh preground ground coffee, with both ""standard for cafetiere grind"" and espresso grinds).  Grinding at work is not an option and doing at home is too annoying.</li>
<li>Different storage (I thought the metal tin I was storing in was imparting bad flavour) - I have now got a glass kilner jar which is air tight and stored in a dark drawer</li>
<li>Washing the paper filter before use (I dont do this at home normally)</li>
<li>Using the inverted method (with the same, or slightly less grounds)</li>
<li>Using another breakout area (with the same system) in case the normal one is broken/dirty/etc</li>
</ul>

<p>None of this makes a difference so I assume it is down likely down to the temperature of the water being too hot.  </p>

<p>What is the best (quickest and least fussy) way of improving my brew?</p>

<p>I have considered (but not yet attempted):</p>

<ol>
<li>Adding a small amount of cold water before adding the hot (approx 1/4 cold to 3/4 hot) then brewing as usual.</li>
<li>Add the hot then add a splash of cold.</li>
<li>Mixing in another cup and adding that - this is undesirable as I already have to carry the coffee jar, aeropress and cup to the kitchen and back.</li>
</ol>

<p>What is the best means to get a better brew?</p>
"
"<p>Is it, by any chance, demineralised/distilled water, with no minerals added back in?</p>

<p>Aside from temperature (which you should check - it's OK if it's cooler, but too cool is no good, and knowing the temperature will help you modify other parameters), it's important to have high quality, odour-free water that is free from impurities and that has the correct mineral content. The SCAA actually specifies water standards (see <a href=""https://www.scaa.org/?page=resources&amp;d=water-standards"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>). In many developed parts of the world, tap water is fine. However, demineralised water is NOT fine. It will underextract.</p>

<p>One solution*: Buy bottled mineral water (like Evian or a cheaper alternative), which usually has too HIGH a mineral content, and blend it with the filtered water from the dispenser. This may seem hard core, but it'd be good as an experiment to see if it cures your woes.</p>

"
"<p>I would highly suggest checking the system which generates the hot water.  Regardless of if it is a storage type or on demand type system, it may require cleaning.  Storing water at temperature has a tendency to cause the contained minerals to accumulate in the container.  If you can take it apart and it is old (more than two years) you may find it has a wealth of accumulated minerals that are imparting ""flavor"" to your coffee.</p>

<p>If the system is not readily available for inspection, you may considered letting some water from it stand/cool and checking to see if the water has some of the flavor you are describing.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>:</p>

<p>Additional information on the chemistry of coffee taste. This is produced by what we know as the Maillard Reaction -  the Maillard Reaction (MRx). Discovered by a French chemist in 1910 the MRx is what is largely responsible for transforming the mere handful of compounds found in green coffee (unroasted) to the complex aromatic beverage that it is today. As temperatures reach 150°C (302°F) the MRx causes free proteins to combine with sugars to form aromatic compounds such as furans which impart sweet, caramel like notes to the coffee. <a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/mWOtZ.jpg"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/mWOtZ.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a>:</p>

<p>More on this chemical reaction  here: <a href=""https://www.coffeechemistry.com/library/coffee-science-publications/unlocking-coffee-s-chemical-composition-part-2"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.coffeechemistry.com/library/coffee-science-publications/unlocking-coffee-s-chemical-composition-part-2</a></p>

"<p><strong>I think you are attempting to brew with water that is way too cold.</strong> To me, this is the elephant in the room in your question.</p>

<p>Though it's only an anecdote (until you measure your water temperature!) I myself measured the ""very hot"" water taps from a filter machine and from a hot water dispenser in my office: one was 75°C and one was 85°C. The latter is actually the hot water dispenser from a coffee-brewing machine. Both of these are way below what I consider to be adequate brewing temperature (~95°C). I did as fair of a measurement as I could: reasonably calibrated instant-read thermometer, pouring water directly from the tap directly over the thermometer into a pre-heated mug.</p>

<p>See <a href=""http://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/2019/what-water-temperature-and-pour-speed-are-best-for-pour-over-method"">this question about pour-over temperatures</a> and links from (full disclosure) my answer there.</p>

<p>It's also striking how quickly water cools: merely traveling through the air when pouring from a vessel can make the water drop a few degrees C. I think you will probably need a separate heating kettle, and I don't think you should ever expect to have to cool off water before brewing.</p>

<p>Or, like I said before in my original comment: measure the temperature and prove me wrong!</p>

"<p>Coffee can be good in many different ways, from</p>

<ul>
<li>Variety, as you point out</li>
<li>Origin</li>
<li>Crop/season</li>
<li>Grading quality</li>
<li>Processing type/quality</li>
<li>Shipping</li>
<li>Storate duration and vehicle</li>
</ul>

<p>Etc etc. </p>

<p>So coffee quality is often measured according to the standards of the CQI (Coffee Quality Institute) that produces the Q grader certification. Graders taste the coffee and score it on many metrics before putting the score as a number between one and one hundred. Traditionally 80+ was considered the threshold for 'specialty' coffee. But there are many, many kinds of coffee that make it to 80+ - all great but in different ways. </p>

"<p>The bitter compounds in coffee are less soluble in water than the other flavor compounds we like, so we can use that to keep the bitterness to a minimum.  In brewing; water temperature, length of contact with the grinds, and fineness of ground are the main factors you can control to keep bitterness to a minimum.  Here are a few explanations that might help:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Hotter water will dissolve all the compounds more quickly, including the bitter ones.  Make sure your water is ""off the boil"", meaning somewhere between 195-205F.  This will mean the bitter notes will dissolve into the brew more slowly.  This is good.  Along these lines, one thing I've discovered is that using less water means the grounds will cool off the water more and they can steep for longer without producing bitterness.  </p></li>
<li><p>Finer ground means more of the bitter compounds are in direct contact with the water so a slightly more coarse grind can reduce bitterness as well, all other things being equal.</p></li>
<li><p>The longer hot water is in contact with the grounds, the more the bitterness will come out.  </p></li>
</ol>

<p>To answer your question directly, just splitting your batch won't help without one of these modifications.  Without seeing your method directly I would offer these suggestions.  </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Take care with your water temperature.</p></li>
<li><p>Consider only pouring a portion of the water over the grounds, like maybe half, to two thirds, then just pouring the rest of the water into the concentrated coffee.  Less water through the coffee.  This is essentially how an AeroPress works.  When I've brewed the same coffee with an AeroPress vs. pour over, the pour over definitely comes out more bitter when I pour all the water through the grounds.</p></li>
<li><p>Try a coarser grind.</p></li>
<li><p>Try a combination of these, such as a slightly coarser grind, pouring only 2/3 of the water through, etc.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>One thing I haven't mentioned is to make sure you're using good coffee beans, not roasted too dark.  The darker the roast, the more bitter the coffee.  I've found French and Italian roasts to be entirely too bitter for my taste.  </p>

"<p>I recently bought a bean-to-cup coffee machine and I drink alot more coffee than I should. As decaffeinated coffee would do me good I was hoping that there was a decaf coffee bean. I would like to use the bean grinding function of my machine but I do not want the caffeine.</p>

"
"<p><strong>There's no strain of coffee bean that has no caffeine when it is grown, but you can find whole-bean, decaffeinated coffee.</strong> ""Decaffeinated"" coffee has been treated to have most of the caffeine removed. Decaffeination is done when the beans are still whole, so you can certainly find whole-bean, decaffeinated coffee (though I suppose decaffeination could also be done after grinding). The decaffeination process is often done with whole, green (not-yet-roasted) beans, which are subsequently roasted (still whole). Most places will sell whole-bean, decaf coffee -- local coffee roasters, coffee shops, markets, mail order from the usual suspects... <a href=""http://store.starbucks.co.uk/decaf-espresso-roast-fairtrade-certified/011037989,en_GB,pd.html?&amp;srule=Featured&amp;start=0&amp;sz=12&amp;cgid=whole-bean&amp;prefn1=decaffeinated&amp;prefv1=decaffeinated"">Starbucks</a>, <a href=""http://www.illy.com/wps/wcm/connect/en/coffee-at-home/whole-bean-coffee"">illy</a>, <a href=""http://www.lavazza.co.uk/uk/at-home/blends/caffe-decaffeinato.html"">Lavazza</a>, <a href=""http://www.peets.com/decaf-house-blend.html"">Peets</a>, ...

<p>The concept of ""half-caf"" coffee has become popular, mixing part decaffeinated beans with part regular (not-decaffeinated) beans, which might be a good option in your case to reduce (but not eliminate) the caffeine. These half-and-half blends are also available from retailers.</p>

"<p>Is it true that if you drink coffee with food, then the coffee would prevent the body absorbing the nutrients contained in the food? </p>
"
"<p>In a collaborative study at Creighton University in Nebraska and the University of Miami, Florida, researchers showed that caffeine may interfere with vitamin D absorption. The results, published in the ""Journal of Steroid Biochemistry and Molecular Biology,"" demonstrated that the higher the level of caffeine, the more it interfered with vitamin D absorption. The study suggested that caffeine did this by reducing the expression of vitamin D receptors on osteoblasts in the body -- the cells responsible for producing bone.</p>

"<p>While I do not own a Smart Grinder Pro, most local places that make cold brew/drip use a medium-fine grind. This picture below can give you a good illustration on how coarse you want your bean.

<p>It is really preference, however, I have found that too fine of a grind (like espresso) will usually muddy up a filter and make it harder to pass through due to the lack of pressure. I am sure there is a setting guide either that comes with the box or online that you can use for drip/cold drip. Just remember to keep it coarse enough so that it does not come out too ""powdery"".</p>

<p>Edit: My recommendation is to use the ""Drip Grind"" coarseness. That means, a grind that is not as powdered down as espresso; grinds should be no larger that ~1-1.5mm in diameter. Usually the finer a grind is, the more pressure is needed to account for the surface area created.</p>
"
"<p>In addition to <a href=""http://coffee.stackexchange.com/a/2469/2089"">Damian's answer</a> (too much coffee or insufficient tamping), have a look at how the portafilter seals onto the group head.

<li>Shower screen is grimed up and has protruding caked coffee on it.</li>

"<p>I have a cheap espresso machine. I grind dark roast beans separately, fill a ""double"" filter with it, run the espresso machine and won't turn it off until my ~250ml cup is completely filled. I drink it right away, brewed coffee style, without adding anything.</p>

<p>It's not Americano (it's got crema all over it), too much water to be espresso, and to my understanding, Long Black is espresso added to water.</p>

<p>Is this simply, regular brewed coffee with crema?</p>
"
"<p>This is called Lungo, Italian for ""Long coffee"". Typically it is prepared around 150 ml.</p>

<p>More info is here: 
<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lungo"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lungo</a></p>
"
"<p>I'd say that it's a caffè crema which is generally made the way you make your coffee and is about 240 ml. It's about 3 times more water than a <em>normale</em>.</p>
"
"<p>I would also go for caffè crema (more water than a lungo). There is no strict agreement on at how much water does it stop being a lungo and starts being a crema. But I guess ""lungo"" is more well known around the world, at least on countries where Nespresso is available, since their capsules for long coffees are called ""lungo"".</p>

<p>Here in Mexico, the waiter / barista might ask you if you want your espresso ""corto"" (short) or ""largo"" (long). Corto is the usual espresso size (not ristretto) and largo is about twice the amount of water. This is not an uncommon practice, but not everyone offers it.</p>

<p>Anyhow, just be careful not to be over-extracting. If your coffee beans can handle that amount of water without over-extraction (which results in excessive bitterness because of burned-down oils, and possibly too much caffeine), great. Some beans do, some don't.</p>

<p>Have you tried a traditional americano (shot of espresso + added hot water)? Compare the flavor between both to get a reference on how a ""normal"" extraction goes on your beans vs. the extended extraction you are currently having.</p>
"
"<p>Your hot water is not the problem - you just need to grind coarser! Especially if you're using a darker roast, which is more soluble and will extract faster. Cooling your water would of course help slow down extraction - but I think the grind is an easier variable to control. </p>
"
"<p>Freezing coffee is fantastic, but only if You do it correctly, and if it's not going to be consumed within the first 2/3 months after the roast date. It's surprising how much fragrance and flavor is kept when done correctly even after sever months past roast. If you freeze coffee - make sure it's as air tight as possible. Ideally you would want to vacuum seal individual packets of coffee, so that the rest of the coffee isn't disturbed once opened. After the coffee has defrosted in the slightest though, it can not be refrozen.

"<p>In the world of coffee, the two terms are basically interchangeable - as long as you are talking about water passing through coffee, and that it is also being passed through some sort of filtration.</p>

<p>Percolation by definition is the extraction of a substance by passing water through it. Your brew time would be the time that your water is in contact with your coffee grounds. I wouldn't ever say my French press's percolation time is 4 minutes, because you never really filter it. But you could talk about any other non full-immersion brew method with either term, even espresso! Espresso is after all filtered, and water percolates through it.</p>

"<p>I've traditionally had coffee with milk, no sugar. However I've recently switched to a diet that involves either reducing milk intake or switching to a milk substitute.</p>

<p>I've been trying to make the switch to black coffee, but I'm finding the tannins (metallic/coppery taste down the sides of my tongue) a little too much to bear. I use a coffee pod machine mostly, but I've also found this problem with espresso black coffee.</p>

<p>I do notice the 'tannic' taste more when the coffee has cooled, but I'm wondering if there are certain types of coffee bean, roast styles, or even serving styles that I could adopt to reduce it without introducing milk back in?</p>

"<p>Soy milk tastes quite different from cow milk. Yet coffee chains seem to make their milk-based drinks from the same coffee pot. The pot is most often made of dark-roast blends ""from the house"", and it seems a good match for cow milk, as the fatty flavour balances the strength of the black drink. Dark-roast blends coffee seems overly strong for soy milk, though, and I am guessing that some cafes do serve ""soy lattes"" based on lighter roasts (from taste, not from observation at this point).</p>

<p>Blends are usually secrets in contents and proportions. The chains use the same pot anyway, but some cafes may be picking a different blend as well, more suitable to the flavour profile of soy milk.</p>

<p>Are there any criteria on the bean and/or roast when one intends to mix with soy milk?</p>

<hr>

<p>Note: This question may seem subjective. The goal is to understand what concrete parameters are ""available"" to make a drink that preserves the coffee qualities and merges nicely with the soy milk flavour profile.</p>
"
"<p>Though it's not primarily your question, my chief problem with soy(a) milk in coffee is with curdling <a href=""http://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/425/how-to-avoid-soya-milk-curdling-in-coffee"">as described in this question</a>. I have noticed curdling especially in higher-acidity coffee -- e.g., especially in American-origin coffees and lighter-roasted coffees. No matter the preparation, I avoid soy milk in anything lighter than full-city roast. The resulting grainy texture is simply unacceptable! Though admittedly certain brands are less likely to split, especially if steamed, frothed, emulsified etc. as in for certain drinks like latte.</p>

<p>Darker-roast coffees are more common (""popular"") <em>in general</em> at mass-market chains, so I think that can also explain some of the prevalence of dark roasts for soy milk.</p>

<p>As for taste, fat content and sugar content vary greatly for soy milk, even when discounting other additives like vanilla or other flavourings... so go for an unsweetened, un-flavoured brand. For my preference, the nuttier taste of soy milk is a good complement for Indonesian or other southeast-Asian coffees, which can be earthy, nutty, toasty, and take to darker-roasting well. Flavour guides <a href=""http://drinks.seriouseats.com/2013/06/coffee-flavor-profiles-major-growing-regions-guatemala-kenya-brazil-ethiopia.html"" rel=""nofollow"">such as this one from Serious Eats</a> can help identify general characteristics. If you like a pairing of soy milk with some other food, look for a coffee that expresses that same characteristic!</p>

"<p>Oh, the famous <em>latte</em>!</p>

<p>Apparently hardly anyone knows that it simply means ""milk"" in Italian, so technically calling a coffee drink ""latte"" is pure nonsense.  </p>

<p>So where does the coffee shop staple get his name from?</p>

<p>In Italy, a <a href=""https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latte_macchiato"" rel=""nofollow"">latte macchiato</a> (""stained milk"") is basically an espresso in a glass of hot (steamed) milk, pouring the espresso last leads to the distinct layers.</p>

<p>A <a href=""https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caffellatte"" rel=""nofollow"">caffellatte</a> (""coffee with milk"") is an espresso or coffee from a moka, topped with a generous dose of hot milk. No layers in this glass.</p>

<p>So depending on whether your coffee shop makes <strong><del>caffel</del>latte</strong> or <strong>latte <del>macchiato</del></strong>, you get milk first or coffee first, layers or none.</p>

"<p>I was in a coffee shop the other day and noticed the barrista was pouring in the hot water before the espresso shot for my Americano. Is there a reason for this?</p>
"
"<p>Coffees prepared with some standard home machines (e.g., non-paper-filtered methods like moka, Turkish, or even some espresso machines) have something on the surface. It looks like oil from the beans.</p>

<p>Filter-based brewing techniques like drip or Aeropress do not result in this oil film on the surface, in my observation. The filter is probably the reason, as it can block the oil and just let water get through.</p>

<p>This oil, if confirmed, is what contains most flavour compounds, so I guess we want to keep it. On the other hand, it is aesthetically nicer to have a clean surface for the coffee drink, which means to act such that this oil is excluded at brewing time.</p>

<p>I am not sure there is a tradeoff here, as ""clean"" surface coffees are very good (if prepared well), which means the flavour compounds did get down to the drink. So perhaps the surface oil is just that does not participate to the flavour. Any information on this topic?</p>
"
"<p>Why do you want to produce crema? Crema tastes quiet terrible if you have ever separated it from an espresso and consumed it. </p>

<p>With that said I don't believe you could ever produce true crema with a Moka pot because you simply can't build enough pressure up to emulsify the insoluble oils in the coffee. </p>

<p>Hope this helps!</p>
"
"<p>Nice question. A similar myth has been arisen for Turkish coffee pot; such as it should be cleaned only with water to keep the greasy surface made with coffee oil.</p>

<p>Partly correct, partly not. According to my ""Barista's manual"" from Lavazza, this sedimented oil may acetify. Thus, end up bad flavor.</p>

<p>Again, (I cannot remember the source) as of my knowledge, paper filters are very good filtering everything; including those valuable oils. (That's why classical French press is still very common to prepare filter coffee, I think.) Paper soak in most of the flavor itself if it does not have proper fibers. This seems like the main problem of any drip coffee machine, V60, Chemex, etc.</p>

<p>Final words: keep it clean in the long run. You may not necessarily clean it until acetifying; which is you may keep it as it is up to one-two days.</p>

<p>Same rule for Turkish coffee pots. :)</p>

"<p>I have a relatively cheap (&lt;£100) espresso machine.

"<p>The amount of oil in your coffee correlates to what is called the ""body""? This is the ""fullness"" that you feel of the coffee in your mouth.

"<p>Can you tell me what makes Brazilian coffee unique?</p>
"
"<p>Actually, Brazilian Coffee is not so unique. According to the book on coffee that I have (from 2014), Brazil is the leading producing country for coffee in terms of <strong>volume</strong> - it produces 35% of the coffee sold worldwide.  The have many different areas of production, which produce a variety of beans (80% Arabica, 20% Robusta), using a variety of different bean processing techniques. Brazil has some regions in which the harvest can be performed by machines, and others where this does not work so well. So in terms of coffee production, they have pretty much every coffee type and preparation type that exists. Given how large the country is, that's not exactly surprising.</p>

<p>If you see a coffee marketed as being from Brazil, this is most likely to distinguish the coffee from the cheaper brands that mix all kinds of coffee from different parts of the world. A lot of specialty beans are actually sold in single-origin packs. </p>

<p>Having said that, my coffee book singles out coffee from the ""Sul De Minas"" region as one where the beans taste have a fine fruity flavor. Also, ""Icatu"" is a brazilian Robusta cross-over variety that has strong flavor. </p>
"
"<p>Brazil is unique in that it is the largest producer of coffee, but it is also unique in that it produces a huge volume of dry processed coffee.  Dry processing is not unheard of, but is much rarer in other countries.</p>

<p>Dry processing produces a coffee that IS different than most other processing methods. The coffee tends to roast differently and also produces much more chaff when roasting.  It also tends to have a different flavor profile than the same coffee processed differently.</p>

<p>Many countries or regions will espouse the benefits of their method of processing, but there are other factors that greatly affect the reasons for choosing a particular method.  High humidity or rainfall areas will generally have a hard time dry processing coffee.  More labor intensive methods may be unfavorable in areas where labor is not had cheaply.  Water intensive methods will be undesirable in frequent drought areas or areas where water is expensive.</p>

<p>Brazil is somewhat synonymous with dry processing.  My roaster has a line on it for ""Brazil"" coffee.  What it really means is dry processed coffee.  Filling the roaster with dry processed beans past the line will overload the unit's ability to get rid of chaff as fast as it is produced and ruin the roast.  But even in the equipment manufacturers world, the two mean the same thing.</p>

"<p>A coffee chain states that its paper napkins are made of ""coffee silver skin"":</p>

<p>The explanation on the right says it is ""coffee bean skin""---the husk.</p>

<p>Searching the internet about it, I can just find about silver skin in meat.</p>

<p>Is there more to know about ""coffee silver skin""? For example, I wonder if all or part of the husk is part of it, and also why the term is ""silver"" (this could be a different question---please comment or ask it yourself).</p>
"
"<p>TL;DR Silver skin is recycled/re-purposed coffee skin also called <em>coffee chaff</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Before coffee beans are roasted they contain about 11% internal
  moisture, if you look at a green (unroasted) coffee bean next to a
  roasted one you will notice the green bean is much smaller and has a
  thin skin, called silverskin or chaff.</p>
  
  <p>The heat of the roasting process converts the internal moisture into
  steam causing the skin to heat up and the bean to expand. When
  roasting is completed the chaff falls off and is removed from the
  roaster. Like coffee, chaff contains a high nitrogen content which
  makes it a valuable product for environmental purposes, and each roast
  produces about 3.2 pounds of chaff. As part of our commitment to
  consciously great coffee we have found a way to recycle the chaff from
  every roast instead of tossing it into the dumpster. Since 2008 we
  have partnered with a company called Reconserve that converts bulk
  food waste materials into animal feed and who’s guiding philosophy is:
  recycle, reprocess, resource conservation. Reconserve picks the chaff
  up from our roasting facility in Sacramento, blends it with other
  bakery byproducts, and produces a feed supplement for dairy cows. We
  currently produce about 4,000 pounds of chaff each month, this means
  since 2008 we have recycled about 320,000 pounds of chaff into feed
  for cattle. We take our commitment to sustainability seriously and
  make sure that we are constantly evaluating every step of our process
  to see where we can make improvements. When you purchase ecoGrounds
  coffees we want you to know you are choosing a high quality coffee
  that has a positive impact on the environment and global community.</p>

"<p>Silver skin is the name generally used when it is still on the green beans.  This thin but tough layer is lightly colored (sometimes similarly to the paper product in your question) and mostly translucent.  It allows the green color of the bean underneath to be seen.  After roasting (when it begins to loosen and fall off) it is more properly called chaff.</p>

<p>Since the paper is likely made of chaff collected from the roasting process (easy to collect since nearly all roasters have a mechanism for separation) is actually an excellent reuse of chaff.  ""Chaff paper"" just doesn't have the same ring since generally chaff is thought to be a byproduct to be discarded.  </p>

<p>The silver skin is the innermost layer of the coffee cherry surrounding the pit/seed (green coffee bean).  It is a tough substance to remove and different processing techniques remove varying amounts (dry process coffee removes the least and dry process coffee produces the most chaff when roasting).  Roasting the coffee both dries the silver skin and causes it to split as the coffee bean expands, so it comes off fairly easily during the roasting process given some agitation.  </p>

"<p>I have the same grinder, and I find that the static builds up more with the amount you grind. For everyday AeroPress use, I don't grind enough per use for it to build up static, but when I cold brew a whole 12oz of coffee, I grind the whole bag in batches. This builds up a lot of static due the the bin being plastic, and it's annoying to clean as it flies all over the counter.</p>

<p><strong>I wouldn't recommend using water</strong> on the beans before grinding because even though the burr grinder is stainless steel, it is not rust-proof. So thinking long term, I would simply recommend keeping the batch size lower than the max line on the plastic bin. I wouldn't use water to clean the steel grinder either. Only use a brush and you can even pre-grind a tiny amount of throw-away grounds to clear the old grounds out.</p>

<p>A clean up is usually in the cards for when I make coffee anyways, and a little bit of grounds isn't going to trip me up, but I share your frustration.</p>
"
"<p>I used to do this for a co-worker and me. We'd use three AeroPress spoonfuls of coffee (which is a lot) to make two cups. I think the theory was that the saturation of that much coffee grounds in the small amount of water that took up what little room was left in the AeroPress chamber, was not efficient at all. So we'd brew the same grounds twice. This made for more bitter coffee, because the coffee was over extracted, and it pulled the tannins into solution.</p>

<p>We opted for simply letting the coffee brew longer and increasing pressure during the press to force extract more out of the grounds. This yielded a much stronger concentrate that we'd then dilute to normal coffee/water proportions. This created a delicious and full cup of coffee every time.  </p>

<p>I think for your case, you'd be brewing hours apart with the same grounds to save money, and I think you totally could. The issue I see is that most caffeine in coffee is extracted within seconds of brew time, so your second brew with those grounds may not yield a nicely drugged cup of joe. So not only will the taste be bitter, but it may also put you to sleep.</p>
"
"<p><a href=""http://chemistry.about.com/od/foodchemistryfaqs/f/Does-Salt-In-Coffee-Reduce-Bitterness.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">Salt can reduce the perception of bitterness.</a>
Sugar-alternatives can help too (stevia, et al.).
But assuming you don't want to add anything to your straight black coffee, I would change what you have control over. Brewing method and coffee.</p>

<p>Cold brewing reduces acids extracted from the coffee, which reduces bitterness. AeroPress brewing extracts less than most other hot methods like a french press.</p>

<p>For coffee, try out light roast or medium roast coffees, as these will have less tannins. You should also try out dry-processed vs wet-processed coffees, as those methods introduce different flavors to the coffee. Most dry-processed coffee will have a more stone fruity flavor due the the sweet cascara fruit flesh drying onto the beans.</p>
"
"<p>The difference can be scoped purely to the side-effects of how the coffee is extracted. You can make up for most deficiencies from either method, by accommodating for it.</p>

<p><strong>Normal</strong> - starts dripping almost immediately, meaning some of the water didn't get a chance to extract.</p>

<p><strong>Inverted</strong> - you can let it brew for as long as you want.</p>

<p><strong>Normal</strong> - grounds fall to the bottom and create a self-filtering layer. This layer allows for proper pressure/extraction/etc.</p>

<p><strong>Inverted</strong> - as you flip and press you may not have allowed enough time for a layer to form and some of the grounds get stuck to the top - solution: after flipping, whirl the water to collect the stuck grounds and then wait a bit before pressing.</p>

<p>Essentially it's not really that Normal vs Inverted affects the taste directly, but rather what you do with that position of the AeroPress is what affects the taste.  Having the AeroPress inverted ensures that you are fully submerging the coffee in water which you can now label full immersion brewing. If you allowed the coffee to drain in ""normal"" orientation, you'd instead be essentially drip brewing at least a small part of the coffee. The effects on the resulting brew could be nominal and undetectable, but if you were to drastically change time/pressure/stirring/agitation/bloom/ratios <em>THAT</em> is when the resulting coffee taste would change.</p>

"<p>I <em>need</em> cream in my coffee. I can only stomach black, when it's excellent, properly brewed and so on. But at work I have no conditions for making excellent coffee - I make do with decent brand instant (lyophilized), I still need cream for it, and I <em>need</em> coffee to work.</p>

<p>And recently I went on a diet. I switched from sugar to stevia, and it's acceptable. But I still use cream for the coffee.</p>

<p>Obviously, the cream awfully cuts into my diet efficiency, so I'd like to switch it to some diet-compliant alternatives that will still make the coffee palatable, not a watered down slop, remain low-calorie and hopefully not cost an arm and a leg (even in spite of how rapidly would <em>that</em> reduce my weight) or require overseas shipping (to Poland).</p>

<p>What are my options?</p>

"<p>I can relate to this. I often home roast, and always do pourovers, so I am used to great coffee. Pretty much the only time I put creamer/etc into coffee is bad coffee.</p>

"
"<p>Good job cutting out the sugar, stevia is a better substitute. As for cream, I would try almond milk / soy milk.

I would experiment with what your palate prefers. Note that these may or may not have more fat content than creamer, so it may taste different. Personally I have switched to plain almond milk, and sometimes vanilla almond milk when I want the more sugary taste with a hint of french vanilla cup in the morning.</p>

"<p>The differences are minor, but there are differences.  When brewing normally, water begins to drip through the paper filter immediately when poured over the grounds.  After stirring I usually have to add more water after the bloom recedes.  Inverted, all the water stays with the grounds until you flip it over and start extracting.  The extra water added with the normal process is hotter, and I believe will tend to over extract bitter notes more easily, not only because of the higher temperature, but by virtue of the added volume of water passing through the grounds.</p>

<p>Inverted, however, the volume of water is less, and because of that, the temperature of that water will be lowered a bit.  You can extract quickly, or wait as long as you want to extract the coffee.  Additionally, I have seen it claimed that with the inverted method, oils that will rise to the top of the column will be forced through the filter first and flavor the coffee more than with the regular method where they tend to get trapped in the grounds.  </p>

<p>I have gone back and forth but always seem to go back to the inverted method. It provides more control of the variables and for me gives a better flavor, even when using the same beans, same roast, same water temperature.  Your mileage may vary of course.   </p>
"
"<p>I've been home roasting for about a year now and you've pretty much got it right.  The bottom line is that home roasting allows much more control over the roasting variables.  But home roasting takes time too, about an hour per pound for my SR500.  It's not high volume by any means but I've found a system that allows me to get consistently really good coffee.  It took awhile but I'm enjoying really fresh quality coffee that exceeds anything I could buy, even ""fresh"" roasted beans.  My former non-coffee drinking wife has also become a recent convert, forcing me to double my roasting output.  </p>

<p>I expect that if I went with a larger roaster, I would have to go through a whole new learning curve though.  I probably ruined a pound of beans before I started getting drinkable coffee, and another pound after that before I hit the sweet spot.  It all really depends on how much you value really top quality taste.  </p>

"<p>Try espresso. The short extraction time accentuates brighter, more acidic tones, and might bring out fruitiness, with less of the bitterness that comes with longer extraction times. The fact that it is brewed quickly and in an enclosed chamber might concentrate more of the aromatics. I'd also suggest a manual italian lever press. They work wonders for light roast.</p>

"<p>It depends on what are you looking for and what you define for ""the best"".
I think that the only way to know that it's looking for reviews and look for the <em>important</em> things for you to consider.</p>

<p>If I was going to buy a drip coffee maker (what I probably wouldn't do because I love brew drip coffee by myself) I would consider things like:</p>

<ul>
<li>Temperature control (ideal T°)</li>
<li>Use of paper filter (to remove oils and body from the coffee)</li>
<li>Water control while brewing (circular motion, inside out)</li>
<li>Bloom </li>
</ul>

<p>I see a drip machine as a replacement to the art of self-brewing, so if a machine can do that as equal as possible, it's going to be good for me. </p>

"<p>I know this is not a standard method of brewing, but cold-press coffee tends to have lighter, fruitier notes. And by fruity, I truly mean fruity. Like nothing you've tasted before.</p>

<p>No heat is added, so you will absolutely reap the benefits of fruity, light notes, while reducing acidity.  The process is heavily explained all over the web, so do a quick search for the proper method. It's very easy, but requires about 12-24 hours to brew. In exchange, you will have a concentrate that can last for a few weeks before it becomes oxidized.</p>

"<p>What is the difference between a typical spice grinder and a specialized coffee grinder?</p>

<p>Is there something that specifically affects the quality of the coffee?</p>

<p>To clarify further, I am talking about the electric grinders with a blade, something like this:</p>

<p><a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/tOl9q.jpg"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/tOl9q.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>
"
"<p>(Note: With a general perspective, you may classify coffee as a spice.)</p>

<p>I imagine you mention the hand grinders. In that case, the main difference is the size of the canals of the grinders. E.g. in a black pepper grinder, the average diameter of the canals are a bit wider than the average diameter of black peppers.</p>

<p>However, this diameter is far narrower for coffee beans. So, you cannot grind coffee in a pepper grinder effectively as the beans cannot fit in the canals.</p>

<p>Summary: proper grinder for proper spice.</p>

<hr>

<p>After Burhan added the image, I think I should make an edition to this answer.</p>

<p>This grinders are called blade grinders. The main disadvantage of these is the grounds are not homogenously grinded after the process. As the blades randomly cut the beans, some of them may stay intact on the sides.</p>

<p>Burr grinders doesn't have this possibility. All grinded pieces have a maximum volume after the process.</p>

<p>Otherwise, I can't think of a difference. However, you shouldn't use the same grinder for both. You don't want the aroma of your coffee to be mixed with spices and herbs. :)</p>

"<p>A customer in the store that i work comes every day and buy this. He called it ""super lugo"". I think it's just a double lugo with extra water (from the grouphead). So you don't loose the taste of the espresso, if you want a kind of filter coffee with espresso taste. </p>

<p>What is this used for? Does it affect the taste or strength of the coffee?</p>
"
"<p>It's a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_press"" rel=""nofollow"">French press</a>.</p>

<p>Put ground coffee inside it, pour hot water, stir a little bit, and then wait for 2 to 4 minutes (or longer if you want a strong and bitter coffee).</p>

<p>After waiting, use the pump to filter the ground from the coffee and pour the coffee into your mug.</p>

<p>I recommend using coarse or medium ground coffee, otherwise, the coffee will go through the filter and will end up in your cup (and mouth).</p>

"<p>I understand that some Asian coffees, like those from Vietnam and Cambodia, are roasted in butter oil. Does anybody know how much of the saturated fat and cholesterol in the butter is absorbed by the coffee and finds its way into the cup?</p>
"
"<p>Since you are already using an AeroPress, I would look for ways to get the flavor you want with the tools you already have.  First, make sure your water isn't too hot.  I've seen recommendations for as low as 185F which is far below boiling.  You would need a thermometer to accurately gauge the temperature, but at the very least make sure the water is well off the boil before you add it.  Second, don't leave the water on the grounds for too long.  The longer the water is brewing, the more bitter notes will be extracted.  Finally, a bit coarser grind might also help.  The usual recommendation is for something slightly finer than what you would use for drip brew.  You might try something slightly more coarse and see how that goes.  </p>

<p>If none of that works, of course you could always switch methods.  Good luck.</p>
"
"<p>Lighter roasts keep more of their single origins nuances, but it's the variety, origin, and wash process that determines what the flavors are. The brewing process is about extraction. The balance of sweet/bitter/tannin/acid/flavors can be affected by your brew process. I find that acids and fruit go hand in hand, and so the perception of the fruit flavors can be enhanced by acids. Doing a cold brew I find is amazing for dark roasts, because it subdues the acids, and the dark chocolate/woody flavors don't work as well with a lot of acids in my opinion. I believe an espresso brings out maximum acidity/brightness for any given coffee, and you get a lot of citrus notes, but that might be too bright to taste the sweet flavors you're looking for. That means you want something in the middle just erring on the side of bright. </p>

<p>I would recommend this: find a Panama (or other central/south American origin) dry-processed (aka ""natural"") and brew it with gentle pressure for sweetness.</p>

<p>Dry-processed/Natural coffees are dried out with fruit flesh on before its removal, which allows the sweetness and flavor of cascara fruit seep into the beans. Washed/Wet-processed coffees have their fruit flesh removed immediately, so they tend to have a cleaner coffee flavor.</p>
"
"<p>To answer your question, it all depends on what oil is used during the process, which can be found by just flipping the label over. Sugar is also used; it is very similar to searing something on a pan so there is no exact way to measure what % of the ingredients you used will be ""absorbed"" into the beans. The oil here is used to glaze the beans, which would then mix consistently when ground and brewed. I would refer to this answer similarly asked under <a href=""http://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/17987/how-to-butter-roast-coffee-in-frying-pan"">Cooking-Exchange</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>....The... beans are generally roasted in what is referred to as ""butter oil"", which may or may not be actual clarified butter oil. Occasionally vegetable oils are used, and historically, traditional ""home-grown"" coffee roasting style involves creating almost a caramel-like coating effect with the use of a small amount of sugar, oil, and generally a touch of vanilla or cocoa. This coating blackens in the roast and the beans wind up with almost a thin, hard shell. Why is this done? Robusta beans are uniquely slow to ripen on the bush, and often pickers pick unripe beans along with ripe beans. The traditional coating gives all the beans a similar color. The presence of a few unripe beans does not hurt the overall taste effect of the blend. However, modern growers pick only ripe beans despite the extra labor, and do not feature this coating in their roasting, opting simple for a little oil to keep the beans easy to turn in the slow roasting process.</p>

"<p>I have been trouble shooting some of my own espresso and realised that my lower-end machine might just be unable to make a better shot due to having a pressurised portafilter. So with that I wanted to find out what real differences having an unpressurised portafilter there are compared with a pressurised one.</p>

<p>For those interested, my current espresso problems are as follows:</p>

<p>I manage to get the grind to a size where I'm noticing good thin mouse tail pours but the lack of thick, golden brown crema makes me think I can get a better shot.</p>

<p>I've read that light coloured crema or thin crema is a symptom of underextraction, depending on the length of the shot (where mine was in and around 20 seconds for a double shot, so relatively fast). I then ground finer and the extraction immediately changed. The mouse tails disappeared and the extraction was fast, almost instantly blonding within a second of the extraction. Liquid was not pouring out extremely fast but in comparison with the slower previous extraction it was relatively fast. I tried to continue to lower the grind size to attempt to slow the extraction but to no avail.</p>

<p>Could this be a problem with the pressurised portafilter?</p>
"
"<p>I think you should get a dedicated coffee grinder. The people who make manual grinders / electronic grinders make it for this purpose. Or else you can have an inconsistent grind.</p>

<p>Plus it's a lot easier to change the type of grind setting on a coffee grinder. If you feel like a french press grind, and you feel that your grind is too fine, just change the setting to your liking. </p>

<p>That way you can experiment with different grinds. I heard different grinds affects the taste of the coffee. Like too fine of grounds going into your french press. </p>

"<p>As of the March 2016 <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_coffee"" rel=""nofollow"">Wikipedia</a> entry, Turkish coffee is a method of preparing unfiltered coffee. Roasted and then finely ground coffee beans are simmered (not boiled) in a pot named <em>cezve</em> (optionally with sugar) and served in a cup where the grounds are allowed to settle.</p>

<p>Turkish coffee is an Intangible Cultural Heritage of Turkey confirmed by <a href=""http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/en/RL/turkish-coffee-culture-and-tradition-00645"" rel=""nofollow"">UNESCO</a>.</p>

<p>This brewing technique is similar to geographically close coffee brewing techniques. Currently, it is found in Eastern Europe, North Africa, the Caucasus, the Balkans, and the Middle East. It may be called Greek, Saudi, Arabic, Jordanian, Cypriot, Bosnian, Syrian coffee.</p>

<p>Turkish coffee is the <em>de facto</em> name for this brewing technique as the Western World's historical encounter with coffee starts with the Ottoman Empire.</p>

All questions related to Turkish-style coffee brewing (and equipment).
"<p>Please do not confuse Arabic coffee with Turkish coffee.</p>

<p>Arabic coffee, called <em>gahwah</em> is something completely different than Turkish coffee ... which is called Turkish coffee in the Middle East.</p>

<p>It has completely different coloration and is also served differently. It is also not sweet.</p>

<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_coffee"" rel=""nofollow"">Wikipedia explains it thus</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Arabic coffee, or ‘‘Al-Qahwa’’ (Arabic: قهوة‎, qahwah, locally gahwah
  or g'hawah), is made from coffee beans roasted very lightly or heavily
  from 165 °C (329 °F) to 210 °C (410 °F) and cardamom, and is a
  traditional beverage in Arabian culture. Traditionally, it is roasted
  on the premises (at home or for special occasions), ground, brewed and
  served in front of guests. It is often served with dates, dried fruit,
  candied fruit or nuts. This brewing method is common in Najd and
  Hijaz, and sometimes other spices like saffron (to give it a golden
  color), cloves, and cinnamon. Some people add a little evaporated milk
  to slightly alter its color; however, this is rare. It is served from
  a special coffee pot called dallah (Arabic: دلة‎) and the coffee cups
  are small with no handle called fenjan. The portions are small,
  covering just the bottom of the cup.</p>

"<p>Pass it to your local authority's electrical recycling scheme, then purchase a new one.</p>

"<p>First of all, note that the smell of the machine itself is unlikely to come from the interior of the parts that heat and transport water -- after all, they are regularly cleaned with hot water and smoke has a hard time getting there.</p>

<p>So running vinegar through the machine won't change that. Rather, it is the other surfaces that cause problems. Thoroughly cleaning <em>all</em> surfaces of the machine may help a little bit (including the easily accessible ones behind the cover), and storing it in a room that is thoroughly aired for some months should also help to some extent. Depending on the temperature, a garage may also be an option. You need to be careful to not break the machine during cleaning and airing, though. </p>

"<p>Actually it depends where you want to use your coffee.</p>

<p>If you are using you coffee in an espresso machine, you may want to prefer a darker roast, maybe Vienna Roast. Just a bit darker than medium. This will keep acidity at lower values.</p>

<p>If you are using French press, your cup will not be as acidic as in espresso. So, to taste the fruity flavors, it is better to roast lighter, somewhere around Light Roast to City Roast may be preferable.</p>

<p>What kind of press do you own...an Aeropress/French Press? Can you post a link to the model? I wouldn't think this would hurt the press.

"<p>The discussion refers to hemp/muslin filters but the pros/cons do not include any experiences with these filters. Just a short note for reference:</p>

<p>In terms of taste, hemp/muslin filters outperform paper and metal/gold filters. </p>

<p>In terms of cleaning up, these are not the most practical, perhaps worse than mesh filters because they need to be rinsed after each use, and on top of that cleaned every now and then with something that is not toxic (I use PBW Cleaning Agent, because I cannot get hold of Oxyclean Free locally, and then rinse it afterwards). </p>

<p>They are not permanent either, but must be replaced; not sure about the costs. They are hard to get in Europe (although they could be made DIY). </p>

"<p>A pressurized portafilter, from what I understand, is a way for an espresso machine that does not provide a high enough amount of pressure (a typical industry grade machine pushes about 9 bars of pressure), and to still be able to emulsify the oils in the coffee - creating crema. First off crema is a terrible interpretation of espresso - use your pallet always! If it's underextracted, you will taste it. Then as you get dialed in, you can use the phases/color of crema to tell you information as it pulls. But with a lower-end machine - a pressurized portafilter is about as good as it gets until you spend more money. Espresso looks beautiful, but looks can often be deceiving. </p>

"<p>Diner coffeemakers like Bunn store water in a tank and keep it hot 24/7, and then run the hot water through the grounds very fast.  Diners like this because they do not have to wait for the water to heat up and the coffee brews fast and stays relatively hot.  But as we all know, this makes the water flat (not to mention calcium build up in the tank) and there is insufficient contact to extract all the flavor from the coffee.  I have tried a Bunn ""diner"" coffeemaker at home and while the coffee comes fast and stays hot, flavor suffers.</p>

"<p>I know that Arabica is a prime quality of coffee whereas Robusta is less and cheaper. At my company, my co-workers and I like a blend of both though. That is why we always buy the best type of both and brew them at the office ourselves</p>
"
"<p>After some time has passed and no one answered, yet. Maybe I can come up with an answer. The question is not clear and if I understood correctly, the answer is too broad. Therefore, I will try to elaborate my answer by summarizing factors that effects <em>the tag</em> of the question.</p>

<p><em>Note: Please leave comments as this is a quite broad answer.</em></p>

<p><strong>The species</strong></p>

<p>When we say coffee, we mention two different species of <em>Coffea</em> Genus. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffea_arabica"" rel=""nofollow"">Coffea arabica</a> and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffea_canephora"" rel=""nofollow"">Coffea canephora</a> (aka robusta). They have many differences. Shortly, Arabica grows in the mountains, more expensive and has more oil (so flavor), less caffeine. Robusta grows in the seaside, less expensive and has less oil (so flavor), more caffeine. More detailed discussion can be followed under <a href=""http://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/116/what-is-the-difference-between-robusta-and-arabica"">this question</a>.</p>

<p><strong>The origin</strong></p>

<p>You grow this plant in different places. Location and cultivation affects the taste. So, the origin has effects on the flavor. You may hear ""Ethiopian arabica"" or ""Indonesian robusta"" quite often.</p>

<p><strong>The blend</strong></p>

<p>So, it comes the blend. After the harvest, the fruits are collected, dried and the beans are picked. When you collect different beans from all over the world, you blend them. Sometimes, single origin beans are used to taste the flavor as it is. Sometimes, they are blended to mix the effect of a variety of beans. Blends may be all arabica, all robusta or mixed.</p>

<p><strong>The Roast</strong></p>

<p>After the blend is prepared, roasting starts. During roasting normally up to 15% of the beans weight is dried out. This process is one of the main decisions based on personal preference, blend structure and the targeted drink. A list of coffee roast varieties can be found <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_roasting"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>. Note that there are also unlisted very very light roasts as in <a href=""http://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/2432/how-to-create-green-coffee"">green coffee</a>.</p>

<p><strong>The grind</strong></p>

<p>Grinding is also closely related to the targeted drink. For example, the coffee must be as fine as powder for preparing Turkish coffee. On the other hand, such fine grinding is so unpractical in French press as the grains could easily travel through the filter.</p>

<p><strong>The Brew</strong></p>

<p>Choose a brewing method. As a subtitle, use proper equipment for that method. Master your brewing method. Needless to say, there are (probably) hundreds of them. I could enlist three main methods as: pressurized extraction, thermal extraction, and cold-brew methods.</p>

<p><strong>The service</strong></p>

<p>According to a questionnaire, baristas in Italy state that even pouring the espresso may affect the flavor. Apart from that, it is a known fact that the espresso cups must be pre-heated for a better experience. So, even serving the coffee is important.</p>

<p><strong>The freshness</strong></p>

<p>As a bonus article to the aforementioned ones, freshness. One should take car of the freshness of the coffee at each step. The beans themselves must not wait for years. After roasting, they should be degassed for two to three days before grinding. However, they should be consumed right after the grinding. There is a famous expression on that: <em>the customer not the espresso must wait</em>. In one experiment it is shown that, if one day old ground coffee is used, the foam volume of espresso is 35% less than the one prepared by freshly ground coffee.</p>
"
"<p>Proper size of cezve matters. Normally, it is ideal to fill up the cezve up to one third to the half of its height before beginning the brewing process. You need the rest of the height during the foaming time. You cannot fill it up to the neck and start brewing. In that case, at the end, when bubbles start to appear, it will spill over.</p>

<p>In Turkey, cezve is usually sold in sets. You can see a set of old style tin-plated copper set of five cezves in the image below. This set includes 1-cup to 5-cup cezves. However, I don't recommend them as the metal is not thick, so the heat is not homogeneously distributed while brewing. A second disadvantage is, tin plating could be worn away in time and copper oxidizes easily. The green colored copper-oxide is quite poisonous.</p>

<p><a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/94ZTc.jpg"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/94ZTc.jpg"" alt=""Old style tin-plated copper set of five cezves""></a></p>

<p>A modern stainless steel cezve set is also shown below. (Image is copied from Hisar cutlery firm's website.) This set includes 2-cup to 4-cup cezves.</p>

<p><a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/K9on3.jpg"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/K9on3.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>As you can see, both sets include different sized cezves for different servings.</p>

<p><em>(A distinct advantage of possessing more than one cezve at home has another advantage: You may prepare Turkish coffee with or without sugar at the same time in two different cezves in case your guest wants to consume a different recipe than yours.)</em></p>

<p>So, I assume I make my point that the size matters and also the count is important. Let's talk about the shape.</p>

<p>Be practical, see inside. Check the spoon for stirring in the second image. You can see its length is ideal for stirring without burning your hand. Your hand will be over the vaporizing coffee most of the time. Find your ideal spoon, together with your cezve.</p>

<p>As it can clearly be seen, the shape is more or less the same. Wider bottom is mostly a result of finding proper balance on top of the stoves for small sized ones. You can see it when you look at them in the sets next to each other. If the bottom is wider, the neck seems narrower. When you have heavier stainless steel cezves, balance is already there, so the bottom is not that wider, thus the neck is not that narrower.</p>

<p>Still, I must admit that, a narrow neck is also related with the foam. The foam is formed by carbon dioxide packed in coffee lipids. When you heat the coffee, the carbon dioxide is extracted together with lipids and cannot be solved after some threshold in water. Those carbon dioxide changes its phase to gas form such as any effervescent, forming bubbles. This is the foam of Turkish coffee. If you try to brew Turkish coffee in a pan, the bubbles will be too far away and cannot survive in the surface of the coffee. They will soon pop and fade away. If they are close together, some irregularities of coffee (such as small particles in the coffee powder) stick on the surface of the bubbles and keep them together. Then, the bubbles form the foam. That's the reason a narrow neck helps to keep the foam.</p>

"<p>I have had some coffee beans for over a year now and the date on them is July 2015. I have been drinking them for the past year because I have a big supply. The coffee still tastes great and I can tell the caffeine still has an effect on me.</p>

<p>Is this bad? I'm storing them at room temperature and I grind and drink the coffee on the same day.</p>
"
"<p>Normally, the main reason that roasted coffee has a shelf life is its freshness. If the package is properly closed it is mostly safe. Your concern should be its flavor which should be faded away already.</p>

<p>However, you must also think about the mold that may cover the beans. Mold may grow on coffee beans or ground coffee in time. It may cause allergic reactions according to <a href=""http://www.healthguideinfo.com/pollen-mold-allergies/p88147/"" rel=""nofollow"">this site</a> or even more. <a href=""http://www.ehow.com/how_7807900_remove-mold-coffee-beans.html"" rel=""nofollow"">This site</a> includes a guide how to remove mold from coffee beans <em>-however this method affects the flavor</em>.</p>

<p>Maybe a physician could be more helpful about the health effects of mold.</p>
"
"<p>In the retail world, ""sell by date"" is very different from ""date of expiration"". With that said. Coffee is a fruit. It is perishable, even after it is roasted and can grow mold. Additionally, if you are using a standard brewer, the brewer itself can be susceptible to <a href=""https://www.consumeraffairs.com/news/are-you-drinking-mold-with-your-coffee-120214.html"" rel=""nofollow"">mold caused by water condensing inside the machine</a>. Unless the coffee has been stored improperly until today (stored in a moist environment with light, exposure to elements, etc.) I would think it would be okay to drink. Coffee is all about taste; to another person, old coffee will taste flat and not have such an aromatic flavor as freshly ground coffee.</p>

<p>If there is visible mold on the coffee, I would not drink/grind it. The best thing to do is always consult your doctor before doing anything.</p>
"
"<p>It is french press coffee. The advantage of it over other brewing methods is it allows more the oils and oil based flavors in the coffee to remain. Drip coffee uses filters that strain out the oil. This is personal preference. If you are trying to avoid fat or if you don't like the flavors a particular coffee's oils impart to the drink you may not like french press coffee, but you could also be one of the people who loves the taste of french press. It can even vary based on the beans. With a french press the coffee should sit for about 4 minutes and then be poured out. If it sits too long it gets very bitter.</p>

"<p>General knowledge tells you that eating a heavy meal will make you drowsy since blood is being redirected for use in the digestion.</p>

<p>At the same time coffee does make you more alert because of some chemical effects.</p>

<p>Can the chemical properties of coffee really overcome the need of blood for the brain to be more active? I think that the blood flow is fundamental to avoid feeling drowsy but whenever I drink coffee after a meal I get really alert and almost feel no post-meal drowsiness.</p>
"
"<p>I am by no means a biochemist/physiologist, but I will give this my best scientific go.</p>

<p>The main reason people get sleepy after eating large meals, ""get the 'itis"" as many call it, simply has to do with homeostasis. The average person's diet usually consists mostly of carbohydrates. Carbs, especially when eaten in large quantities, causes a large spike in our blood sugar. In order for your body to bring the sugar levels back down to normal, the body releases insulin. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This stimulates movement of tryptophan (an amino acid in the brain), which then leads to the increased production of serotonin, a neurotransmitter responsible for sleep. And this increased level of serotonin triggers sleepiness after a meal. - See more at: <a href=""http://blog.zocdoc.com/get-sleepy-meal-weird-science-daily-life/#sthash.fseXW9aA.dpuf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.zocdoc.com/get-sleepy-meal-weird-science-daily-life/#sthash.fseXW9aA.dpuf</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dangerously enough, constant spiking and falling of the blood sugar levels in the human body can lead to T2 Diabetes (most associated with processed sugars).</p>

<p>Tryphtophan is the same amino that is found abundantly in turkey may be why some people take snoozes after large Thanksgiving day meals!</p>

<p>Now, this brings us to the coffee portion. Coffee has caffeine which is a CNS stimulant. It increases blood pressure, metabolism, causes natriuresis (increase in saline secretion), but most obviously, may cause jitteriness, mild anxiety and alertness.</p>

<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caffeine#Pharmacodynamics"" rel=""nofollow"">This is because when caffeine is consumed, it antagonizes adenosine receptors; in other words, caffeine prevents adenosine from activating the receptor by blocking the location on the receptor where adenosine binds to it. As a result, caffeine temporarily prevents or relieves drowsiness, and thus maintains or restores alertness.</a></p>

<p><strong>It is not the blood in your body that affects sleepiness/alertness, rather the neurotransmitters and their chemical synapses</strong>
<a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/r7mcd.png"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/r7mcd.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> After eating, your body is naturally producing neurotransmitters to bring your body to a state of homeostasis. When you ingest coffee, which contains caffeine, it counteracts this and keeps you awake and alert.</p>

"<p>If you slowly press the plunger of a french press down will you get a stronger flavor in contrast to plunging rapidly? Does the speed of plunging affect anything?</p>

"<p>Speed of the plunger does not affect the flavor.</p>

<ul>
<li>the temperature of the water</li>
<li>the duration of brewing</li>
<li>the water quality</li>

<p>However, speed of plunger may be important in this case: if you push the plunger rapidly, the flow of water push the grounds from the sides of the filter. Thus, the grounds will probably mix with the final cup of coffee. Even worse, the hot water may splash in your hand or face.</p>

<p>Caffeine is mainly used to boost awareness and caffeine can be found in a variety of drinks. Caffeine alone is very effective at perking a person up but if paired with sugar this can have a double ""energy effect since the sugar will also increase energy levels...but sugar will also cause a ""sugar crash"" (that is another topic, regarding insulin/glucose levels in the blood.)</p>

<p>So lets say you don't drink large doses of caffeine on a regular basis and you want to try and drink this famous ""cup of Joe"" from Starbucks, what could go wrong? well it all depends on your caffeine tolerance. Just like a habitual user of nicotine or other stimulating drugs will be affected differently, a caffein user will tolerate different levels of a cup of joe depending on their weight, liver function to metabolize the caffeine and how much water you drink + kidney function. </p>

<p>Caffeine is a drug:</p>

<p>Caffeine is no more different than nicotine or cocaine, Why? because caffeine is considered a stimulant very much like nicotine and cocaine, it produces very similar effects thus some of the side effects may be similar as well. Also, caffeine is habit forming and a person can become dependent or addicted to it, resulting in withdrawal symptoms when coming off it.</p>

<p><em>Caffeine is a central nervous system (CNS) stimulant of the methylxanthine class.[10] It is the world's most widely consumed psychoactive drug, but — unlike many other psychoactive substances — it is legal and unregulated in nearly all parts of the world. There are several known mechanisms of action to explain the effects of caffeine. The most prominent is that it reversibly blocks the action of adenosine on its receptor and consequently prevents the onset of drowsiness induced by adenosine. Caffeine also stimulates certain portions of the autonomic nervous system.</em> <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caffeine"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caffeine</a></p>

<p><em>Nicotine acts as both a stimulant and a sedative. Immediately after exposure to nicotine, there is a ""kick"" caused in part by the drug's stimulation of the adrenal glands and resulting discharge of epinephrine (adrenaline). The rush of adrenaline stimulates the body, causing a sudden release of glucose as well as an increase in blood pressure, heart rate and respiration. Nicotine also suppresses insulin output from the pancreas, causing smokers to be slightly hyperglycemic. In addition, nicotine indirectly causes a release of dopamine in the brain regions that control pleasure and motivation. This reaction is similar to that seen with other abused drugs—such as cocaine and heroin—and is thought to underlie the pleasurable sensations many smokers experience. In contrast, nicotine can also exert a sedative effect, depending on the level of the smoker's nervous system arousal and the dose of nicotine taken.</em>

"<p>I've tried using coffee grounds twice and obviously there is a quality and potency difference, if you just really want to stretch your coffee more than you can use less coffee per cup or if you are like me and just like the feeling of having a warm cup then reuse the coffee grounds twice but the second time around it better to brew it twice as long.</p>

"<p>Based on the article <a href=""http://legacy.sweetmarias.com/library/content/caffeine-health-and-eco-concerns"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a> and some brief experience with roasting decaf myself, I'd agree that the methylene chloride method seems to produce more flavorful beans.  That being said it's hard to make a direct comparison due to the difficulties in getting a single batch of beans and getting them processed for decaf at multiple facilities.  I think your best bet is to find a green coffee seller that you trust and see what they have to offer.</p>
"
"<p>The short answer is no.  Short of genetic testing, it is near impossible to determine the origin of beans.  </p>

<p>You may be able to make an educated guess at the whether or not Robusta beans are in the blend based the shapes of the beans and caffeine content.  But that would require a trained eye as as there is a great amount of variation in beans and it might be possible to mix up robusta, natural peaberrys, etc.  Robusta will raise the caffeine content, but depending on the blended amount, it may be hard to detect.</p>

<p>Sleeping trouble</p>

<p>Vomiting</p>

<p>these are not all the symptoms as stated in the article, Also if we take in consideration that caffeine is a vasoconstrictor (makes your veins and arteries squeeze together) this increases pressure in the circulatory system causing your blood pressure to increase and heart rate to go up.</p>

<p>We can sit here and go on an on with articles or references, case in point, if you do not suffer from any medical conditions and are considered to be a healthy individual you can try and drink this famous cup of coffee but it would probably be best if you spaced it out and don't just down the whole cup right there on the spot. The most immediate effects you will most likely encounter is the increased heart rate and the nervousness then possible GI upset. after that you are putting your self at risk if you keep going,</p>

<p>The caffeine amounts of the espresso-based drinks show that a Tall Latte (and Cappuccino) has just a single shot of coffee. For a 12 oz cup size – this is quite weak and has considerably less caffeine than a brewed coffee of the same size</p>

<p>according to Mayo Clinic:
Up to 400 milligrams (mg) of caffeine a day appears to be safe for most healthy adults. That's roughly the amount of caffeine in four cups of brewed coffee, 10 cans of cola or two ""energy shot"" drinks. Although caffeine use may be safe for adults, it's not a good idea for children.</p>
"
"<p>Pressurized portafilters either restrict water flow or require a certain buildup of pressure before the espresso spills out the bottom of the portafilter. </p>

<p>So there are several problems with that taste-wise in espresso. The resistance is now not in the ground coffee itself, but below it. Additionally, if your coffee is ground finely and uniformly in a good espresso grinder (as one would for a non-pressurized portafilter), this sort of portafilter will result in too much resistance and thus a slow, over-extracted shot. It can also make your crema look a bit odd because it can emulsify some of the oils in your extracted shot (depending on the design of the specific portafilter).</p>

<p>Essentially the requisite grind size to produce acceptable espresso using a pressurized portafilter is much larger than that of optimal or delicious espresso.</p>

<p>This sort of portafilter does have its upsides, though. If you don't have access to a quality espresso grinder, and you are using either store-ground beans or imprecisely/more coarsely ground beans, a pressurized portafilter can make acceptable espresso from them whereas the results in a standard portafilter would be very watery and underextracted.</p>

"<p>I'm not really sure what you're asking here. Bitterness in coffee can come from many sources, the quality of bean, the roast, whether or not you've burned it, etc. Sugar can reduce this bitterness by triggering other taste buds on your tongue.</p>

<p>However, if you really want to cut the bitterness in coffee, <a href=""http://altonbrown.com/how-to-brew-best-cup-of-coffee-at-home/"" rel=""nofollow"">just add the tiniest bit of salt (according to Alton Brown)</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Salt and Coffee:</strong> Not only does salt cut the bitterness of coffee, but it also smooths out the “stale” taste of tank-stored water. I’ve taken to adding a quarter teaspoon of kosher salt to every 6 tablespoons of grounds. That isn’t really enough to taste, but it’ll do the trick. And by the way, research has proven that salt is actually better at neutralizing bitterness than sugar.</p>

"<p>If you are asking whether the science can be trusted, I would say yes.  The effect is already well known.  You even understand it insomuch as you apparently don't drink more concentrated brews (espresso, aerpresso) without a ""masking"" agent. </p>

<p>All this study is doing is finding a more specific reason for the already acknowledged effect.  People commonly believe that sugar or salt ""masks"" the bitterness from caffeine.

"<p><strong>Why is coffee always made with hot water ?</strong></p>

<p>I know there is iced coffee, but even in this case, coffee must be made with boiled water before.</p>

<p>My simple coffee machine heats water into vapor, then rises it to the top of the machine to fill the filter and turns to coffee. It's obvious that it's impossible to do this with cold water and a traditional machine. But if it was, would the taste be the same as of a cooled traditional coffee ?</p>
"
"<p>Let's take a look at what turns coffee grounds and water into coffee:</p>

<p>It's an extraction process where aromatic compounds and oils and caffeine are extracted from the coffee bean into the water. It's a ""standard chemical process"", done in millions of kitchens and cafés all over the world.</p>

<p>Basic chemistry will tell you that the temperature of the solvent and other environmental parameters like pressure typically determine how fast this happens, but also the ratios of extracted substances, if applicable. Surface area comes into play as well, that's why e.g. coffee for espresso machines is ground finer than for filter machines. Using the same batch of beans in an espresso machine and a drip coffee maker gives you two <em>totally different</em> taste profiles.</p>

<p>The same applies for extraction processes that use <strong>cold water</strong>, a method termed ""cold brew"" and <a href=""http://coffee.stackexchange.com/search?q=Cold%20brew"">discussed on this site</a> as well. By the same rules as explained before, this means you need significantly longer extraction times (we are talking <em>hours</em> here) and should expect a different taste.</p>

"<p>You're going to have to understand the market of the local area of where you intend to have your coffee shop.

<p>An unfortunate observation of mine is that it seems as though there is a majority of people who do not actually know what a good cup of coffee is like nor do they care; it's all about the caffeine fix or the environment of the shop itself.

"<p>How do I brew a good cup of coffee with lower acidity? I want to continue drinking coffee, but the acidity is getting to me. Is their any way to brew coffee so that it isn't so acidic?</p>
"
"<p>I find approximately 3 to 4 days. It all depends on the bean and the roast level it's important how you store your beans store cool dark area</p>
"
"<p>I'm sure it's possible. I myself feel the effect of chewing on a single bean.</p>

<p>The reason has to do with the different way we absorb caffeine when chewed rather than brewed.</p>

<p>When drinking coffee, the caffeine has to be digested and absorbed through your stomach lining, duodenum, or small intestine (I'm not sure which.)</p>

<p>On the other hand, when chewing on a bean, the caffeine is directly absorbed by your mouth into the bloodstream. Therefore even a single bean, which may have 1/10 or less caffeine than a cup, will give you a boost. It will give it sooner, usually while you're still chewing on it, but it will go away sooner too. (Unless you eat a large number of beans. Don't do that.)</p>
"
"<p>There are at least three ways to reduce acidity.</p>

<p>One way is to roast the beans more, to a dark level. I think that is the main way if you want to stick with your beans. This is inline with <a href=""http://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/2570/how-best-to-reduce-tannins-in-black-coffee/2571#2571"">MT San's comment and related answer</a>.</p>

<p>A second way is to play with the speed of dripping. The idea is to find a speed of water flowing through the coffee ground that gives better results (depending on your goal---here lower acidity). A slower water flow will keep the ground longer, so extract or destruct more compounds---thus a different flavour. In my limited experiments here, faster flow brings more acidity. But I am not confident on the generality of this result.</p>

<p>An alternative, when you are fine with changing beans, is to get a variety or a blend that results in lower acidity. This is not as efficient as a dark roast, but you can get more flavours and variations. Roasting artisans should be able to offer good candidates.</p>

<p>There may be other ways, but I have no other experience.</p>

<h3>Later...</h3>

<p>Thanks to @Chris_in_AK, I have recalled another alternative: Cold-brew. The question refers to ""drip-brew"", so cold-brew is border-line, but it is technically a drip, with cold water, so here it is.</p>

<p>Cold brew allows to extract very different flavour profiles. The slow, soft process takes ages (8 to 12 hours), for often surprising results. And warming up the result leads to yet again different flavours.</p>

<p>In my experience, drinks are less acid with coffee brew. I do not use a wide range of beans, so please keep in mind that this claim may depend on the species. Also, the roast level leads to different results---exactly as a hot-water drip does.</p>

<p>Cold brew emphasizes ""green"" or ""herbal"" notes, though. It is, I believe, worth a try as acidity is different, but it is yet different from ""usual coffee drinks"". Well, production is hard too.</p>

"<p>The other day I was watching an interview with award winning barista and how does he prepare the award winning cup of coffee. </p>

"
"<p>The process of compressing the coffee powder in a portafilter of an espresso machine before pulling the shot is called <strong>tamping</strong>. There is a lot of information available on the web explaining how it is done correctly, such as, e.g., <a href=""http://www.coffeeresearch.org/espresso/tamping.htm"">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Tamping is an important part of making a good espresso shot, so yes, you should press the coffee in the portafilter.</strong></p>

<p>The reason for compressing the coffee powder is to allow the pump to build up the pressure needed for brewing espresso correctly. If you don't tamp it, there is typically not enough resistance and the water rushes through the portafilter too quickly, resulting in underextraction of the coffee powder (and hence, suboptimal taste). Furthermore, a good tamp prevents <strong>channelling</strong>, where the water does not flow well-distributed through the coffee powder.</p>

<p>If the coffee drips too slowly when you tamp, a couple of things can be tried:</p>

<ul>
<li>Tamp with less force. The correct pressure depends on the coffee powder, the diameter of the portafilter, etc. - so 22.5 kgs may simply not be right for your combination of machine and powder.</li>
<li>Grind your coffee less fine - this will lower the resistance.</li>
<li>Change your beans. In my experience, lighter roasts cause more resistance.</li>
</ul>

<p>Options two and three are only listed for the sake of completeness - normally the tamper force is adapted to the other variables, and not the other way around. A good espresso making tutorial should give you a starting point on how to find the correct tamping force and grind coarseness level for your combination of beans and machine. Also, if you own an espresso machine and never heard of tamping, you may want to read one anyway.</p>
"
"<p>Tamping is of course one of the main steps of espresso brewing. Still, 22.5 kgf seems a bit extreme to me. I have used the same Kenwood k.mix machine, a few kgf would do a good espresso according to my experience. (Actually, you can't apply 22.5 kgf with the original plastic tamper, supplied with the machine, even if you want to.)</p>

<p>Furthermore, according to (Illy, 2005), vertical tamping force should be at most 20 kgf.</p>

So, these organizations also have a certification procedure for coffee brewing machines.</p>

<p>From the question, I understand that you want to keep the brewed filtered coffee in the carafe for a while and you are asking for the maximum allowed time for that.</p>

<p>The answer is; the machine will try to keep the coffee intact <strong>as long as it can</strong>; however, at that temperature the water will eventually vaporize and the rest of your coffee will turn into a bitter, dark, burnt coffee.</p>

<p>Simply, your coffee will eventually die as living beings and your high-quality gadget may just slow this, but cannot stop.</p>

<p>Solution: Just taste it. Fresh filtered coffee always tastes better. According to my experience, first half hour is the tasty period.</p>

"<p>The space between them is very hot to be cleaned right after preparing the espresso, actually. It is better to wait for a while and then remove the portafilter to clean if you are not planning to prepare a second one right after. See image below from a manual.</p>

<p>The space in between can be cleaned after given number of use. E.g. after every 50 use.</p>

"<p>As far as the actual coffee end of matters (I have no background in behind-the-scenes business management, etc.), there are a few things to take into consideration:</p>

<ol>
<li>Research your demographic. Younger? They more than like prefer espresso based milk drinks akin to Starbucks, other chain coffee shops. Middle/to older? They probably are a blend of esp.based and brewed coffee with food items. Survey and poll people you know and have connections with if any venture of this sort would be a hit or a miss for a community.</li>
<li>Less is more (usually). Provide fewer option with more willingness to simply make drinks to order. Let the guests know that the menu is only a suggestion and a price guide. Have the standard staples (Espresso, Latte, Cappuccino, Cafe au Lait, Cafe Americano) add in some specialized espresso drinks (Cortado, Affogato, Espresso Macchiato, Latte Macchiato) and a comfortable array of brewed coffees (a dark roasted Mocha/Java blend, a medium roasted house blend, and a few single origin coffees: Kenyan AB, Sumatran Mandehling, Ethiopian Sidamo, Guatamalan Huehuetenango, etc.) prepared a few different ways ('ol reliable auto drip with Zojirushi style urns, pourover, French press, etc.). At the end of the day, just let your customers know that with your knowledge, you can get them what they want if they inform you of a few specific preferences. All the minutiae don't matter once you've overcome that barrier.</li>
<li>Invest. Don't cheap out on grinders or 'spro machines or sourced coffees. Also don't overspend. See how much projected traffic you'd be taking in to see whether a 1, 2, 3, 4 group espresso machine is necessary for 100-200-300 drinks a day. </li>
<li>Talk to experienced folks. Restauranteurs, foodies, snobs, baristas, etc. Do your homework and see what works and what doesn't.</li>
</ol>

<p>All the rest is good business sense and a lot of perseverance. I can't give you advice on these things due to my lack of experience in management, but I would wish you luck.</p>

"<p>If you are simply looking for less acidic beans (rather than changing your brew method), you may check into finding coffee that was dry processed and then dark roasted.  Darker roasts will have less acidity than a lighter roast (a fairly well established truism).  However, processing method is a huge factor in affecting the flavor of coffee.  Wet and pulp methods are aimed at increasing the ""brightness"" and high notes in coffee, which generally means more acidity.  Dry process tends to enhance the body of coffee at the expense of brightness (less acidity).  It is very hard to directly compare flavor profiles from process methods since they tend to be very distinct by region and it's hard to find coffees that are from the same areas, but processed differently.  Dry process will not work well in a wet/humid region; it will actually produce sub standard coffee.  </p>

<p>If you are willing to change your brew method, as suggested elsewhere, cold brew may also be a way to go.</p>

"<p>Well, I barely found any details and facts regarding keeping coffee in thermoses after brewing, and what does ""<em>meeting the requirements of the <a href=""http://kaffe.no/"" rel=""nofollow"">ECBC</a>/<a href=""http://scae.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">SCAE</a>/<a href=""http://scaa.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">SCAA</a></em>"" actually mean.</p>

<p>But while investigating and analyzing data, discovered interesting facts, to my mind, which are against of approach of keeping coffee in thermoses:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Caffeine is getting out</strong> quicker, than I was thinking. A cup of brewed coffee left at room temperature for <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/r7ycf/does_dayold_coffee_lose_its_caffeine_content/"" rel=""nofollow"">24 hours had about 60% of its caffeine remaining</a>. Coffee left at 4 degrees Celsius for 2 weeks had less than 5% of its original caffeine content.</li>
<li>It's <strong>hard to wash</strong> these kind of thermoses from inside, normally you just rinse them intensively. So initial bacteria concentrations are higher than in dish-washed containers and cups. (this topic on <a href=""http://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/1628/how-should-i-clean-a-stainless-coffee-carafe"">cleaning of stainless coffee carafe</a> could be considered)</li>
<li><strong>The coffee which gets into thermos containers isn't that boiling hot</strong> (80°-85° according to specs) <strong>to make the container ""sterile""</strong>. It would likely be safe for many bacteria that found coffee a nice growth medium. As the counter argument, for a sterile container, not related to thermoses storage: <a href=""http://cooking.stackexchange.com/a/66005"">coffee can be stored for and consumed within 8 weeks</a> (the general bacterial count was &lt;1 CFU/mL).</li>
<li>The thermos doesn't have heating source, and <strong>loses it's temperature pretty quick</strong> 1.5-3 hours, is my guess. It reaches ideal temperature (approximately 34-37 degrees) and boosts the processes being perfect medium, which encourages the growth of bacteria/fungi (<em>see #2 and #3 above</em>).</li>
<li>Coffee <a href=""http://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/123/when-does-coffee-go-off"">degradation over time</a> and <strong>the loss of aromatics affects the flavor profile</strong>.</li>

"<p>I have been roasting coffee for years now at home. I definitely can pick out overall coffee differences (body, acidity, astringency, fruited, etc.) but when I read ratings and notes from my provider (Sweet Marias), I see very specific and distinct note descriptions of flavor that I don't necessarily get. Also coffees being 'sweet' is very subjective to me (I like pourover black but espresso sweetened). By themselves, I do not find most coffees particularly sweet in the way of fruit or sugar or caramel (from lightest to darkest roasts).</p>

<p>Is there a way I should be preparing my roasted coffees to notice nuances and pick out sweetness?</p>

"<p>I heard that there are different kinds of coffee beans, which have different specialties like aroma, taste, flavor. But I don't know what causes these differences.</p>

"<p>Almost every coffee shop I go to serves up quite acidic and bright coffees. It seems that this is where modern coffee is and is not necessarily a bizarre phenomenon in itself but in particular the world of espresso it has veered quite far away from the traditional Italian style.</p>

<p>In fact it seems we've veered so far towards acidity and people have actually called the Italian style of espresso as 'over-roasted' which I believe to be untrue. I do enjoy a somewhat more acidic coffee when I am searching for a fruitier cup but I do not understand the current stigma against even the slightest darker roast.</p>

<p>So what caused this tip in the scales that prompted the surge in popularity in brighter and more acidic coffees and seeing even the slightest darker roast as being over-roasted?</p>
"
"<p>For me, there are many factors that all led to my preference to medium-light roasts. Any one of these factors by itself is trivial, but together they form a stronger argument.</p>

<ul>
<li>I wanted to drink coffee black to lessen the empty caloric intake.</li>
<li>I didn't like the existing dark-roasted coffee served black. It was
too bitter.</li>
<li>I think dark-roasts taste great in espresso, but I don't have an
espresso machine.</li>
<li>Lighter roasts offer more complexities that are interesting served
black, but are covered up with milk/sugar. Why preclude those
complexities as a roaster?</li>
<li>Single origin differences can be drastic, and while master blends
might be the best to balance flavors, it's nice as a consumer to
learn the differences myself and make my own blend.</li>
</ul>

<p>So I don't think there's a stigma against it, it's just that's not what people like me are looking for. I hated coffee before I discovered lighter roasts, and I think there are a lot of people like me who have been converted by it.</p>
"
"<p>It's the same answer to the question, Why does hot water clean better?</p>

<p>When water is hot, the molecules spread farther apart and move around faster. This allows the molecules to work its way in to dirty material and loosen it up. It speeds up the process of soluble matter in becoming solubilized.</p>

<p>So does hot water clean better? Well it cleans faster, which to many people is indeed better.</p>

<p>But that doesn't mean cold water can't clean, and in the same way, it doesn't mean cold water can't solubilize the flavors in coffee. But it is slower.</p>

<p>Another part of this is that the flavor of anything is different cold vs hot. Some people prefer hot to cold coffee and so out of convenience just hot brew instead of going through the trouble to brew it cold and then heat it up.</p>

<p>I'd also argue that cold brewing vs hot brewing extract different proportions of acids/tannins/flavors, and that you can brew with varying times/temperatures/pressure to get the proportions you prefer. You may like the proportions that hot brewed coffee gives, but want to drink it cold (such as iced-coffee). Or the reverse, cold-brewed served hot.</p>
"
"<p>I think there are a number of factors influencing the current situation.</p>

<ul>
<li>The rise of micro/small and home roasters.  This allows people access to fresher coffee.  The acidic and bright notes in coffees tend to fade quicker than roast notes.  Meaning these bright notes are more readily available to the consumer.</li>
<li>Changes in coffee processing.  Different process methods favor different flavor profiles.  Dry Process (the oldest) favors less bright and more bodied flavors.  Newer processing methods enhance bright flavor profiles.</li>
<li>The rise and market dominance of large chain roasters.  These companies tend to roast dark because it is easier to hit a consistent flavor profile which lasts longer (important for shipping), but it sacrifices the origin flavors which are varied greatly and available.  They have given dark roasts a more McDonald's character among consumers (consistent, but not high quality). </li>
</ul>

<p>This is not to say that dark roasts are bad.  But they have partially been given a bad rep by large chains who are using them to maximize profit, and not flavor.  Home and microroasters now also have unprecedented access to a HUGE variety of beans that years back would have been out of reach.  This means that companies can cheaply distribute very high quality beans with extraordinary flavor profiles when roasted at a lighter level.  </p>

<p>My primary hope is for this to be as pleasant and pain-free as possible, both for <em>consumers of the coffee</em> (e.g., produces a good cup), and for <em>maintainers of the machine</em> (reasonable to service/maintain).

"<p>Based on my experience, I can say that stirring does not affect the brewing process in a French press a lot. The initial stirring is just for homogenously distributing the grounds in the water.

"<p>I picked up a pack of Kenco Millicano 2 gram sticks to take to college with me because the coffee at the college doesn't taste great and is €1.50 for a tiny cup, so I was wondering in your experience what would be an acceptable volume of water for this mass of coffee?</p>

"<p>Those sound like single-serving packets; <strong>they are probably intended for a single ""cup"" of coffee -- somewhere between 150mL - 250mL</strong> (5 fl. oz. - 8 fl. oz), depending on how strong you prefer your coffee.

<p>I'd suggest starting with 150mL / 5 fl. oz. and try it. Add more water as necessary. Or, in the event that you like it even stronger, use less water next time. For a strength more like mass-market coffee, you might get up to 350mL cup (10 or 12 fl. oz.).</p>

<p>What's the best way to calibrate the grind size? I'm brewing with an Aeropress.</p>
"
"<p>What do you mean by improve? French press is one of the most popular brewing methods in the world, and rightly so: it's dead easy to operate and produces a great cup of coffee. The mechanism is very simple and easy to clean, a good french-press pot will last years if not decades, and if any part of it breaks it's cheap and easy to replace.</p>

<p>What improvements might you make in general? Control over the brew is probably the most important, and with French press is there really anything you could add? The plunger separates the grounds and the coffee very effectively in a good pot, so not much room for innovation there. The other main variables: grind and timing are beyond the scope of the actual pot. In terms of maintenance and ease of use, the pot is optimal already too.</p>

<p>One could argue that the Aeropress <em>is</em> an improved French press, since the brewing method is similar, especially if you use a metal filter. But it's more of a faff to use, doesn't scale so well (you can get 12-cup Cafetières), and tailored much more to the coffee enthusiast than the average person who just wants a cup of what the know and like.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> A cafetière is already optimal for making French press, there's no room for significant innovation, beyond inventing new ways to brew coffee.</p>
"
"<p>Short answer: <strong><em>Slowly. Binary search.</em></strong> But for espresso, Turkish, moka, or AeroPress: I adjust mine to nearly the tightest (smallest) setting possible that still allows me to turn the crank without difficulty.</p>

<p><strong>Method:</strong> This is how I adjust mine.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Approximate the setting by eye.</strong> Looking at the burrs, gauge about how large you'd like your grounds to be. </li>
<li><strong>Mark this setting</strong> (temporarily) with a wax pen or marker.</li>
<li><strong>Grind a bit of coffee</strong> and look at the average grind size; <strong>determine whether you'd like it coarser or finer.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Change the setting</strong> by N (e.g., 4) steps in one direction.</li>
<li><strong>Repeat</strong>. Grind a bit more coffee. If you went in the correct direction (finer or coarser), determine whether you'd like it finer or coarser. (Start over if you went in the wrong direction)</li>
<li>Change the setting by going N ÷ 2 (e.g., 2) steps in that direction.</li>
<li>Repeat the grind and check. Terminate if you're happy, or go one step at a time until you are happy.</li>
<li><strong><em>MARK THIS SETTING</strong> AND HOPE YOU NEVER HAVE TO CHANGE IT</em> ;-)</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>My experience:</strong> I have a similar Hario model (<a href=""http://www.hario.co.uk/coffee/hand-grinder/ceramic-grinder-skerton.html"">this one</a>), which sounds marginally <em>more</em> difficult to adjust than the one you're talking about. I use mine for almost all of my daily coffee grinding. I set it very infrequently: I go through phases between pour-over and moka, and I try not to go through these phases more than once per month to avoid adjusting this thing.</p>

<p>To adjust my model:</p>

<ul>
<li>Remove top nut.</li>
<li>Remove crank handle.</li>
<li>Remove setting bracket.</li>
<li>Twist the toothed, threaded washer/nut about the threaded shaft to move the nut up (counter-clock, coarser grind) or down (clock-wise, finer grind).</li>
<li>Replace bracket, handle, top nut.</li>
</ul>

<p>I mark the ""set-screw"" nut with a marker to remember where I've tried. I try to avoid going more than one revolution either way; on mine, two revolutions goes from moka-fine powder to French-press coarseness.</p>

<p><strong>When you've figured it out...</strong> I have put scratch ""marks"" on the screw for I (moka: fine), II (drip: medium), III (French press: coarse) so that I don't have to guess quite as much. Highly recommend indelible marks on your grinder once you find the setting you like. To change from one setting to the other, adjust to the middle: then go tighter to the ""fine"" setting, and looser to the ""coarse"" setting (otherwise, it can be ambiguous).</p>

<p>Other than changing the settings, I like the thing. There was even a Kickstarter that funded a stabilizing mechanism for the bottom to ensure a more-even grind: it launched as <a href=""http://kuissential.com/product/evengrind-coffee-grinder/"">EvenGrind</a> (I have no affiliation with it).</p>

"<p>A well sourced coffee that has been properly roasted and brewed can be amazingly sweet. It's not the same kind of sweetness of cane sugar, but maybe milk is a better example. Milk is not entirely sweet when cold, but as soon as you heat it to around 130F, it's turns deliciously sweet. 
In any event, you will want a lighter roasted coffee. I think it can be a strange transition for people's pallets, especially for people that have been drinking a darker roasted coffee their whole lives, it becomes hard to identify a light coffee with the ""coffee taste."" A lighter roasted coffee preserves the sugars within the coffee, and brings out the wonderful acids and flavors that come from the fact that coffee is indeed the seed of a fruit. 
I think if I was you, I would purchase some coffee from a specialty coffee roaster (like: verve, ritual, 49 parallel, Intelligencia) and see if one of them really amazes you in any way, and then try and achieve that same roast profile. Other then that, don't always take those taste profiles to heart! They can certainly be different for anyone, and some often pretty silly. </p>

<p>Good luck!</p>

"<p>I've owned a Toddy and Hario Cold immersion brewer, and even tried using a french press. All methods share similar process in common, such as using cold or room temperature water over ground coffee, let it sit there and brew for over 12+ hours. I would imagine using approximately 36g of grounds (double grams used for hot coffee) in the Aeropress and allow it to sit overnight for 12+ hours. It appears would be much easier to clean up than a Toddy or french press since you just plunge out the cake</p>

"<p>The best would be buying a home roaster, but that would be expensive.</p>

<p>corn popper does an amazing job considering how cheap and easy it is.
(hair drying is like corn popper in principle, but will need you to manually make sure the heat is used evenly, corn popper just do it automatically)</p>

<p>Using a pan need some practice but could be lot of fun to try.</p>

<p>So if you have the money and want to invest in it go for home roaster if not popcorn popper would be great.</p>

<p>just remember, you cannot make a good coffee out of bad quality coffee beans while the opposite is true.</p>

"<p>Two more methods: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Oven roasting. A simple sheet pan and and working oven is all you<br>
need.</p></li>
<li><p>Campfire or Open flame roasters.  Basically a metal box with a long handle.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><em>Expanding on hoc_age's response</em> --></p>

<p>I prefer air poppers. They're simple and cheap. I have a modified Air Crazy I've used for 3-4 years and a more recently acquired unmodified Poppery 2.  The Poppery 2 is easier and roasts larger batches but I haven't really dialed in the method as well as the Air Crazy. The Poppery 2 shows great potential and I'd recommend an old one bought on ebay for any beginner. $20 or so and it roasts 2-3 days worth for my 3 person household per batch. </p>

<p>Commercially produced home roasters can run $200-500. You gain automation and maybe consistency for that price though. I've been so happy with the air poppers I've never bought a machine.</p>

<p>---Side note about air roasting (in poppers at least)- it definitely doesn't produce a homogenous roast for me when using blends. I've spent a lot of time watching the beans while roasting and I attribute this to varying size, density and moisture in the varietals used in the mix. Even single source coffees may vary in these characteristics to a lesser degree.</p>

"<p>I think it simply develops with experience.</p>

<p>Bear in mind that typically those cupping notes are often written down as they carry out (hopefully) systematic cupping sessions. I wouldn't expect those distinct note descriptions to match up entirely unless you were going through the same cupping technique. Various brew methods will accentuate (dare I say alter) different qualities of coffee, and I think the coffee cupping method is the most efficient way to present varying coffee's eccentricities. A filtered coffee may ""rob"" you of the body they talk about, and a percolator will rob you of, well, everything (I jest).</p>

<p>Someone who spends a lot of time cupping and then employing different brew methods is best positioned to say how a berry-like coffee might taste like as an espresso vs as a black chemex. BTW, I'm the same with my black pourover coffee vs sweetened espresso, but I must say that I couldn't evaluate nuances even in black pour-over coffee until I started to learn to enjoy it without sugar.</p>

"<p>You should also consider the manufacturer.  We have had excellent support from Capresso.  Our CoffeeTeam GS died after 12 years of daily operation and we purchased an CoffeeTeam Pro from Sur La Table.  The Pro was a disaster, but they stood behind it, and after the second repair we asked if they would trade it out for a GS.  They did, no questions asked. (We had purchased it from an authorized dealer).</p>

"<p>I stumbled across an <a href=""https://www.quora.com/What-are-all-the-different-types-of-coffee-drinks/answer/Peter-Baskerville"" rel=""nofollow"">answer on Quora</a> that describes the many different espresso-based coffee drinks.</p>

<p>In the author's answer, he defines a doppio as:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Double Espresso or twice the amount of coffee and twice the amount of water.  Basically it describes two shots of espresso in one demitasse container.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He then goes on to define a short black:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A pure intense Italian favourite with a biting crème head.  Contains 75ml of pure double shot (2) coffee essence made from 24gm of fresh ground coffee beans.  Traditionally served in glass and is referred to as Espresso by European customers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is there any difference between the two if they're both double shots of espresso served in a glass container?  Or is a short black a technical term referring to a specific ratio of coffee to water?</p>
"
"<p>As far as I know, a short black is a <em>single</em> espresso, as in it's literally just another word for a single espresso. A short black is a single 30ml shot, and a doppio is two, 60ml. Nothing added to either, and the vessel you're serving it in varies by where you are, and doesn't change the name in any case :-)</p>
"
"<p>According to this author's description, short black is defined as two and half times water and three times coffee.</p>

<p>A regular espresso is prepared with 7–9 grams of coffee and 25–30 ml of water.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> <em>In Wikipedia, short black redirects to regular espresso as seen <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/short_black"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>.</em></p>
"
"<p>Look everyone, the amount of coffee needed inside a tea bag in which to make a cup of coffee is very minimal. It will be thin-bodied. Notwithstanding the taste issue is merely the science of how hot the water is and how long the coffee needs to steep. Unlike a French press, the general properties needed for a tea filter bag to SEAL the coffee in requires a heat-sensitive sealant. The sealant used will clog the pores of the filter paper and you will never get enough coffee in the filter to make it taste decent while making it affordable. K Cups were designed to brew like drip coffee and have the cleanliness and convenience to replace the single tea bag coffee. It tastes way better and costs about the same. </p>
"
"<p>As @MT_San noted in his answer:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When coffee is brewed in a french press, the main parameters are (apart from the coffee itself)</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li><p>the temperature of the water</p></li>
  <li><p>the duration of brewing</p></li>
  <li><p>the water quality</p></li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>However, I would argue an important parameter is missing from the above list that directly affects the speed at which the plunger presses down. I'm talking about the <strong>grind size</strong>.</p>

<p>Just as a puck of espresso must be ground and tamped to ensure even extraction, the same applies to the grounds used in the French Press method.</p>

<p>For instance, this <a href=""https://bluebottlecoffee.com/preparation-guides/french-press"" rel=""nofollow"">guide</a> from Blue Bottle recommends 
the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If it’s hard to press, that means your grind is too fine; if the plunger thunks immediately down to the pot’s floor, it means your grind is too coarse. The sweet spot, pressure-wise, is <strong>15-20 pounds</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While the above ""sweet spot"" may be subjective (i.e., author's bias, type of beans used, grind level, equipment/Brand, etc.), you can use the above as a benchmark to ensure your grounds are not <em>too</em> fine or <em>too</em> coarse. If one or the other, you're liable to over-extract or under-extract when brewing your coffee, impairing the quality of the beans to truly shine.</p>

"<p>Since @MTSan already gave an excellent answer, I thought I would throw a twist into the discussion.</p>

<p>While you asked whether or not the shape of the drinking vessel would impact the coffee's flavor, this leaves out an important aspect of the cup you're drinking from: <strong>it's color</strong>!</p>

<p>While there are a few different sources out there, here's <a href=""http://flavourjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/2044-7248-3-10"" rel=""nofollow"">one research paper</a> on the subject I found.</p>

<p>In it, the authors note that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Both experiments demonstrate that the colour of the mug affects people’s ratings of a hot beverage...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>...it is possible that colour contrast between the mug and the coffee may have affected the perceived intensity/sweetness of the coffee.""</p>

<p>While all such research should be taken with a <em>statistically significant</em> grain of salt, it's still food for thought.</p>

"<p>As has been mentioned, the species of coffee makes a difference. There are something like a hundred different species, with Robusta and Arabica being the most common commercially grown by far.  Liberica is another species that is grown in small quantities and has a very distinctive taste.</p>

<p>Within a single species such as Arabica, there can be a huge number of varietals. Some are naturally occuring (such as Bourbon and Typica). Maragogype (""elephant bean"") is also a naturally occuring mutation from Brazil. Others have been bred by research institutes. For example SL-28 and SL-34 are common Kenyan varietals. </p>

<p>Another famous varietal is the ""Gesha"" (sometimes romantically but incorrectly called ""Geisha""). This came to light when an estate in Pananma ""La Esmarelda"" noted something interesting when they were cupping their coffee. By separating their harvest, they finally identified a small section which was contributing to the overall cup. This coffee went on to dominate the Cup of Excellence competition and set a world record price at the time. It's since been planted on other farms which brings up the next point.....</p>

<p>As has been mentioned, things like altitude, soil and micro-climate affect the taste. So the Gesha (or any other) varietal from one farm won't taste exactly the same as Gesha from another farm. </p>

<p>The way of preparing the green beans - washed, dry-processed, or a number of other methods, all have their effect on the final flavour. So even the identical cultivar harvested from the same farm but prepared differently will produce different flavours. (The difference between dry and wet-processed is very signficant.) The actual care taken during preparation is also hugely important - I suspect that if one is starting out with a decent high grown bean, this is what really separates speciality coffee from the mass produced stuff. It takes a lot more care to prep the coffee carefully.</p>

<p>And I haven't even mentioned roasting and brewing....</p>

<p>I think this is what makes coffee so interesting - there <em>is</em> so much variety to try and enjoy.</p>

"<p>What equipment is pretty typical for a coffee stand at a farmer's market?  I would like to server pretty standard drinks including drips, pour overs, lattes, espressos, etc.  What are suggested menu items to have to really establish a clientele, but to also not go overboard on expenses, and what equipment is generally needed to open a stand?</p>
"
"<p>There are several factors that affect differences between coffee beans.  I'll list them in order of occurrence since the influence factors of each are greatly debated.</p>

<ul>
<li>Genetics: There are several species and varietals out there.  These vary from major differences between species (arabica, robusta, liberica) to more subtle differences between varietals.  </li>
<li>Growing Conditions:  Plants with the same genetics, but grown in vastly different climates will have differences in flavor.  Humidity, rainfall, elevation and temperature all have their say with a set of plants.  Coffee is ultimately an agricultural product and will vary accordingly.</li>
<li>Processing:  There are a variety of processing methods.  Dry Process, Pulp Natural and Wet Processing will all produce different flavor results with the same beans.  Different methods are more accessible or more/less useful varying by region.</li>
<li>Roast Method:  Flavor profiles may also vary by roast method.  Air roasting and contact roasting may highlight different notes in coffee.</li>
<li>Roast Level:  The level to which beans are roasted (along with how that level is reached) is the last factor to affect the bean.  </li>
</ul>

<p>Arguments could also be made for storage, but I would generally dismiss it as storage has optimums that are meant to keep flavor, but can't really enhance it in any way.</p>

"<p>I've noticed that there's a distinct lack of Q&amp;A's on green coffee processing methods. As this is one of the earliest steps on the journey from seed to cup, I was curious:</p>

<p>In other words: Why does Farmer A prefer to use the dry process method while Farmer B favors the wet process?</p>

<li>Wet Process</li>
<li>Semi-Dry Process/Pulped Natural</li>

"
"<p>Off the top of my head (by no means exhaustive):</p>

<h3>A two-group double boiler espresso machine</h3>

<p>You want two groups in case something goes wrong with one of them, you're not out of business. You also want to be able to use the steam wands while extracting, so the need for each group to have a double boiler is pretty big.</p>

<p>Instead of one machine that costs a ton, you can get two machines (each with one group and a double boiler) that cost anywhere from $1000 to $3500 instead. Try not to go with home appliances - even though I have nothing but great things to say about Breville, they <em>aren't</em> designed for that kind of continuous duty cycle.</p>

<p>Redundancy is not all that's important, you need to be able to make more than one drink at a time :)</p>

<h3>At least two burr grinders with dose control</h3>

<p>Dose control gives you consistency. And you need to be able to grind as many beans as you plan to offer without cleaning grinders each time. These can get insanely expensive as you get into features like auto tamping - the biggest thing to look for is accurate dose control.</p>

<p>I recommend a model that fires once you stick a portafilter under it, with a button to extract into a pitcher. They <em>sometimes</em> come with a small stand to tamp, if not, grab some of them (if not auto-tamping).</p>

<h3>Refrigeration</h3>

<p>I don't recommend using a cooler with ice for dairy - it's going to start off as too cold and work its way up to being too warm. A small dorm-size fridge would be better, and cheap enough that you can have a backup you can run home to get if you need it. Get a good fridge thermometer to figure out the ideal setting for the fridge (usually a dial between 0 and 9), mark it with a sharpie once you get around 35 degrees Fahrenheit (don't buy one that won't go below 40 degrees). Remember that fridges have cold spots, so measure at the bottom as well as near the coils (where the ice lives). </p>

<p>You also need refrigeration for you, too. Nothing says gross like sweat falling into coffee! An evaporative air cooler, or at least some fans really help. </p>

<h3>Misc Equipment</h3>

<p>Your pour-over setup, some presses, tables, rubber mats, pitchers, various kinds of spoons, condiment / syrup dispensers, napkins, etc. Don't forget cups, sleeves, alternative sweeteners (be nice, buy honey from a vendor there, helps business). Also, don't forget corrugated trays (recycled) for large orders.</p>

<p>You can also never have enough cotton bar mop rags. Don't forget a camping stove or induction cooker, and if you use an induction cooker, make sure everything you need to put on it will work.</p>

<p>If you're going to be blending stuff, get a <em>good</em> blender that can eat through ice easily. Another thing that's nice to have two of in case one breaks. </p>

<p><strong><em>Don't forget, you need to be able to wash your hands.</em></strong> Sanitizer is good, but having a basin and bucket is also helpful.</p>

<p>And, don't forget whack-buckets, trash cans, etc. </p>

<h3>Ticket Handling System</h3>

<p>This is really important. Imagine you have 20 people lined up and 10 orders going. Make sure you know what people ordered, what needs to go out next, and that the tickets are clear. Soy instead of whole milk? Make sure the person making the drink knows that, and that it goes to the right person. </p>

<p>POS (point of sale) systems are increasingly cheap and really help with this. But old fashioned pen and paper tickets work well too, if you have a system in place. This is a really bad way a great setup can fail if you don't get it right.</p>

<h3>Water</h3>

<p>You're going to need some big plastic bladders full of clean filtered water. You'll also need to make sure it's possible to get that water into the coffee machines easily :) Transporting that much water can be a challenge because it can get so heavy that applying the breaks in a normal vehicle takes on a whole new dynamic. Got a place that delivers it?</p>

<h3>Testing</h3>

<p>Make sure you do a dry run, that's the only way you'll be sure you have everything you need. </p>

<p>Everything else is pretty unique to what you want to offer, but if you keep it simple it's not <em>too</em> bad. If you're going to offer cakes and snacks, have a way to keep them fresh. </p>

<h3>Menu Items</h3>

<p>Keep it simple and keep it confined to what <em>you</em> can make consistently well. Tell people they're welcome to ask, but avoid anything super complicated from becoming a permanent fixture on the menu. </p>

<h3>Cost your drinks</h3>

<p>You should charge 3x your cost to be safe, 2 - 2.5x if you want or need to be <em>really</em> competitive. 3x is pretty certain to cover your costs, overhead, and profit. You need to know how much it costs you to make every single thing, how much it costs to just open and tear down, and everything else. Another great reason for keeping a simple (10 things is good) menu. </p>
"
"<p>I think, one should know the diversity of these three techniques to distinguish the differences.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Wet process</strong> can be said the industry standard. The fruit is <em>totally peeled off to the bean</em>, then the beans are dried.</p></li>
<li><p>In <strong>dry process</strong>, the fruits are left intact to dry themselves first. Then, peeled of, washed and dried for the second round.</p></li>
<li><p>In <strong>semi-dry process/pulped-natural/honey</strong>, <em>just the skin of the fruit</em> is peeled of, but the meaty part is left on the bean. Then, the fruit is dried, peeled of to the bean, washed and dried for the second round.</p></li>
</ol>

<hr>

<p>It is clear that <strong>pulp-natural</strong> or <strong>dry</strong> processing are costlier than <strong>wet</strong> processing -whatever the metric is; monetary, labor or time.</p>

<p>Another factor is flavor. <strong>Dry</strong> or <strong>pulp-natural</strong> processed beans include more fruity notes as the fruit fermented together with the bean during the first drying phase.</p>

<p><em>(It is said that pulp-natural beans are less acidic than dry beans, but I have not experience that myself.)</em></p>

<p>Note that, dry or pulp-natural processing is not available everywhere. E.g. if you see a bag of Guatemala dry processed beans*, just run away. As Guatemalan weather is so humid, you can hardly dry process the fruit without mold.</p>

<p>(*) Probably, it doesn't even exist.</p>
"
"<ul>
<li>Dry Process | This is the oldest method of modern processing.  It requires very little equipment.  It is basically a manual process of letting the coffee cherries raisin up, then peeling them.  It is a labor intensive process.  Dry processing tends to produce body heavy, smooth coffees with complex notes.  Dry processing is used extensively in Brazil and accounts for the distinct different flavor profiles from other South American coffees.  Dry processing is not practical in humid, wet, or temperate areas, as dry heat is necessary to dry the fruit in a short enough amount of time and to assure that mold or fungus does not set in.</li>
<li>Wet Process | This method start with running the cherries through machinery to remove the skin and outer layers of the fruit.  The beans with remaining inner layers of fruit are soaked in water and allowed to ferment.  Additional processing is done  to remove the final inner layers surrounding the bean.  The result is left to dry (usually with additional machine assistance).  Wet processing requires a comparatively large investment in equipment, access to enough water for the process and creates waste water that must also be dealt with.  The process does allow for multiple areas to sort beans (floating during fermentation, in channel after fruit strip, etc) that potentially allow for a more uniform product.  Wet processed coffees tend to be missing the overt fruit notes of a dry process, but this is debatable and can vary based on fermentation methods (additional additives are sometimes used in the fermenting process).  </li>
<li>Semi-Dry / Pulped Natural / Wet Hulled / Semi-Washed | This process is similar to the wet process except the fermentation step is skipped and specialized machines are used to strip the final layers from around the bean.  This method can produce beans with the best of both processing methods, but the machines used to strip the inner layers away are also prone to damaging beans.  This is a faster method of processing but again requires machine investment and resource use.  </li>
</ul>

<p>There are many other factors influencing coffee processing that should be kept in mind.  Individual farmers may not have a choice of processing method.  In many places the processing centers for coffee are quite separate from farms and only one processing center may be available.  Local conditions will also largely dictate what methods are appropriate or available.  There are also a myriad of variations on these methods that may produce different results and weather can play a factor as well (think about an area hit by a monsoon while large batches are trying to dry).  At some level, all farmers are trying to get paid for what they produce.  That being the case, most will prefer some combination of whatever local processing method is available and/or cheapest and produces the highest pricing for their product.  </p>
"
"<p>I guess the answer is it all depends on your taste.</p>

<p>The espresso purest would tell you that there are coffee oils that are left on all surfaces of the brew path after the water flows through the grounds and these oils quickly become rancid.  I'm not really sure how much oil is left on the portafilter after a shot is prepared, but needless to say, this oil will be present, and in order for it to not affect the flavor of any subsequent shots, needs to be cleaned.</p>

<p>If you cannot detect a flavor difference in the second shot and like the way it tastes, don't worry about it and enjoy your doppio.  Otherwise do some experimenting to really see if cleaning it gives you a better result that you desire.</p>
"
"<p>My rule of thumb is to tamp after inserting the basket into the portafilter for one main reason; after the tamp, I want the coffee puck to remain as undisturbed as possible before pulling the shot.  If you have already inserted the basket in the portafilter then dose and tamp, the only required action after tamping is inserting it into the machine's group head.  If on the other hand, you dose and tamp into the basket first, then you have to next insert the basket into the portafilter which has the chance to deform the puck (you do have to exert a bit of pressure to insert the basket into the portafilter!).  This just becomes yet another variable you must control for to gain repeat-ability in your preparation process, and great espresso is all about process.</p>
"
"<p>This is a pretty interesting question which I wanted to ask myself. From what I could gather, there are two points here, one theoretical and one empiric.</p>

<p>As far as I know, caffeine is one of the fastest-extracting compounds in coffee, such that it is extracted almost immediately, so, logically, the amount of caffeine in a brew would only be determined by the amount of beans that go into it and not the brewing method. Which means that whatever comes out of the AeroPress could not possibly have that much more caffeine than other methods. Particularly, not significantly more than an espresso shot, since the amounts of coffee used are about the same.</p>

<p>My own experience, however, suggests otherwise.
When I first got my AeroPress, I (naturally) brewed some coffee with it. Upon drinking just half of the brew, I got a kick stronger than after anything I'd ever consumed before. Several days later I hosted a party where I served AeroPress coffee, and about two thirds of the guests separately noted that the coffee was unusually strong. </p>

<p>Solving this contradiction seems pretty hard. Right now I see several (not entirely exclusive) possibilities:</p>

<ul>
<li>first, that AeroPress brew really does have a significantly higher caffeine content. 
<em>Pretty unlikely, but the possibility is nonzero.</em></li>
<li><p>second, that AeroPress brew contains high concentrations of some non-caffeine compounds, which:</p>

<ul>
<li>are produced  in significantly lower quantities with other brewing methods, and </li>
<li>strongly contribute to the typical effects of consuming lots of coffee.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>I don't know how likely this is, since I'm not aware of whether caffeine is the only major contributor to the effects of coffee.</em></p></li>
<li><p>finally, that it is mainly a placebo-like psychological effect.
<em>Also unlikely, since the guests at the party probably did not have any prior preconceptions about AeroPress coffee.</em></p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Bottom line: coffee from the AeroPress does tend to be perceived as stronger than average by a variety of people (including stronger after-coffee effects), but caffeine might not be the reason.</strong></p>
"
"<p>I'm practicing Aeropress but don't have a thermometer to control water temperature. The one I can put in the kettle with a boiled water. Hence Its quite hard to control the process and progress toward the flavor and taste I want to get. </p>

<p>Since I'll be visiting Hong Kong next week and ""everything is cheap in Hong Kong"" as they say, it seems to be a perfect match. </p>

<p>Can somebody please suggest a place where I can look for a good thermometer? I think I need something like this: <a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/Ystxm.jpg"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/Ystxm.jpg"" alt=""this""></a></p>

<p>This is coffee; if you are experienced, you can brew magic out of one dollar cezve or a two dollar moka. If you use low quality beans you may spoil ten grand espresso machines.</p>

<p>First, believe in your technique and invest in your experience, then invest in the gadgets.</p>

<p>Regarding the actual amount you have mentioned in your question, my humble advice is, one grand is quite a lot of money for a home style espresso machine. There are lots of choices that can produce acceptable quality espresso for even a few hundred dollars. I am sure you can find a very suitable semi-automatic desktop espresso machine for one grand. Even if you cannot, there are many other alternatives you can brew tasteful coffee such as aeropress, V60, French press, etc. those are way cheaper than one thousand dollars. There are always alternative ways to explore a new cup of coffee. After all these years, I am still exploring.</p>

"<p>There are ""basket-shaped"" filters, which I think is what you're looking for. In my area, they're just as common as ""Melitta-style"" cone-shaped filters; you should be able to find them at most markets / grocery-stores. They come in various sizes; you're probably looking for one of the smaller (""junior size"") variety. </p>

<p>From <a href=""http://coffee.stackexchange.com/a/1840"">this previous answer</a>, here's a picture of what you're looking for, I think: a basket-style filter:</p>

<p><a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/YIiwu.jpg""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/YIiwu.jpg"" alt=""basket filter""></a></p>

<p>You can also find them online -- <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B00KOCTPDC"">one example of the ""junior size"" basket filter</a>, which is what I think you want based on what you said about the size of the machine/filters. There are 3 main sizes (and probably more): ""junior size"" (for ~2-6 cup machines -- as linked above), the most common normal/medium size (for 8-12 cup machines), and the large/extra-large size (for large/commercial 20+ cup machines).</p>

<p>They tend to be inexpensive and come in large packs... I hope you drink a lot of coffee ;-)</p>

<p>On the other hand, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2EonB3ZipSs"" rel=""nofollow"">La Marzocco's Reverse Osmosis System</a> provides proper water for their espresso machines, another reason that makes clear that water is really a thing on coffee.</p>

"<p>I would like to ask people's advice on books or nice pieces of articles <em>(of quality comparable to a book)</em> to read.</p>

<p>I am aware that the literature is so wide and it may be classified into coffee cultivation, history, brewing, etc. I don't search for a comprehensive list of all books.</p>

<p>I would like people to pinpoint joyful books on coffee.

"<p>Well, for me: I'd say aeropress has more caffeine in it only if you're using filter-roast beans which I think is what you should be using, and most importantly it depends on the amount of coffee you are putting (coffee to water [91°C] ratio as well as time [a minute  or two, max]). In that case, you'll get more kick of caffeine, cleaner finish,  yet not stronger than the regular brewed or drip coffee in regards to how long you steep it unless you consider the kick of an overly extracted coffee strong.</p>

"<p>I'm looking to upscale our production of cold brew to batches with a 1000L yield, using a ratio of 1:12.5 to make a ready-to-drink coffee for bottling. Currently we run batches of ~40L through a large stainless 40-micron mesh conical filter with good results, however this won't scale so easily as the mesh is really expensive. I'm thinking that making large batches by steeping coffee in big mesh tea bags will be the easiest upgrade. I'm also assuming that a secondary filtration will be necessary, but that's a separate question.</p>

<p>What sort of mesh sizes and materials are best for balancing yield with how fine the filtration is? 
Thanks! </p>

"<p>I'll start by saying I'm pretty much a newbie to making coffee, and in the French press brewing which is why I joined this forum to learn. After reading a number of posts/info and watching videos on Youtube, 
I've tried a few techniques but I still think I haven't quite grasped it.
My main issue is once I have let my French press settle for 4 mins, the ground coffee on the bottom looks exactly the same as when I first put it in about 2 heaped tablespoons. I know it isn't instant coffee but I also read in a post at limiting the amount left at the bottom. This is where I'm getting confused. How much ground coffee should be left after letting it sit?
My french press is a Bodum 12 oz.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance.</p>
"
"<p>Is it possible that you read a few posts on the Internet the wrong way?</p>

<ul>
<li>The grounds will not disappear, if anything they will appear ""more"", volume-wise because they swell in the hot water.</li>
<li>There are two points about ""grounds on the bottom"":

<ul>
<li>In the bottom of your <em>cup</em>, indicating a too fine grind of the beans or a hole in the filter mesh. Some very fine ""dust"" is ok, though. This is french press, not filtered coffee.</li>
<li>Coffee sitting on the grounds after pushing the plunger for too long can negatively influence the taste of the last cup, making it excessively bitter, for example. So drink / pour the coffee shortly after you finished brewing. The time threshold depends on your beans and personal taste.</li>

"<p>I tried drinking Bulletproof Coffee with grass-fed butter and Brain Octane Oil, but I really didn't like the buttery, creamy taste.</p>

<p><strong>Does anyone have any suggestions for a replacement for the grass-fed butter?</strong></p>

<p>I've seen a few people like to use vanilla bean powder, but I don't know if that has the same effect as grass-fed butter or if it's purely for taste.</p>
"
"<p>I have seen folks use coconut oil as a substitute for grass fed butter (or organic butter, or Irish butter or many other variations I have heard).  Almost all of the substitutes I have heard are fat sources designed to get fat based calories into the coffee.  The vanilla bean powder you have heard about adds almost no calories, but will certainly add flavor.  It accomplishes a very different goal than what the Bulletproof folks are espousing.</p>

<p>Keep in mind there are any number of things you can add to coffee to make the caffeine more palatable.  There is an entire industry surrounding this.  What you really need to ask is what you are trying to accomplish by adding something and find the best ingredient for your needs.  Low or no calories flavoring agents maybe suited if you are just not into the taste of coffee.  If you are looking for a fat calorie source, experimenting with different oils until you find one that fits your needs and has a flavor you can deal with may be the way to go.  </p>

<p>Personally I look for more protein and not as much fat in my diet.  I like the taste of coffee.  A plain cup of cone coffee and a serving of organic Greek yogurt accomplishes what I am trying to do just fine and doesn't require breaking out or cleaning a blender.  </p>

"<p>I'm not yet ready to ""invest"" in an espresso machine with in built steam wand and am looking for a gateway to convince me it is worthwhile. </p>

<p>Are there <em>safe</em>, dedicated, decent stove top milk frothers capable of generating microfoam?  I'm currently reasonably happy with what I can get out of my Aeropress but want to ""do milk right"".</p>

<p>So far I have seen the ""Bellman"" on line, but it looks pretty awkward to use and I am not convinced this exactly brimming with safety features. </p>
"
"<p>It's important to note that you should be thinking of your entire espresso budget (i.e. Machine, Grinder, and Accessories) when trying to find the ""right"" price. If you were to buy a $1000 machine, you'd want to spend minimally $300 on an espresso grinder. If you're looking at spending a $1000 total and go with something that requires a little more technique, maybe the popular Rancilio Silvia / Rocky combination is right for you. Also, some say that the grinder is actually the most important component to consider when trying to make amazing coffee on a budget. It might be worth shorting yourself a bit on the machine to afford yourself a better grinder in the long run. I'd recommend the Baratza Vario as a starting point. It's pricier, but it does a fantastic job for both drip and espresso. Also, Baratza has amazing support/service and a history of quality. That can be worth quite a bit in the long run.</p>

"<p>There are several courses available for aspiring baristas to take.  I am interested in opening a farmer's market coffee stand, I have zero Barista experience, however some of these courses are very pricey but are backed by organizations such as the Specialty Coffee Association of America.  I have come across other options at local community colleges under the Barista I and II guise.  At the surface, these two classes do not look that much different, is there anything specifically that I should look for when enrolling in a course like this</p>

<p>From SCAA, Barista I</p>

<p><code>Learn the basics of espresso preparation, milk, and drink building in the Level 1 Barista Pathway. With access to the best tools, coffees, and industry leaders, Level 1 Barista students receive expertly lead training and a comprehensive introduction to the espresso craft.</code>  </p>

<p>From a local community college, extension program</p>

<p><code>Learn about coffee, how to prepare and serve espresso and espresso based drinks. Program will show how to use espresso/cappuccino machine at a commercial level, and will make you confident around coffee and equipment. Completion of Barista program will include a Basic Barista Certification, which can be used for employment referral.
Class will be instructed by a Specialty Coffee Consultant, who has more than 15 years of experience in Italian espresso, espresso equipment (at an engineering level)and barista training in over 80 restaurants and coffee shops.</code></p>
"
"<p>As far as I know, SCAA/SCAE and similar bodies offer <em>somehow worldwide</em> recognized certificates. Local courses may not have such reputation. To learn the basics for yourself, they may both work for you.</p>
"
"<p>The SCAA-certified classes will be of more benefit to you if you're looking for employment at a coffee shop as a barista, roaster, etc.</p>

<p>Given that you're interested in learning the fundamentals of coffee in order to open a farmers market coffee stand, I would say go with the cheaper option. Both will teach you what it is you seek, but only one will set you back thousands of dollars gaining certifications.</p>

<p><em>Note:</em> The SCAA has strict guidelines that some coffee shops simply cannot meet for reasons of cost or another. From the <a href=""http://scaaeducation.org"" rel=""nofollow"">SCAA's education website</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>All Campus locations have successfully completed the <strong>SCAA Certified Teaching Laboratory program</strong>, demonstrating a calibrated teaching environment to teach within <strong>SCAA standards and protocols</strong>.</p>
  
  <p>Campuses also are <strong>required to employ only SCAA Certified Specialized Instructors</strong> for class offerings, ensuring the highest quality of instruction regardless of which Campus a student attends.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Basically, an excellent instructor with all the best equipment who can't afford to take the SCAA classes or meet the space requirements for a teaching space can't teach said classes.</p>

"<p>This is coming a bit late but I hope it helps others. First off, I've tasted coffees made with both Lavazza Quality Oro and BonCafe beans. Both are rubbish. Honestly. Try some freshly roasted coffee and you'll know the difference. Having said that, let's move on.</p>

<p>What you've described in the question is talking mainly about extraction.
Coffee gets extracted as below.</p>

<p>Sour > Flavour > Bitter</p>

<p>If it's sour, it's underextracted. If it's bitter, it's over extracted. Now this does not mean there will not be any sour or bitter notes in the coffee. There will be but it needs to be balanced.
The roasting of the coffee plays an important role too. Some coffees are roasted for far too long and they come out tasting bitter. This is usually the case when the roaster is either inexperienced or is trying to cover up poor quality beans.</p>

<p>To adjust extraction, you can adjust temperature, grind size and brewing method. Some like drip causes the water to flow over the the grounds at rate that's proportional to the flow of water into the drip brewer (like Hario V60) and the size of grinds. Some others, like Aeropress, lets the grinds steep in the water with a little bit of agitation. You need to pick one method that you're comfortable with, then adjust the parameters for that brew method.</p>

<p>You can try increasing and reducing water temperature too.
So how will you know you got a good cup? Taste it. When you start to taste flavours that you've never encountered with that coffee before, you know you're heading in the right direction.</p>

<p>Hope this helps. Enjoy brewing and enjoy sipping the cuppa.</p>

"<p>I have seen many people playing with their Arduino's for robot control, industrial control and even for architectural projects. It seems easy to play with Raspberry Pi and Arduino for such projects.</p>

"<p>I would like to excuse and interrupt this thread kindly as an experienced native drinker.</p>

<p>The supplied link in @William Moore's answer requires sugar. The continuous misunderstanding about sugar usage with Turkish brewing in North America is so surprising to me. In Turkey, regular Turkish coffee drinkers hardly –if not never‒ drink their coffee with sugar. However, sugar is optional in recipes.</p>

<p>In @William Moore's own recipe, in 2nd article, pre-heating does not add any visible advantage, only shortens the time to brew. This is actually what is needed to keep the foam intact and prevent the vaporization of the lipids in Turkish brewing. However, you can provide it by using stronger fire easily in contrast to William Moore's 4th article. It is better to use the time span as the size of your cezve may change, you may brew just for yourself or for five people.</p>

<p>The recipes mentioned here has flaws in my opinion and I don't think you can brew delicious Turkish coffee based on these.</p>

<p>Please check <a href=""http://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/2384/triple-heating-of-the-turkish-coffee"">this answer</a>. I have explained my own style of brewing Turkish coffee with photos.

"<p>Hello this is a serious question, and I dont know if I am really in the right part of stack exchange:</p>

<p>A friend of mine was trying to make a coffee in her lab, she used the microwave to heat the water (I hope you enthusiast do not crucify us for this bewildering savagery). She set the timer to 2.5 min, but then had to run some work. After returning the water had already cooled beyond usability, thus she restarted the heating process for approx. 30s. Before reheating she realized that there was a lot of steam in the microwave cavity. 
After the reheating she takes out the cup, and after having taken it out, the water in the cup <strong>explodes</strong> in her face. </p>

<p>Some word on the used hardware:</p>

<p>The microwave is an old model from Carrefour home
The cup is an ordinary ceramic cup with shape of a truncated cone. </p>

<p>This is not a joke, she did really burn herself and was lucky that she chose her glasses instead of her contacts. However more interesting is, how this explosion came about. There must have been some pressure build up inside the cup but how would such an inhomogeneity in such a small volume be explainable?</p>
"
"<p>I think this discussion should start with the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maillard_reaction"" rel=""nofollow"">Maillard reaction</a>; known as caramelization.</p>

<p>When the beans are roasted, a chemical reaction activated by heat reduce sugars (more correctly, hydrocarbons) within the beans with the proteins (more correctly, amino acids). During this time, some carbon dioxide is emitted as a result of this process and jailed within the cell structure. During this reaction, many organic molecules within the bean are pyrolysed (chemically separated by fire). Probably at that phase, many aromatic lipids emerge that we are actually tasting and trying to extract during brewing. Note that, more fruity aromas were already in the bean before pyrolysis (or caramelization, Maillard reaction, roasting... You may use interchangeably).</p>

<p>Now, let's reason about under- and over- roasted beans:</p>

<p>If you have <strong>under-roasted beans</strong>, you have less carbon dioxide. So you have less foam. You have less aromatic lipids, so you have less aroma. But the overall aroma is more fruity.</p>

<p>If you have <strong>over-roasted beans</strong>, you have so much carbon dioxide. So the cup will sure have a foam. You have aromatic lipids, but probably you have burnt some of the fragile organic molecules on the road. Thus you have a lot of aroma, but the overall aroma will be a bit burnt and bitter.</p>

<p><em><strong>Edit:</strong> I realized that @Geo already explained the Maillard reaction very neatly in a previous answer <a href=""http://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/2172/quantifying-flavor-differences-between-varieties/2550#2550"">here</a>.</em></p>
"
"<p>As far as I see, some explanation is already in the comments.</p>

<p><em>A short explanation may be helpful for the community, so I decided to take a note here.</em></p>

<p>The reason behind that is the super-heated water. In theory, it is possible to super-heat any liquid with polar molecules.</p>

<p>Temperature of an object is defined by the total kinetic energy of its molecules. The kinetic energy has two sources, the linear velocity of molecules, and spin of molecules.</p>

<p>Microwave ovens heat up objects by adding <em>spin</em> to the molecules of an object. Roughly speaking, molecules stay where they are, but spin around very rapidly under microwave to heat up. <em>During this phase, they cannot find a way to vaporize (linear velocity).</em></p>

<p><strong>When your friend take the cup out of the oven, the molecules are not under the effect of microwave (so they don't spin) anymore, so they find their way out to vaporize, and choose to vaporize (linear velocity) very quickly. That occurs as an explosion.</strong></p>

"<p>I am looking at the following coffee grinders: Macap MXK conical burr grinder, Mazzer Robur conical burr grinder, and Mazzer Super Jolly flat burr grinder that supposively produce a low particle size of the ground coffee.

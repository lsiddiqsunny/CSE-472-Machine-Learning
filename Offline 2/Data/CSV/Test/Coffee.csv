22,2,,2015-01-27T21:12:35.147,7,,"<p><strong>In general consistency is more important than a specific setting.</strong></p>

<p>The key is that you can actually control both the size of the grind and actually achieve a homogenous grind allowing you to increase the consistency in the coffee when you brew it as you can assertively control the service area being exposed during the brewing process. Since you stated that you have a burr grinder you are off to a great start. There is no defined, agreed upon coarseness of grind for pour over coffee, but I would definitely say that you would want a courser grind than you would for espresso. Experiment to find the sweet spot by making sure you use exactly the same water, coffee bean roast, and number of beans (and thus volume) between different grind settings to find what meets your flavor best. </p>

<p>If you are particularly worried about ""getting it right"" or do not want to do a ton of experimentation an easy and quick way to jump to a grid would simply to go to a coffee shop, buy a bag of whole beans, ask them to grind it and query them for how coarse of a grind is. </p>

23,2,,2015-01-27T21:13:24.420,13,,"<p><strong>Short reason:</strong> Tradition conflicting with modern brewing practices.</p>

<p><strong>Long reason:</strong> This is more a result of an industry-wide legacy when purchasing equipment, where coffee shop owners will pick up mechanically dosed grinders instead of doserless, or electrically metered models because ""that's how it's been done,"" or because the technology simply wasn't  affordable until simple microcontrollers became cheap. </p>

<p><em>Traditionally,</em> you would grind enough coffee to fill the doser, dispensing grounds for brewing as needed and refilling the doser when the level dropped too low.  Dosers exist to allow for predictably size quantities of grounds to be dispensed into the portafilter, and that's basically it.  </p>

<p>This, however, conflicts with the ""Third Wave"" coffee culture, where flavor and texture are paramount.  In this new culture, coffee beans are ground for immediate use, rather than drawing from a bin.  The moment beans are ground, the gasses contained within (gasses that are the reason Crema exist) are allowed every opportunity to escape.  The longer they sit, the less gasses will be left behind by the time they're used to brew.  </p>

<p>So when a Third Wave coffee shop grinds using a doser, the Barista rapid-fires the dosing lever, essentially moving the coffee straight into the portafilter.</p>

<p>A better plan is just to use a direct-dosing grinder where the grounds are metered by time or weight straight into the filter.  Advances in the packaging options for load cell sensors and simple controllers have made this somewhat common in both consumer and commercial equipment.</p>

<p>The oils in roasted coffee degrade as they are exposed to air (oxidization) as well as heat. As with just about any foodstuff moisture accelerates the spoiling process as well. You should store your coffee in completely sealed, insulated, opaque containers. If you have the ability, vacuum pump the air out of the container for ultimate shelf-stability. Even without vacuum storage you can preserve beans for a long time by placing them inside a ziplock bag or coffee bag with a 1-way air seal and pushing as much air out as possible and then following the above method of airtight, dark and cool storage. Following these guidelines should help to ensure the freshness and flavor of the beans for as long as possible. </p>

33,2,,2015-01-27T21:35:46.843,7,,"<p><strong>Temperature affects extraction rate, but also varies between compounds in the coffee beans.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Coffee grounds contain a hodgepodge of volatile and non-volatile components, such as various oils, acids, and other aromatic molecules [2]. Collectively, these compounds that are found in coffee grounds are referred to as “coffee solubles” and significantly contribute to coffee flavor [2]. Brewing is the process of extracting these components from the grounds, so coffee beverages are technically a solution of coffee solubles and water. Given that coffee grounds are used in both of our brewing methods, the principle variables are temperature and time.</p>
  
  <p>Temperature affects the solubility and volatility of the coffee solubles. Relative to brewing, solubility describes the ability of the solubles to dissolve out of the grounds and into the water; volatility refers to their ability to evaporate into the air. Coffee solubles dissolve best at an optimal temperature of 195-205°F [3]. With more coffee solubles extracted, hot brew coffees are described as more full-bodied and flavorful when compared to cold brew. Moreover, due to increased volatility with higher temperatures, the aromatics are more readily released from coffee, giving rise to that beloved scent of freshly-brewed coffee.</p>
  
  <p>On the downside, oxidation and degradation also occur more rapidly at higher temperatures. The oils in coffee solubles can oxidize more quickly at elevated temperatures, causing coffee to taste sour. Acids also degrade, the most notable of which is chlorogenic acid into quinic and caffeic acid, causing coffee to taste bitter [2].</p>
  
  <p>Where cold brew lacks in temperature, it makes up for in time. Coffee solubles have markedly decreased solubility in room temperature water. Increasing the brew time from a few minutes to many hours aims to maximize extraction of the solubles from the grounds. Even over twenty-four hours, not all the coffee solubles will have dissolved; this is why the amount of coffee grounds is doubled, in an effort to make up for the lower extraction rate. In comparison with hot brew, cold brew is sometimes described as tasting “dead” or “flat” due to the lower yield of coffee solubles [3]. Further, decreased volatility prevents aromatics from escaping from coffee as easily, so cold brew is much less perfumed than its hot brew counterpart.</p>
  
  <p>Oxidation and degradation will still occur in cold brew methods, but this happens much more slowly; bitterness and acidity are just about absent in cold brew coffee, especially if it is kept cold. Though, cold brew doesn’t merely taste like hot brew without the bitterness. Fans of the cold brew method have emphasized that cold brews contain a completely different flavor profile that can’t be found with hot brews. Going back to the idea of solubility, not all flavor compounds of coffee solubles are equally soluble. A good majority of the coffee solubles are still able to leach out of the grounds, even in colder water. The compounds that don’t dissolve are the ones often attributed to unfavorable flavors [4]: these stay in the grounds that are subsequently tossed away. Consequently, cold brews take on a much sweeter, floral profile.</p>
  
  <p>To note, brew time does not determine caffeine content, nor does bitterness indicate coffee strength. Caffeine is extracted early in the brewing process, so extending brew time, by either method, would only result in over-extracted coffee [1]. Coffee “strength” is defined as the amount of dissolved coffee solubles per unit of coffee volume [1]. On that train of thought, cold brew certainly produces stronger coffee, given that the brewing process purposely concentrates the coffee solubles. Though, keep in mind that rarely anyone drinks cold brew coffee straight up; many enjoy this smooth drink diluted with milk or water. - <a href=""https://scienceandfooducla.wordpress.com/2014/08/19/coffee-brewing-chemistry-hot-brew-and-cold-brew/"">https://scienceandfooducla.wordpress.com/2014/08/19/coffee-brewing-chemistry-hot-brew-and-cold-brew/</a></p>

</blockquote>

<p>Chris in AK has a great explanation in the comments as to why darker roasts are <em>perceived</em> to have less caffeine</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is a common misconception that darker roasts have less caffeine.  Caffeine's melting point is 455F which is well above what most beans reach during the roasting process.  Essentially, caffeine content changes because the mass/density of the beans change (they lose water and undergo changes in the roasting process).   If you measure your coffee by volume, dense greener beans will have more caffeine.  If you measure by weight, darker roasted beans will have more caffeine.</p>

35,2,,2015-01-27T21:50:40.847,9,,"<p>Bitterness comes from over-extracting coffee. Over-extraction is mainly caused by:</p>

<p>1) brewing for too long: In the beginning of the brewing stage acidic flavors are first extracted, followed by sweetness.  And towards the end of the brew, only bitter flavors are extracted.  The trick is to stop the brewing just after all the sweetness is extracted.</p>

<p>From Wikipedia: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_extraction#Extraction_yield"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_extraction#Extraction_yield</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Yields of under 18% are ""under-extracted"", specifically
  ""under-developed"" – desirable components have not been sufficiently
  extracted – and ""unbalanced"", specifically sour, because acids are
  extracted early, while balancing sugars (sweetness) and bitter
  components are extracted later. </p>
  
  <p>Yields of over 22% are ""over-extracted"", specifically bitter, as
  bitter components continue to be extracted after acids and sugars have
  largely completed extraction.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>2) Grind size being to small: small grind size means larger total surface area of the particles.  Therefore, flavors get extracted more quickly and can lead to over-extraction. </p>

<p>The optimal brew time and grind size vary depending on the method (french press, manual pour, espresso etc..), and you'll need to experiment to get it just right.  The type of coffee bean also matters, but probably to a lesser degree than the above two factors.</p>

46,2,,2015-01-27T22:18:54.370,15,,"<p>There are a lot of factors that contribute to the bitterness of coffee. Some of these have to do with the concentration of various compounds in the coffee and the roasting process, but the way you brew the coffee can make a big difference as well.</p>

<p>Assuming that you are not going to be harvesting and roasting your own coffee, we can focus on the brewing process.</p>

<p><strong>Buying Beans:</strong> Robusta vs Arabica</p>

<p>To decrease perceived bitterness in coffee, the best choice is Arabica. Arabica beans are often sweeter with notes of sugars and fruits and a somewhat wine-like acidity. Robusta on the other hand tends to be harsher with more bitterness. This difference in quality is reflected in cost however, as Arabica tends to be more expensive than Robusta.</p>

<p>In terms of roast level, medium roasts generally contain fewer soluble solids, more acidity and a stronger aroma than dark roasts. All of these should contribute to making medium roasts on average less bitter than dark roasts.</p>

<p><strong>Water</strong>: Temperature and Chemistry</p>

<p>You have to find the sweet spot when it comes to temperature, a little trial and error can be used here depending on the blend and brewing method. For example, the people at AeroPress recommend a much lower temperature to reduce bitterness that what you would use in a french press.</p>

<p>In general research has shown that coffee brewed in hot water is perceived to be less bitter than when cold water is used. Additionally, bitterness is reduced when hard or soft water is used when compared to distilled water.</p>

<p><strong>Brewing [Extraction]</strong></p>

<p>Bitterness is strongly correlated with the amount of dissolved solids in the brewed coffee. To ensure that the amount of dissolved solids and the overall extraction is correct (and minimally bitter), make sure to use the correct grind coarseness, water temperature, and brew time for your chosen method. Over extraction can be a major cause of bitterness.</p>

<p>Drip and pour-over brewing methods tend to have less bitterness than a french press or other immersion methods. This can be attributed to less dissolved solids in the coffee. </p>

<p><strong>SCIENCE</strong></p>

<p>Much of this section will be outside the control of most, but it is interesting nonetheless. </p>

<p>Research has found that the introduction of polyphenols reduces the bitterness of coffee. The metallic bitterness found in some coffee has been attributed to  dicaffeoylquinic acids. Trigonelline is perceived as bitter at concentrations of 0.25% and its degredation is proportional to roast level. Roasting Trigonelline produces a byproduct called pyridines and helps create the roasty aroma found in some coffee.</p>

<p>Chlorogenic acid is also found in coffee, higher concentrations in Robusta than Arabica, and that contributes to the bitterness as well. Additionally, Quinic acid is a product formed from the degradation of Chlorogenic acid and is present in coffee at twenty times its taste threshold, contributing to the bitterness.</p>

<p>Furfuryl alcohol is also known to increase the bitterness of coffee.</p>

My point was, indoor coffee plants aren't that effective. Outdoors, a good plant will produce around 2-3 lbs. of grean beans per year.

<p>Body:</p>

72,2,,2015-01-27T23:26:47.247,15,,"<p>The flavor and aroma of the beans continue to develop for the first few days after roasting as the beans release gas (this is the reason some retail coffee bags have valves to let the gases out). The process is <a href=""http://www.thefreshloaf.com/node/11119/cooling-bread-how-long-wait"">similar for bread</a>, with some bakers preferring to let some types of bread rest longer than others.</p>

<p>Right now I am actually drinking a cup of coffee made from beans I roasted this morning, because of poor planning. There's nothing wrong with it but I think it will be better in a couple of days. I find the aromatic qualities peak about 24-48 hours after roasting, but that may be because the off-gassing process is literally emitting the most fumes.</p>

<h2>How the flavor changes</h2>

<p>Subjectively, I'd say the smell and taste change like this:</p>

<p>During <strong>early roasting</strong>, there are wood and vegetable smells, like when you put green wood on a fire and it puts out a lot of moisture-filled steam and begins to smoke.</p>

<p>Toward the <strong>end of the roast</strong>, the smell is more from the browning/caramelization/Maillard reaction and smells kind of like burnt toast. Not really much like coffee.</p>

<p>If you grind and drink it <strong>immediately after roasting</strong>, it tastes like generic coffee,  with those toasty flavors foreground. Very simple and straightforward without a lot of nuance.</p>

<p><strong>After 24 hours</strong> the toasted character has diminished and the nuances have developed a lot more. You can really notice the difference between bean origins. There is much more powerful rich ""amazing coffee"" aroma. I find the sheer quantity of aroma very appealing at 24-48 hours.</p>

<p>Some beans continue to change for <strong>several days after roasting</strong>. Recently I had a batch of Indonesian beans that were still developing and becoming more characteristically Indonesian after a week. I liked them more, but someone else might have liked them less.  </p>

<p>And that, when it comes down to it, is what matters. Some people find some varieties more interesting, more palatable or less harsh as they age. But <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_gustibus_non_est_disputandum""><em>de gustibus non est disputandum</em></a>.</p>

<p>It's amazing the human nose and tongue can sense these differences.</p>

<p>That's really the heart of it. If the grind is too coarse for your brewing method, your coffee will end up under-extracted, weak, and acidic.

<p>Longer roasting removes some of the caffeine from the bean, so a lighter roast would be preferred. Additionally you should chose Robusta beans, since their inherent caffeine content is higher than that of arabica beans.</p>

<p>The next step is the grinding. The smaller you grind, the easier it is to extract ""material"" from the ground. This is due to the additional surface area you expose.</p>

<p>Then the last step is the extraction. The longer you expose the ground to water, the more substances you absorb. The extraction roughly has three steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>Extraction of Acidity</li>
<li>Extraction of Sweetness</li>
<li>Extraction of Bitterness</li>

<p>Usually you try to stop extraction after the second step, to have the coffee taste nicely. By that point in time most of the caffeine is already extracted.</p>

<p>If you'd want to get <strong>all</strong> the caffeine out of a ground, you'd have to go through with extracting the bitterness, too. But for general purpose drinkable coffee it's definitely preferrable to stop after extracting the sweetness</p>

138,2,,2015-01-28T13:34:08.870,12,,"<h2>Basics</h2>

<p><strong>Decaffeination</strong> (<em>decaf</em>) is the removal of <strong>caffeine</strong> from coffee beans, cocoa,  and other caffeine-containing materials. While soft drinks which do not use caffeine as an ingredient are sometimes described as ""decaffeinated"", they are better termed ""uncaffeinated"" because decaffeinated implies that there was caffeine present at one point in time. Decaffeinated drinks contain typically 1–2% of the original caffeine content or sometimes as much as 20%.</p>

<p>In the case of coffee, various methods can be used. The process is usually performed on unroasted (green) beans, and starts with steaming of the beans. They are then rinsed with a solvent that extracts the caffeine while leaving other constituents largely unaffected. The process is repeated from 8 to 12 times until the caffeine content meets the required standard (97% of caffeine removed according to the international standard, or 99.9% caffeine-free by mass as per the EU standard). Coffee contains over 400 components important to the taste and aroma of the drink, so it is difficult to remove the caffeine without affecting other components.</p>

<p>Want to know even more?</p>

<h2>Advanced</h2>

<p>Well, then, let's talk about the two most common types of decaffeination:</p>

<h3>Swiss Water process</h3>

<p>The use of water as the solvent to decaffeinate coffee was originally pioneered in Switzerland in 1933 and developed as a commercially viable method of decaffeination by Coffex S.A. in 1980. </p>

<p>This method is different in that it does not directly or indirectly add chemicals to extract the caffeine. Rather, it relies entirely on two concepts - solubility and osmosis - to decaffeinate coffee beans. The process begins by immersing a batch of green coffee beans in very hot water in order to dissolve and extract the caffeine. The water is then drawn off and passed through an activated charcoal filter. The porosity of this filter is sized to only capture larger caffeine molecules, while allowing smaller oil and flavor molecules to pass through it. However, this extraction process will also extract desirable oils and other solids from the beans, resulting in beans with no caffeine and no flavor in one tank, and caffeine-free but with flavor water in another tank. The Swiss Water process method attempts to overcome this difficulty by first discarding the flavorless caffeine-free beans, and then reusing the flavor rich water to remove the caffeine from a fresh batch of coffee beans. Water saturated in this way is referred to as green coffee extract or GCE. It is created using a separate batch of green coffee beans, which are immersed in water and then discarded. In a pre-loading tank water, cane sugar and formic acid are mixed and heated and used to preload carbon filter columns. The GCE is then filtered over the columns to extract caffeine from it. A fresh batch of green coffee beans is then immersed in the GCE to remove caffeine but retain other components. The other components can be retained because the water is already saturated with flavor ingredients, therefore, the flavors in this fresh bath cannot dissolve - only caffeine moves from the coffee beans to the water. This results in decaffeination without a massive loss of flavor. The process of filtering the GCE to remove caffeine and immersing the beans is repeated until the beans are 99.9% caffeine free by mass, meeting the required standard. This process takes 8 to 10 hours.</p>

<h3>CO<sub>2</sub> process</h3>

<p>it is technically known as supercritical fluid extraction. This method is the most recent method developed by Kurt Zosel, a scientist of the Max Plank Institute, and uses liquid CO2 in place of chemical solvents.</p>

<p>The supercritical CO<sub>2</sub> acts selectively on the caffeine, releasing the alkaloid and nothing else. Water soaked coffee beans are placed in an extraction vessel. The extractor is then sealed and liquid CO<sub>2</sub> is forced into the coffee at pressures of 1,000 pounds per square inch to extract the caffeine. The CO<sub>2</sub> acts as the solvent to dissolve and draw the caffeine from the coffee beans, leaving the larger-molecule flavor components behind. The caffeine laden CO2 is then transferred to another container called the absorption chamber where the pressure is released and the CO<sub>2</sub> returns to its gaseous state and evaporates, leaving the caffeine behind. The caffeine is removed from the CO<sub>2</sub> using charcoal filters and the caffeine free CO<sub>2</sub> is pumped back into a pressurized container for reuse on another batch of beans. This process has the advantage that it avoids the use of potentially harmful substances. Because of its cost, this process is primarily used to decaffeinate large quantities of commercial-grade, less-exotic coffee found in grocery stores.</p>

<p>There are like 3 more common processes but I believe 2 is enough, even for coffee enthusiasts like us.</p>

<ul>
<li>One reason that the taste isn't as good for Robusta is that it has more caffeine compared to Arabica. Which may sound like a positive thing but caffeine carries a bitter taste which makes it an unpleasant drink. In fact the Robusta bean has 2.7% caffeine content, almost double the 1.5% of Arabica.</li>
<li>Arabica contains almost 60% more lipids and almost twice the concentration of sugar than Robusta. This factor also probably has a big impact on why we prefer the taste of Arabica.</li>
<li>From a price perspective, green beans of Robusta is about half the price of Arabica green beans on the commodity market.</li>
<li>Robusta is easier to tend to on the farm, has a higher yield and is less sensitive to insects - the extra caffeine is a chemical defense for the coffee seed as the quantity in the Robusta is toxic to bugs.</li>
</ul>

<p>All of these factors help bring up the supply and lower the input costs for farmers to produce. With this more attractive price point, a lot of roasters back in the day would add Robusta to their blend in an attempt to reduce their costs and increase their profits. When coffee was initially sold in the 1900s the quality of coffee slowly and slowly deteriorated in an effort for companies to squeeze the most profit.  </p>

<p>Where you’ll find it: Nowadays, it’s not often you’ll find Robusta in a coffee blends or in coffee shop. If you’re drinking instant coffee? Well, that’s probably all Robusta… but you probably don’t care very much about taste. In your espresso blend? That’s a mixed bag. Literally. Oddly enough, Robusta is still widely used as part of espresso blends – specifically Italian style blends. <em>It is said to help improve</em> the <strong>crema</strong>. 
One thing to note is despite the association with Arabica of being higher quality, and Robusta as being lower quality, it’s not always the case. Top notch specialty Robusta coffee will usually taste as good as or better than low end Arabica. However, high end Robusta isn’t widely used or available. Rather, Robusta is usually used as a filler or cost reducer. </p>

<ul>
<li>Robusta beans are much more circular, whereas Arabica are more oval.</li>
<li>Chlorogenic acid is a significant antioxidant and an insect deterrent. Robusta is 7-10% CGA and Arabica has 5.5-8% CGA.</li>

141,2,,2015-01-28T13:58:33.807,34,,"<p>Yes, it's perfectly safe to drink and <em>extremely delicious</em>. In The Philippines, we often call this 'Kopi <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_palm_civet"">Alamid</a>', and it truly is one of the rarest coffees on the planet. At around $20 per 75 grams (local price), it's also one of the world's most expensive coffees. </p>

<p>The palm civet is a nocturnal cat (well, more like a ferret, but technically a cat) that eats the berries (beans) and is <em>extremely</em> picky in its diet. For the civet to choose a bean, it has to be <em>just right</em> when it comes to the aroma, and given the sensitivity of this creature's nose, said aroma means the bean is perfect. Some say the digestive process itself lends to better flavor, it can be a matter of heated debate depending on where you ask ;)</p>

<p>The thing is, the cat doesn't digest the whole bean, just the outer pulp. Farmers follow them around and wait for nature to take its course, then the beans are processed in a very safe manner. Farmers typically get just a kilo or so a day, it's quite an intensive process.</p>

<p>I drink it as often as I can afford to do so, and I have never gotten sick. It's a partly fruity, partly nutty and just an all over <em>cozy</em> and relaxing taste that I highly recommend if you're able to get the coffee. Just be prepared to pay quite a bit, and ready to consume it quickly after getting it home (it does not keep as well as others, probably due to local transportation issues prolonging the time it takes from roasting to actually get to market).</p>

<p>If you have a hand-powered burr grinder, I recommend using it and grinding pretty gingerly, even the heat of most ceramic grinders is enough to lose a little bit of the fruity taste you'd otherwise get. Really, treat these beans like royalty, they're that good.</p>

<p>If you buy some, try to avoid buying from farms with captive civets - the growing popularity of this coffee has led to a cottage trapping industry, which is (unfortunately) likely to seriously endanger them soon.</p>

<p>A crude diagram:</p>

<pre><code>    ||||||     &lt; Tamper

| .......... | &lt; Tamped coffee
| .......... |

</code></pre>

<p>But how much coffee that is, and just how much over 15kg you need to apply in order to tamp that much coffee to get the right pressure to pull a great shot is a matter of science that you'll need to do. You might want a finer grind instead of more pressure, you have to experiment.</p>

<p>Start with your usual espresso grind setting, a dose appropriate for the size of the filter you're using and then work from there.</p>

<p>You can get grinders that auto tamp for you based on your settings, so when you hit that 'eureka!' moment, you can reproduce it somewhat reliably <em>using the same equipment</em>. For home use? Just be ready to experiment with the first few filters full when you get beans you haven't tried before.</p>

<p>There's no real 'rule' here, other than you want as much coffee as you can get in the filter with the tamper sinking flush given about 15kg-ish of pressure. It varies wildly from there.</p>

<li><p>Coffee enthusiasts &amp; aficionados identify acidity as the dry, bright &amp; sparkling sensation that sets a high-quality, high-grown coffee apart from a mundane, lower-grown coffee. Admittedly, this is the rather snooty way of looking at the issue, though it is true that many highly-prized coffees are grown at high elevation &amp; are characterized by their bright, nuanced qualities.</p></li>
<li><p>On the scientific side, acidity is something to be measured on the pH scale, which uses 7.0 as an indicator of neutrality, numbers under 7 as more acidic &amp; numbers above 7 as lower-acid (or basic). Lemon juice registers at about 2.0; milk at 6.5. A typical higher-acid breakfast blend coffee might land somewhere around 4.7. (Note that ""black coffee"" is marked on the scale below as a 5; this is an average &amp; certainly not universal.)    </p></li>
<li><p>The amount of chlorogenic acid (CGA) is a natural chemical compound which is the ester of caffeic acid and (-)-quinic acid can also determine acidity.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The first one is definitely opinion based, the second one differs from blend to blend, from area to area. Because the acidity of the bean is directly proportional to the pH of the soil where the blend is grown. 
The third one divides your choice into two categories, <em>Robusta</em> and <em>Arabica</em>, with Arabica having a lower CGA.
My choice for a optimal coffee would be the <em>Arabica</em> variety somewhere from south-west South America, Middle East, eastern Europe or west Asia.</p>

146,2,,2015-01-28T14:38:57.277,19,,"<p>The flavor constituents of roasted coffee are the result of high roasting temperatures. After roasting, they continue to be affected by environmental factors, their own natural instability, and interaction with other compounds. The most important of these processes are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Dissipation into other media. Aromatics evaporate from the surface of the coffee into the atmosphere or are dissolved into solvents, where they often interact with other chemicals.</li>
<li>Non-enzymatic browning reactions. These involve carbohydrates, usually sugars, in carmelization and Maillard reactions. Carmelization occurs when a sugar gives up water and carbon dioxide, changing the structure of the sugar and its taste. The Maillard reaction is the result of an interaction between amino acids and carbohydrates in which an aromatically perceived substance is formed. When the Maillard reaction takes place at a high temperature (as in coffee roasting), the result is usually desirable roasted flavors and aromas, but when it takes place at a lower temperature, the result is flat, gluey, and cardboard-like flavors.</li>
<li>Oxidation. Oxidation is any reaction in which one or more electrons are moved from one chemical to another, producing two different compounds. In coffee, the most common process is that an oxygen molecule donates two electrons to a compound, forming a new (differently perceived) compound and bonding with hydrogen to form water.</li>
</ul>

<p>The engine that drives all of these processes forward is thermal energy (heat). This energy can be in the immediate environment, a result of other chemical reactions, or already present in the product.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Unlike all of the other posters in this thread, I have done this experiment. A cup of brewed coffee left at room temperature for 24 hours had about 60% of its caffeine remaining. There's been lots of talk of caffeine's chemical stability, but it's a carbon and nitrogen source for bacteria.

</blockquote>

<p>First, is your idea of going bad that it has a funny taste and is not as fresh as it once was, or is it that it actually tastes as though it is spoiled? Yes, coffee can go stale when it comes to taste, but it won’t actually be spoiled or dangerous to drink.</p>

<p>Once your coffee is opened and introduced to oxygen, the shelf life timer begins to tick. Storing coffee in hot, humid, or sunlight areas will only make matters worse. The best way to keep your coffee fresh is to store it in a container that is air tight and will remain cool – but not in the refrigerator.</p>

<p>Do you typically buy your coffee ground for you? With a far greater surface area of coffee coming in contact with the oxygen, those grounds are going to stale much quicker than whole beans will. I highly recommend investing in a hand or electric grinder to experience the fresh taste and aroma of beans you’ve ground yourself.</p>

<p>When coffee goes bad, it can become bitter and even rancid. Every bean will react differently to oxidation. If you start to notice your expertly roasted beans losing quality and general yumminess, it may be time to buy some fresh beans. Don’t know how to find amazing, fresh coffee? I wrote a guide on that.</p>

<p>No matter what you do, you will not be able to get that fresh flavor back once it has left the bean. The most important thing to do is keep it locked up tight. However, if you are a true coffee lover, it may not sit around long enough to even think about going bad. Just remember this rule of thumb: about two weeks after roast the coffee will start decaying.</p>

<p>This is completely unscientific and I can't identify which steps here are the relevant ones for the good results, but maybe if you experiment with some of these adjustments you can identify what works and what doesn't. </p>

<h2>The Equipment</h2>

<ul>
<li>Aeropress</li>
<li>Scoop that came with the Aeropress</li>
<li><a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B00A1GVVMY"" rel=""nofollow"">Ultra fine mesh filter</a></li>

<h2>The Coffee</h2>

<p>I store the ground coffee in its can in the fridge for up to a week or a week and a half, depending on how long it takes me to drink it all. Today I'm using Trader Joe's <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B00GK5R8IG"" rel=""nofollow"">Jamaica Blue Mountain Coffee</a>, a delightful medium roast. (I just now learned that Serious Eats says <a href=""http://drinks.seriouseats.com/2014/01/worst-and-best-coffee-at-trader-joes-which-coffee-to-buy-tj.html"" rel=""nofollow"">it's the best bet</a> for Trader Joe's coffee.)</p>

<h2>The Water</h2>

<p>Melted snow from the Wasatch Mountains, filtered through whatever the county of Salt Lake does before it gets to my kitchen tap, and heated on the stove until just before the boil. There are tiny bubbles forming on the bottom of the kettle, but few of them are rising to the surface of the water.</p>

<h2>The Method</h2>

<p>I'm pretty loosey-goosey about my brewing method, but the results are very consistent. This leads me to believe it's the equipment and the beans that are generating the great results, not anything I'm doing right.</p>

<ol>
<li>Set up the Aeropress for <a href=""http://ineedcoffee.com/upside-aeropress-coffee-brewing-tutorial/"" rel=""nofollow"">inverted brewing</a>.</li>
<li>For one shot, use a generous scoop of ground coffee. Tap the assembly on the counter so the mound of coffee flattens out.</li>
<li>Slowly add your just-off-the-boil water. (I use a <a href=""http://districtbean.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Hario-Buono-Kettle.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">gooseneck kettle</a> for easy, controlled pouring.) Rotate the Aeropress as you pour and do so until you can no longer see any dry grounds. (The chamber should be about 2/3 full when this is complete.)</li>
<li>Stir slowly until you get that lovely uniform light brown color on the top of the mixture. I use the handle of the scoop for stirring.</li>
<li>Place the cap and filter on top of the assembly and wait 15-60 seconds. (My own brewing time varies wildly, depending on what distracts me during that time.)</li>
<li>Press. With this fine grind and filter, you'll have to press a little harder than with the coarser grind. As you press you'll see foamy buildup gather on top of the grounds. You'll have to press extra hard at the end to squeeze all of that through, but it will drip down onto your shot at the end and form that delightful crema.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Edit:</h3>

<p>As I pay more attention each morning, I've noticed a couple more things:</p>

<ul>
<li>My results vary significantly. I <em>think</em> the contributing factors are the grind and how hard I press at the end.</li>
<li>I never use soap on my Aeropress equipment. I rinse it with tap water after each use, but never run it through the dishwasher. There may be buildup of coffee oils on the surfaces that helps (or hinders??) the foam making process.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Edit Redux:</h3>

<p>For the past few weeks I've been casually experimenting with my morning coffee and coming up with very inconclusive results. (As I <a href=""http://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/58/whats-the-most-effective-way-of-generating-crema-from-an-aeropress/165#comment772_165"">mentioned below</a>, all I've come up with are a bunch of totally surefire ways to absolutely demolish the crema, and no methods of preserving it.)</p>

<p>This half-butted casual science ends now! I just bought a hand grinder and <a href=""http://aeropresstimer.com"" rel=""nofollow"">an app full of AeroPress recipes</a>; thusly armed, I'm going to experiment more formally. Well, a little more formally. I'll track the results <a href=""https://docs.google.com/a/stackoverflow.com/spreadsheets/d/1tKJx-io7Zk71vrcn0SBcCHRxw2ui5UGpmDaPtViXXec/edit#gid=0"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a> and update this answer when and if I come up with a reliable way to generate and preserve the foam on my AeroPress shots.</p>

<h3>Edit The Third:</h3>

<p><a href=""https://docs.google.com/a/stackoverflow.com/spreadsheets/d/1tKJx-io7Zk71vrcn0SBcCHRxw2ui5UGpmDaPtViXXec/edit#gid=0"" rel=""nofollow"">The results are in</a>: I've figured out how to stop killing my crema. It turns out that the combination of <strong>freshly ground beans</strong> and <strong>the mesh metal filter</strong> is somehow stopping the crema from getting through to the cup. Eight attempts with hand-ground beans failed miserably, and my first attempt after reverting to store-ground beans (with the 'somewhat loosey-goosey' method above) generated a nice layer of foam in the cup.</p>

<p>However, the plot thickens. My <a href=""http://coffee.stackexchange.com/users/137/robert-cartaino"">colleague Robert</a> asserts:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Never had a problem getting crema with aeropress. Lots of fresh coffee ground to a powder, very little very hot water. Makes my ubercoffee syrup shots I talked about a year or more ago... with plenty o crema. Dilute to taste (which I never did &lt; jitter >).</p>
  
  <p>...and I'm not entirely sure, but if memory serves, switching to the fine metal mesh filter meant bye-bye to crema. It's been a bit too long to remember for certain. I just reused the same paper filter over and over for months (actually, I used two to keep them from blowing out).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So it would seem that:</p>

<ul>
<li>Freshly, very finely ground coffee + paper filter + not much water = crema city</li>
<li>Coffee ground fine in the store + metal filter + water = crema town</li>
</ul>

<p>I'd be interested to see others' results from experiments like these.</p>

<p>This graph was created using data from <a href=""https://gastrograph.com/"">Analytical Flavor Systems</a> where we build quality control and flavor profiling tools for craft beverage producers. <em>Perceived Quality</em> is a non-hedonic assessment of a product's quality.

<p>Likewise, if you are pulling different espressos (for example, a standard blend and a single origin), you should thoroughly clean the portafilter between pulls. </p>

  <p>When water reaches a boiling point, it doesn't necessarily turn to steam. It needs some kind of physical spot—a ""nucleation site""—to form a bubble. This can be an imperfection or crevice in the surface of the container. <strong>That’s why a clean, scratch-free jug of water heated in the microwave can seem to be below boiling point, but explode as soon as you move it.</strong></p>
  
  <p>The water in there is super-heated beyond 212 degrees, but hasn’t found any nucleation sites to let it turn into steam. <strong>When you disturb it, swirls in the water can be enough to release all that pent-up energy into steam.</strong> Another example is throwing salt into boiling pasta water. It suddenly roils because you just tossed a handful of nucleation sites in there.</p>

2820,2,,2016-05-14T20:05:29.820,1,,"<p>How's the mastering coming?</p>

<p>Thought I would weigh in to provide a little extra help. I'm a barista and head of customer education at Handground. We are working on a French Press brew guide right now but since it's not done, I'll share a quick tutorial.</p>

<p>The goal with brewing coffee on any device is to maximize the extraction of good-tasting flavors and minimize the bitter ones. I suggest starting with the following recipe and then adjusting it to find the right balance of flavor.</p>

<ol>
<li>Heat water to 205F</li>
</ol>

<p>Depending on your kettle, this might mean taking your water off the heat for about one minute after boil. Use a thermometer if possible!</p>

<ol start=""2"">
<li>Weigh out coffee to 57g</li>
</ol>

<p>There's an easy ratio to follow when deciding how much coffee to use. It's called the water-to-coffee ratio, and it will help you methodically experiment with different brew recipes. To find the water-to-coffee ratio, take the total mL of water (around 800-850mL for a normal-sized French Press) and then divide by the number of grams of coffee (mL and grams are conveniently equal in weight). In this case, 800/57 is about 14. That means our ratio is 14:1. From now on you can use the inverse of this ratio to adjust your recipe. For example, if you want to try a 15:1 ratio (a weaker coffee), take 800ml and divide by 15 to find the amount of coffee to use. </p>

<p>If you don't have a scale, 57g is roughly a half cup of coffee, but remember that lighter roasts are more dense than dark roasts, so it will require less volume of coffee to reach your desired weight. </p>

<ol start=""3"">
<li>Grind your coffee course</li>
</ol>

<p>Here's an example of what your grind should look like: 
<a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/jXWlB.jpg"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/jXWlB.jpg"" alt=""Handground french press grind""></a></p>

<p>It's really important to have a consistent grind. If you don't the different-sized grounds will extract at different rates, meaning some of them will turn bitter and others will stay weak. This is a bad mix of flavors. For the most consistent grind, use a burr <a href=""http://handground.com/handground"" rel=""nofollow"">coffee grinder</a></p>

<ol start=""4"">
<li>Pour water over coffee and let bloom</li>
</ol>

<p>Dump the grounds into the French Press and then pour just enough water over the grounds so they are all saturated. If you have a scale, shoot for about as much water as you have grounds, so 57mL. The coffee will begin to bubble up and ""bloom"" if it is fresh. Let this happen for about 30 seconds</p>

<ol start=""5"">
<li>Pour 800mL water total, set for 4 minutes</li>
</ol>

<p>Pour 800mL of hot water into the French Press to achieve our desired water-to-coffee ratio. For most a normal 32-ounce French Press, this is about an 1 1/2 inches from the top. Start timer for 4 minutes and let the coffee steep. Place the lid on top of the grounds to capture the heat but DO NOT PLUNGE YET!</p>

<ol start=""6"">
<li>Plunge after 4 minutes</li>
</ol>

<p>Press the plunger down through the coffee. This action will tell you something important about your coffee. If pressing the plunger is really difficult, the grind might have been too fine. There should be slight resistance but nothing that makes you struggle. This is one indication that you might need to adjust the grind, but tasting the coffee will be the ultimate test.</p>

<ol start=""7"">
<li>Remove all coffee from French Press</li>
</ol>

<p>Leaving the coffee (the drink, not the grounds) in the French Press will allow for the coffee to continue extracting, turning it bitter. If you don't drink it all at once, remove it and place in a thermos or carafe. </p>

<p><strong>Adjusting your brew recipe</strong></p>

<p>This recipe is just a starting point. Now you should adjust your recipe to improve the coffee. The best cups of coffee have extracted all the sweet, desirable flavors from the cup and none of the bitter, negative flavors. Naturally then, the best cup of coffee sits right at the tipping point of sweet and bitter. </p>

<p>You should adjust your recipe by changing just one thing at a time. Here's a simple formula to follow:</p>

<ol>
<li>Assess your latest cup of coffee</li>
</ol>

<p>Was your coffee strong and sweet? Weak and bitter? Somewhere in the middle? Understanding this will be the starting point for adjusting your recipe.</p>

<ol start=""2"">
<li>Adjust for coffee strength</li>
</ol>

<p>You adjust the strength of your coffee by changing the amount of coffee you use. We can use the water-to-coffee ratio that we talked about to do this. If your coffee is weak, or watery and tea-like, use a lower water-to-coffee ratio like 13:1 or 12:1. If your coffee is overwhelmingly strong, raise the ratio to 15:1 or 16:1. Divide the amount of water used (800ml) by desired ratio number (14, 15, 16, etc.) to find the number of grams of coffee to use. </p>

<p>Brew another batch of coffee with the adjusted water-to-coffee ratio and repeat until you're happy with the strength.</p>

<ol start=""3"">
<li>Adjust for sweetness/extraction</li>
</ol>

<p>Strength and extraction are not the same thing. Strength is the amount of coffee dissolved in the coffee solution while extraction is the percentage of ground coffee that was dissolved. Extraction controls how sweet or bitter a coffee is, but not its strength.</p>

<p>If you notice your coffee is bitter, you should reduce the extraction rate. You can do this in two ways: Make the grind more course or shorten the brew time. Both will allow for less extraction, meaning less negative flavors.</p>

<p>If your coffee is sweet, I suggest finding its peak sweetness before being satisfied. Increase the extraction rate by using a finer grind or extending the brew time. Do this until you brew a batch of coffee that comes out bitter, and then dial your extraction rate back to the last degree where it was sweet. This is as delicious as you will be able to brew your coffee. </p>

<p><strong>Recap</strong></p>

<p>To summarize what I just wrote, here are a few key things to remember about brewing with the French Press and dialing in the optimal recipe:</p>

<ol>
<li>Consistent grind is key</li>
<li>If your coffee is weak, increase the strength by adding more coffee. If it is too strong, use less coffee.</li>
<li>If your coffee is still sweet and not bitter, increase the extraction by using a finer grind or longer brew time. Do this until you find the tipping point between bitter and sweet.</li>
<li>If your coffee is bitter, dial back the extraction. Again, try to find the tipping point. </li>
</ol>

<p>Manipulating the different variables that change your coffee will become second nature the more you do it. Start sharpening your coffee skills by being methodical with the way you experiment. Adjust only one variable at a time so you can see a clear cause and effect. Most importantly, don't let the pursuit of the perfect cup spoil the fun. Any cup of coffee is better than no cup at all, so enjoy the journey. </p>

<p>Kaldi was a herder who discovered his goats would become rambunctious after eating the berries and leaves of a plant. That plant turned out to be the coffee plant.</p>

<p>Upon observing this, Kaldi also partook of the plant's berries, finding it gave him extra energy. Some claim people would crush the berries and mix them with animal fat into rudimentary ""protein bars"".</p>

<p>Eventually they began drying-out the berries and steeping the seeds (beans) in hot water to brew the first coffee to grace the Earth. Thus begins the storied history of coffee consumption!</p>

<p>Another anecdote relating to coffee involves Pope Clement VIII. His advisors urged him to ban the consumption of coffee, likening it to the ""Devil's brew"" as it was popular among Muslims.</p>

<p><strong>However</strong>, after tasting coffee for the first time, the Pope was so impressed he couldn't bare to think of outlawing it. It's said this led to the spread of coffee drinking among Catholics and Italians in general.</p>

2847,2,,2016-05-23T03:53:40.500,1,,"<p>That's correct: as your cup cools, perceived acidity increases. This is due to variation in the chemical species affected by temperature. </p>

<p>Coffee is like ice cream. Ice cream is least sweet when it's stone cold, and tart and heavy when it has melted. Similarly, coffee is sweetest (and best) while it's hot, and is bitter or acrid when it has cooled. Furthermore, the cooler temp has led to chemical degradation and thus the awful taste. However, you won't perceive its flavors when the coffee is too hot -- so let it cool a bit.</p>

<p>As for your question whether the on-contact brew temperature affects end-result sweetness-sourness: there are a lot of baristas and coffee R&amp;D pros who do temperature-control brewing, especially for espresso, in order to modify the flavor of the coffee. </p>

<p>I believe that varying temperature affects coffee flavor in a gradient.</p>

<p>For cold brew (in case you're also curious about that), the cold temperature is a different environment entirely. Coffee is just as soluble, however less energetically kinetic, so more time is substituted for the lack of temperature. The end result is a brew product that functions naturally as a cold product -- nice, sweet, characteristic.</p>

<p>Many different acids are there in your cup: Malic, tannic acid, maleic, oleic, oxalic, caffeic, chlorogenic acids, etc. Also, the carbon dioxide that's produced when the organic molecules are reduced during roasting have an effect on acidity when it's solved in your final cup.

<p>He was a very fluent speaker in many languages including Ottoman Turkish.

<p>If you don't kill yourself, the next serious outcome is <strong>caffeine intoxication</strong>, caused by single doses of about half the LD50 or 400-500mg:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The symptoms of caffeine intoxication are comparable to the symptoms of overdoses of other stimulants: they may include restlessness, fidgeting, anxiety, excitement, insomnia, flushing of the face, increased urination, gastrointestinal disturbance, muscle twitching, a rambling flow of thought and speech, irritability, irregular or rapid heart beat, and psychomotor agitation.[95] In cases of much larger overdoses, mania, depression, lapses in judgment, disorientation, disinhibition, delusions, hallucinations, or psychosis may occur, and rhabdomyolysis (breakdown of skeletal muscle tissue) can be provoked.[99][100]<br>
  (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caffeine#Overdose"">Source</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Everything else is a question of your metabolism and caffeine tolerance vs. desired and undesirable effects. For example: coffee is a stimulant that counters fatigue and drowsiness - and thus can keep you awake if it's not metabolized when you want to sleep.</p>

<p>There is no general ""safety threshold"", but if you look at the recommendation of both the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Congress_of_Obstetricians_and_Gynecologists"">American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG)</a> and the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_Standards_Agency"">UK Food Standards Agency</a> for pregnant women, the 200mg caffeine per day deemed safe for them<sup>2</sup> should be more than safe for every other healthy adult. </p>

<hr>

<p><sup>1</sup> Sources vary between 5-30g, but LD50 rates for humans aren't exactly a field of much experimentation.</p>

<p><sup>2</sup> Pregnant women show a decreased caffeine metabolism (up to 15 hours vs. 3-4 hours in non-pregnant women) and there is a large safety margin to protect the unborn child.</p>

<p>Stirring is a bit like higher temperature, it moves around the molecules such that you are dissolving soluble compounds from the coffee.

<p>Convection ovens do sometimes dry out the food more, which can be analogous to stirring sometimes over extracting unwanted flavors like bitterness.</p>

<p>In brewing coffee it's all about your preferences. And I'm not just talking about taste. Speed can be a major factor. It is for me, which is why I use an AeroPress with a fine grind setting. I just make sure I don't let it brew very long nor do I use much pressure at all in order to keep the flavor where I want it.</p>

<hr>

<p>Most of the data reported in the present review may suggest that espresso brewing can be described as “a quick way to transfer carbon dioxide from roasted and ground coffee to a small cup by means of hot water under pressure”. This then leads to the facts that for espresso coffee, carbon dioxide has to be:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>generated by roasting</p></li>
<li><p>maintained in the bean by proper packaging</p></li>
<li><p>maintained in the ground coffee</p></li>
<li><p>solubilized in water</p></li>
<li><p>released into the beverage.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>In this framework statements such as “any error in grinding or in percolation, in temperature or extraction level, has an immediate effect on denounced by the color, the texture and the persistence of the foam” or “the foam is the signature of a well-prepared espresso” can be well justified. In fact, foam volume, persistence, and consistence are the consequences of the carbon dioxide content originally present in the coffee. In addition to the importance of carbon dioxide in espresso coffee foam, we believe that carbon dioxide can play a role even from a taste point of view.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Therefore; you need to find fresh nice Arabica beans, roast properly, degas for the correct amount of time, grind them well, brew appropriately with decent water right after grinding.</strong></p>

2870,2,,2016-06-02T17:55:41.340,1,,"<p>There are <em>many</em> ways to brew coffee, and several that are on the ""inexpensive"" end of the spectrum. Your tone sounds like you're not <em>very</em> into coffee, so to that end here are my broad recommendations in that will give you an adequate cup with minimal fuss and expense.</p>

<p><strong>You'll need two basic pieces of equipment:</strong></p>

<p><strong>A grinder</strong>. You can buy an inexpensive electric rotary grinder that will be adequate for most purposes -- one example <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B00006IUX5"" rel=""nofollow"">from Amazon</a>. You can also use it for grinding spices or seeds. If you already have one, you will get <em>some</em> odor holdover from one grinding mission to the next, but it's probably fine if you're not very picky. 10-15 quid new, or even cheaper used from a thrift shop etc. You can even mash them up with mortar and pestle.</p>

<p><strong>Some brewing mechanism</strong>. The cheapest and simplest are probably <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drip_brew"" rel=""nofollow"">drip brew</a> (e.g., pour-over or auto-drip), but I online a few more down below. Your options are manual pour-over (my recommendation) or auto-drip:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Manual pour-over</strong>. My pick would be a manual pour-over coffee cone, <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B0014CVEH6"" rel=""nofollow"">such as this one</a>, a plastic cone holder for like 5 quid. You put the cone over a mug, put in a paper filter, add medium-grind coffee (even as fine as the rotary grinder will give you will be okay), and slowly pour water over the top until brewed.</li>
<li><strong>Auto-drip</strong>. You can find a really cheap auto-drip machine, <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B001NXC5YC"" rel=""nofollow"">for instance this one from Amazon</a>, for like 10-15 quid, or even cheaper used. Water goes in the reservoir, paper filter in the basket, add some ground coffee, press the button.</li>
</ul>

<p>That's one solution for decent cup of coffee for as little as 15 quid all in (grinder, coffee cone, paper filters), or perhaps 25-30 for an auto-drip solution.</p>

This is often used in some fancy/kitchy coffee shops.  Otherwise a cheap coffee machine does basically do the trick as long as you find one that accurately heats the water.  </p>

<p>On the other hand if you want coffee with the oil left in(the paper filter removes the oil) a french press or percolator will be your cheapest option, or if you want to be able to do fancy ""coffee shop"" drinks (eg latte's, americano's, etc) then you have to bite the bullet and pay for an espresso machine, which tend to run a little more, and again you have to pay attention to the temperature that the machine runs at.  </p>

"<p>Gohan was the strongest in his mystic form back at the end of DBZ. How could Gohan have become so weak that he lost the ability to turn Super Saiyan 2 in such a short period of time? While on the other hand, Frieza was able to surpass Goku's Super Saiyan Blue transformation in only 4 months of training. That doesn't make sense.</p>

<p>Tagoma was even able to pierce him with a ki blast. Now he is losing left and right in every episode. Most recently Frieza in his base form was shooting ki blasts through Super Saiyan Gohan. So Frieza's base form is stronger than Super Saiyan now? How did that happen?</p>

  <p>How could be become so weak that cant even go super saiyan 2 anymore in a short period of time</p>
</blockquote>

<p>According to the <a href=""http://dragonball.wikia.com/wiki/Dragon_Ball_timelin"">timeline</a> of dragon ball, about 5 years have passed between the end the buu saga and the Resurection of F saga. Gohan hasn't trained at all since then. We can choose the analogy of professional athletes here: they need to train almost everyday to maintain their form, let alone get ""stronger"". After 5 years, it is expected than Gohan has become significantly weaker. But again, if he were to train for a few months, his power would probably go up exponentially. Also note that he did not train much in the Buu saga, much of his power increase came from the help of Supreme Kai.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>...while frieza surpasses goku SSB in 4 months of training</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Frieza states that he never had to train one day in his life because he was already so much stronger than everybody else. If we consider Goku to be a combat genius, imagine how much training and near-deaths experience he had to go through to be able to fight on par with Frieza. In the end, only Krilin's death helped become super saiyan and beat Frieza. Since he never trained before, it would make sense that his power would go up exponentially after little training. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Tagoma was even able to pierce him with a ki blast.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the movie ""Resurrection of F"" Goku in Super Saiyan blue was almost killed by a Sorbet's gun. This tells you that no matter how strong of a warrior you are, you can be defeated by someone so much weaker than you if you are caught by surprise.  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So frieza base is stronger than super saiyan now</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, when Gohan clearly states than he is no match of Frieza, he is still in his base form. Gohan might be able to sense Frieza's ki beyond his current form, but this is just speculation.</p>

"<p>Vegeta becomes a Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan (<em>Super Saiyan Blue</em>) in the movie Resurrection F. How did he become a Super Saiyan God? </p>

"<p>Like ton.yeung said, more detail takes more time and thus costs more money. In theory you could make an anime with every single frame having the same level of detail as a painting by Leonardo da Vinci, but it would be prohibitively expensive; it took Leonardo years to finish a single painting, and you would need a whole team of Leonardos churning out thousands of them in a limited timeframe. </p>

<p>That said, I doubt that it was significantly more expensive to animate Gantz than, say, K-On. The question seems to presuppose that cost is the only thing keeping anime from having more realistic facial art, but I believe it's more about artistry and style. The experience that Gantz was trying to create was drastically different from the experience that K-On was trying to create.  </p>

<p><a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/vSsT5m.jpg"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/vSsT5m.jpg"" alt=""gantz screenshot""></a>
<a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/DHqixm.jpg"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/DHqixm.jpg"" alt=""K-on screenshot""></a></p>

<p>The K-On characters <em>are</em> lacking some facial detail compared to the Gantz characters (in line with well-known rules of cuteness that, yes, seriously, have been studied and derived by anthropologists). Gantz uses smaller eyes, chunkier bodies, and a more subdued color palette; this makes it <em>seem</em> more realistic. However, we can see that both of them are lacking a lot of detail compared with, say, the work of American comics artist Alex Ross.</p>

<p><a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/1RkMtl.jpg"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/1RkMtl.jpg"" alt=""Alex Ross""></a></p>

<p>(I should note that Ross is primarily a cover artist, because of the time it takes him to produce works of such high detail. To create an animated feature at Ross's level of detail would be untenable.)</p>

<p>Also, shows like K-On and Clannad often have very detailed clothes, backgrounds, and other objects. Look at the instruments in K-On.</p>

<p><a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/oditam.jpg"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/oditam.jpg"" alt=""Azusa with guitar""></a>
<a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/cNbZVm.jpg"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/cNbZVm.jpg"" alt=""real guitar""></a></p>

<p><a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/tHh3e.png"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/tHh3e.png"" alt=""clannad kotomi garden""></a></p>

<p>So I don't think the difference in style is primarily about cost. It's about artistry. K-On was well enough funded to make its art look like Gantz had the creators wanted to; but that art style didn't fit with the goals and aesthetic sense of the series. It's the same reason Bugs Bunny looks like this:</p>

<p><a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/iaz2I.png"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/iaz2I.png"" alt=""bugs bunny""></a></p>

<p><a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/S3H02.jpg"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/S3H02.jpg"" alt=""photorealistic rabbit""></a></p>

<p>While the typical anime art style may have originally been created as cost-saving measure, that seems to be no longer the case. It is recognized as a unique style on its own and appreciated by many people on that basis, the same as the highly unnatural <a href=""http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/cube/hd_cube.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">Cubism</a> and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mannerism"" rel=""nofollow"">Mannerism</a> (which produced what seems to be the <a href=""https://mydailyartdisplay.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/longneck-reduced.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">first known forerunner of the Shaft head tilt</a>). </p>

It should be noted that some bloodlines in this series have special abilities and the Ackerman's seem to be one of these bloodlines.</p>

Mikasa then states that her parents met as fellow people who had been driven into the mountains and out of the cities and got married.

"<p>After reading over the <a href=""http://dragonball.wikia.com/wiki/Vegeta"" rel=""nofollow"">Wikia article</a> on Vegeta,it seems there is not a clear answer on how he gained his Super Saiyan God form. </p>

<p>Since <em>Dragon Ball Super</em> is canon, if in the episode Vegeta said that he obtained the form on his own I would assume that he is not lying about it. </p>

<p>In the <a href=""http://dragonball.wikia.com/wiki/Vegeta"" rel=""nofollow"">Wiki</a>, it is said that Vegeta went and trained with Whis for six months before Goku came to join him. It is most likely it was during this time that he obtained the Super Saiyan God form. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>After later gives Whis Ramen and he finds it delicious. He takes Vegeta in as his student and takes him to Beerus' planet to train him for six months. After six months has passed, he is waiting for Whis return from Earth. Whis has Goku along with him. Goku notes that Vegeta has gotten stronger and he may have surpassed him.</p>

"<p>All fruit users in one piece can use his fruits powers freely, the reason for Luffy and every other to put a name to all actions and shout it in battle is only a trope of the shonen style anime.</p>

<p>This fact can be checked by seeing Luffy ""loosing"" his head when he ate the fruit, or any logia user making his body ethereal without saying a word. Or moments when characters ""invoke"" the name after doing the action itself.</p>

"<p>After Goku arrived on Whis's planet, Vegeta and Goku had sparring training, while having hand to hand combat in an attempt to control their Ki. They somewhat triggered a blue aura which Whis pointed out in his mind as God Aura, right now Whis has thrown them in another dimension which is more like the Hyperbolic Time Chamber. I guess that place would grant them the key to attain SSGSS form. Do follow the DBZ Super manga for some story ahead. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It's for two reasons I know of:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li><strong>It completes her character arc. The entire reason she was such a mess at the beginning of the show and the whole reason she needed to learn through Ryuuji how to have basic interactions with other people without being a rude, condescending, violent bitch is because of her wrecked home life and broken upbringing.</strong> By the end of the show, she's matured a lot. When Ryuuji inadvertently damages his own home life in the last 2 episodes, Taiga watches him get up and fix it in a matter of days. <strong>It only makes sense for Taiga to decide at this point that she has to come full circle: She has to go face the issues that started all of her problems now that she's mature enough to do so. She has to go home and mend her relationship with her mother and step-siblings, and she does.</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Two, because it symbolizes equality in her relationship with Ryuuji. Throughout the show, their relationship is actually rather unhealthy, as Ami points out a number of times in the later episodes. Ryuuji is doting on Taiga and doing a lot of things for her that she should be doing for herself</strong>. Their relationship is more of a father/daughter relationship than one of equals (Ami also says this directly once). This is unhealthy for Ryuuji, too, as it feeds into his ""I have to take care of everything and everyone"" mindset, one he got from his own home life. <strong>Taiga leaves to fix her own shit, demonstrating her independence from Ryuuji as a capable person of her own, and Ryuuji accepts and respects her decision despite it hurting him, demonstrating that he acknowledges Taiga is an equal to him and not someone he needs to do everything for.</strong>
  The scene after the end credits, which you've hopefully watched by now, is almost between two new people. It's one of mature, equal people who truly understand each other.</li>
  </ul>

<p>It is never explicitly mentioned in the Light Novel or the anime as to what exactly she did during this time period. However, her note to Ryuuji:</p>

"<p>In the anime City Hunter, I am trying to find the episode where Saeko asks Ryo to go out with her.

"<p>The reason Miku usually has a leek with her most of the time when you see her, is because since she is a vocaloid, someone (I guess) wanted to make her sing Ievan Polkka, a Finnish song, and that's what got her popular at first. </p>

<p>*Luka </p>

<p>And as one of the answers already stated this, these vegetable pairings with Vocaloids came from the fans themselves, so it's not exactly official.</p>

<p>Actually, many Vocaloids (even UTAUs) have been associated with vegetables. Here are some examples:</p>

<p>Megurine Luka - Fish or Tuna
Kagamine Rin - Orange(s)
Kagamine Len - Banana(s)
KAITO - Ice cream
MEIKO - Sake (A traditional Japanese alcohol)</p>

<p>GUMI - Carrot(s)
Camui/Kamui Gakupo - Eggplant</p>

<p>(UTAU)</p>

<p>Kasane Teto - (French) Bread or a Baguette 
Namine Ritsu - Chocolate Crisps</p>

<hr>

<p>So Luka is paired with fish because she has a chibi head character who has hair like an octopus.</p>

<p>Rin with oranges because Len was paired with Bananas and since they're mirror images, the other closest fruit to him was an orange so they paired Rin with it instead.</p>

<p>Len was paired with a banana mostly because of his hair color and that piece of his hair sticking upwards resembles a banana, just a bit.</p>

<p>KAITO with ice cream because fans notice the scarf he wears and in his new V3 update, boots. People thought he seemed to wear winter-special clothes and since his hair is blue it easily resembles snow/ice and relating things, they decided his food was going to be Ice cream.</p>

<p>MEIKO with sake because she seemed to look older and mature so I guess they thought it'd be fun if they made her drunk (?) Not quite sure about this one.</p>

<p>GUMI with carrots because of her color scheme mostly, since she has green hair and orange official clothes so it reminds people of carrots.</p>

<p>Gakupo with Eggplant because he has purple hair and a stronger/deeper voice so I think it reminded them of an eggplant</p>

<p>Now, the UTAUs were officially paired with random foods because they were sorta supposed to be a parody April fool's joke. (?)</p>

<p>Here is a picture of them with the foods too:

"<p>The <a href=""http://dragonball.wikia.com/wiki/Super_Saiyan_God_Super_Saiyan"">Wikia page</a> states that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan , also known as Super Saiyan Blue, is the result of a Saiyan transforming into a Super Saiyan <strong>after absorbing and retaining the power of Super Saiyan God and training.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is,  that to achieve SSGSS,one must achieve and master SSG first.</p>

<p>However, as it wasn't done before Vegeta went off to train under Whis, the only options left are that either he performed the ritual on that planet, or his training with Whis helped him do so.The SSG form is just another Saiyan transformation, the only thing being different is that  instead of normal Ki, there is divine Ki flowing through your body and you can even perceive it now. As a result, you can even absorb energy attacks. As Vegeta said that he mastered the SSG form, I would believe it and would further add that by mastering the form he said that he mastered the perception and usage of the divine Ki, thus making it flow through his body evenly and unlocking the SSGSS form.</p>

<p>There is reference to this in the anime when he senses the return of Whis (<a href=""https://youtu.be/rM19sHdnvQU?t=3m7s"">watch here</a>), and later the oracle fish comments that he's finally able to sense divine Ki. Goku even states that Vegeta's Ki had changed a lot during the six months he had spent training under Whis (<a href=""https://youtu.be/rM19sHdnvQU?t=4m42s"">watch here</a>). </p>

<p>It's similar to that incident when Goku and Gohan had unlocked the Full Power Super Saiyan transformation after training in the hyperbolic time chamber in the cell saga. The FPSSJ transformation was the mastering of SSJ1 and making it the base form, thus reducing the strain on the body and making it easier to raise power levels. What they managed to do can be thought of controlling the SSJ1 Ki and making it flow evenly through their body, thus mastering the form. </p>

<p>The training both Goku and Vegeta are undergoing, which deals with raising power levels, a manifestation of Ki, without letting it leak, or, in other words, letting the opponent know,making each part of the body capable of independent action and also the perception and mastery of divine Ki, thus mastering SSG, SBG (Saiyan Beyond God) and SSB transformation.</p>

"<p>Zoro recently (in the anime) unleashed an impressive torrent of attacks using Busoshoku (Armament) Haki infused blades. This was not all that surprising but his flashback was (to me).</p>

<p>Zoro flashed back to both his training with Dracule Mihawk and his fight with him in the Baratie arc. Mihawks main blade, Yuro apparently, is clearly shown to be black through out this fight and the flashback stresses the fact that it is the strongest Black Blade.  Yet, the episode seems to say that Black Blade refers to swords turning black when infused with Haki.  As Mihawk is the strongest swordsmen, it seems guarenteed that the world's strongest ""Black Blade"" may or may not have anything to do with Yuro's color itself.</p>

<p>In addition, you can note that both replicas of Yuro we see (Mihawk's mini sword and the one wielded by the Mihawk-like monkey Zoro trained against) have silver blades.</p>

<p>This all leads to 3 closely inter related questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Did I understand this right? Does ""Black Blade"" refer to the sword or the technique?</li>
<li>Did Mihawk use Haki on Zoro so early in the series?</li>
<li>Does Yuro (as we've seen it but in universe) look black, silver, or does it vary person to person? What if Yuro is not wielded by Mihawk?</li>
</ul>
"
"<p>For all we, the audience know, the black color we see when people use Haki, could potentially be there solely to inform the audience of when it is being used.  This is reinforced by the fact that we never saw the black color before the timeskip despite seeing powerful Haki used by various characters.  I, however, wouldn't be surprised if the black color of Haki was acknowledged by the characters in-world, proving that it was actually a thing.</p>

<p>""Black blade"" refers to the sword, and yes the sword is black.  It is likely still black, even when Mihawk is not holding it, just like his coat is still red when he's not wearing it, etc.  </p>

<p>I kinda doubt that Oda had thought about Haki at the time Zoro fought Mihawk, but It's almost a certainty that Oda would retroactively say ""Yeah, that was Haki"".</p>
"
"<ul>
<li><p>Firstly, I would like to reply to this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In addition, you can note that both replicas of Yuro we see (Mihawk's mini sword and the one wielded by the Mihawk-like monkey Zoro trained against) have silver blades.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Mihawk's pocket knife, also known as <a href=""http://onepiece.wikia.com/wiki/Kogatana"" rel=""nofollow"">Kogatana</a> is not a replica of <a href=""http://onepiece.wikia.com/wiki/Yoru#cite_note-Saijo-0"" rel=""nofollow"">Yoru</a></strong>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>It is an ordinary knife, so bland and small that Mihawk enjoys demonstrating his skill with it.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>As for the Human Drill having the same sword as Mihawk, it was a filler.</strong> There is no mention of the Human Drills in the manga. Hence, it doesn't have much relevance to the story, and it's assumed that the sword carried by it is nothing but a replica. </p></li>
<li><p>From the One Piece Wiki page on <a href=""http://onepiece.wikia.com/wiki/Yoru"" rel=""nofollow"">Yoru</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>The blade itself is pitch-black with a very strong sheen</strong>..</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Some conclusive evidence in favor of this is:</p>

<ul>
<li>It has been black since the start of the series when the blackening effect of Haki wasn't introduced</li>
<li>It is black even when it's on Mihawk's back</li>
<li>As you pointed out, if it were Haki, even Mihawk's short knife would have appeared black in color to the audience.</li>
<li>It's not the only black sword shown in the series. Zoro's <a href=""http://onepiece.wikia.com/wiki/Shusui"" rel=""nofollow"">Shusui</a> is also shown to be black in color (and in this case, it's definitely not the Haki that makes it black).</li>
</ul>

</ul>

<p><strong>Hence, I'm inclined to say that it refers to the sword rather than the  technique.</strong></p>

<hr>

<p>Based on this image:</p>

<p><a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/4p0S5.png"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/4p0S5.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p><strong>It may have been clad in Haki even during the earliest part of the series, but I doubt that he actually used Haki against Zoro during their first fight, simply because he didn't have to. We saw him defeat Zoro using his short knife, so there was no need for him to actually worry about getting his sword nicked.</strong></p>

<p>However, there's no conclusive evidence on this. It may have been clad in Haki or it may have not. I believe that it wasn't.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Yuro being a black sword appears black even in-universe. Tashigi even describes it as a Black Sword, although I don't seem to remember in which chapter. Not only that, the name of the sword is ""Yoru"", which means ""Night"" and can also be translated as ""Black Sword"".</strong></p>

"<p>So i have the anime <em>Persona Trinity</em> and the only other Shin Megami Tensei Persona anime i know of is an adaption of the 4th game but to my knowledge there is no <em>Persona Trinity</em> game.</p>

"<p><em>Disclaimer: I've only watched the anime.</em></p>

<p>When Yato gave Yukine a name, he immediately started suffering from all his ""sins"" and eventually an Ablution had to be performed to save both's lives.</p>

<p>Then why is it that he is not affected by Nora's actions? Unless he un-named her, which hasn't been mentioned. Either way, why doesn't he seek to kill her and end all these side problems that emerge because of her?</p>

<p>I am not entirely through with season 2, but similarly Kugaha's case confuses me too. </p>

<p>If anyone has answers, I'd appreciate them. Also, I don't care about spoilers, rather the opposite, if possible I wanna understand everything beforehand. This show sure is good, but it makes some mistakes in regards to explaining basic logic.</p>

"<p>As ton.yeung and I have stated in our comments, the <a href=""http://noragami.wikia.com/wiki/Blight"">Blight</a> forms based on the guilt of the <a href=""http://noragami.wikia.com/wiki/Shinki"">Shinki</a>, therefore, if the shinki was committing sins under the notion that it was wrong, blight would occur, like in Yukine's case of destroying the school windows and stealing. But in Kugaha's case, he believed what he was doing to be for Bishamon's sake as shown in this scene.</p>

"<p>In chapter 76 of the manga of Attack on Titan, it appears that the Survey Corps. have killed Reiner Braun. I don't understand why they killed him, especially when they needed information from him. </p>
"
"<p>It's about a boy who falls in love with a princess who makes a deal to save her life she must lose all memory of him. He has to go and collect memory fragments in the form of feathers and each one she remembers more.</p>
"
"<p>To begin with, it's not certain that Reiner is actually dead, the final frame of the manga shows the Armored Titan suffering intense damage, but as we haven't yet seen his corpse, it's best not to draw conclusions - he did just survive being half decapitated after all!</p>

<p>Secondly, even if he were to die, there is still the Colossal and Beast Titans that would be in possession of the same or similar information. As mentioned in Yokhen's comment, Annie too is in captivity and remains a potential source of information should she ever awaken. And as mentioned in Astral Sea's comment, it is believed that the information they need is in Eren's basement anyway.</p>

<p>Thirdly, and maybe most importantly, one of the Survey Corps. major objectives is the elimination of the duo that breached the wall in the first instance, as all other walls are in danger while they remain free. Therefore,  in Erwin's eyes at this time, the deaths of Reiner and Bertolt are likely far more advantageous than having them alive for questioning:</p>

  <p><strong>Synopsis</strong> <em>(taken from the site itself)</em></p>
  
  <p>During an excavation at the mysterious ruins in Clow Country, Syaoran
  discovers his childhood friend Princess Sakura appear on the site with
  wings that disperse into many feathers. As the feather's disappear to
  different dimensions, so does Sakura's memory. In attempts to save
  Sakura's life and restore her memory, Syaoran travels through to
  another world to find a solution. There's only one thing left he can
  do. Travel through to different dimensions to collect Sakura's
  feathers. Helping out with the quest is Kurogane, an exiled ninja from
  Japan Country who wishes to return to his world, the runaway magician,
  Fay, who desires to jump between each world never to return to his own
  and the white meat-bun shaped creature, Mokona.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think it fits the bill almost perfectly. As the synopsis points out, he <strong>falls in love with Princess</strong> Sakura, who loses her wings and are dispersed into many <strong>feathers</strong> which go to several worlds/dimensions, all of this <strong>causing her to lose her memory</strong>. It fails to mention anything about the deal, but as for everything else, I believe it's a dead giveaway.</p>

"<p>In <em>Dragon Ball Z</em>, when Goku was fighting Kid Buu, there were many enemies watching him from Hell.</p>

"<p>Many times throughout the series Naruto did manifest a cloak in the same way so the other hosts:</p>

<li>When he was fighting Pain after Hinata got attacked, 4-9 Tail Cloak</li>
</ul>

<p>What is different for him, is that he is a Sage, and to my knowledge, none of the other hosts are Sages. After he learned Sage mode AND reflected on his inner evil, he gained that form; see the fight with Pain, he was using Sage mode then.</p>

<p>Based on all of this, I think that this is something 'unique' to him (except that his father can do it too...) because of him combining Sage training and Kyuubi's power.</p>

"<p>I can think of several anime series with recurring characters who I would classify as ""snot-nosed kids"".  Two sympathetic, recurring, characters are Udon from <em>Naruto</em> and Komugi from <em>Hunter x Hunter</em>.  Is there an actual trope for this character trait, and if so, what is it meant to imply?  To me (American), the trait merely means someone I don't really want to look at.</p>

<p>Surely there is more than that, though.  Sort of like a bloody nose often means the character is somehow sexually embarrassed.</p>

"<p>We know that she has spent a lot of time with Yato (because they've shown to be together since childhood and Hiiro was his first Regalia) and also really cares about him. Yato himself says:</p>

<p>This means that Hiiro does care about Yato and has never done anything which she thought wasn't for the good of Yato. Just before this scene, we also see Hiiro saying that she wouldn't mind dying in the underworld as long as Yato was with her.</p>

<p>So why is it that she is a Nora? Why did she allow other Gods to name her?</p>

"<p>As stated in the Wikia article on <a href=""http://dragonball.wikia.com/wiki/Hell"">Hell</a> (emphasis mine):</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Hence, it's an anime inconsistency which is not the fault of Akira Toriyama. One can only assume that the scene was not taken into account in <em>Dragon Ball Super</em> because they adapted it from the manga and didn't take into account the anime-added filler. </p>

"<p>She's first named by his father (the ""sorcerer"" is mentioned as her true master in the wiki so I suppose that means he named her first) as Mizuchi and then his father let Yato name her as Hiiro.</p>

<p>I think she never tainted Yato  because she cares for Yato so much that she never did anything a regalia shouldn't do to taint their master.</p>

<p>I haven't read that far in the manga so I can only suspect that the sorcerer allows her to be named by others for some sinister plan against the heavens.</p>

"<p>Before I describe what little more about it I know, let me clear two things up. I will be referring to a ""virus"", but I don't know what it actually is. I may sometimes say Gundam instead of mech. That's because I just spent 30 minutes looking up Gundam, not because it's a Gundam anime (although it might be).</p>

<p>So, I know it's a mech anime. When they enter the mech, they pass through a circle that applies a form fitting suit that they use to control the mecha. (I'm actually not totally sure about this).</p>

<p>One of the episodes involved a conference and/or other group of people collected together talking about the ""virus"". One of the attendees is infected (and there's something about them they have to hide to prevent people from finding this out).</p>

<p>The ""virus"" bas stages (I think) eventually takes over the infected (while they are in a mecha), and the infected loses control (becomes controlled?). If I recall correctly, the inside of the mecha now looks like a fleshy hell pit created by the ""virus"".</p>

<p>I'm fairly certain it was on Toonami. I'm 100% certain it was on T.V. in the US sometime between 1998 and 2005.</p>

  <p>As they encounter Gundam pilots who had come in contact with the Dark
  Gundam, Domon and Rain learn of its unique cellular properties to
  regenerate, multiply, and <strong>evolve by infecting organic matter and
  causing violent behavior in living things.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So we know that this anime is about mechas and there is a virus thing, namely the Dark Gundam, that has abilities to corrupt organic matter and evolve in/with it (or something along those lines).</p>

<p>Then as I searched for footage of the anime, I came upon this video of the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CLIHBOCJPM"">first episode</a> which in its first seconds shows the character going through a <strong>circle</strong> in order to wear a <strong>suit</strong>, just like you also told.</p>

<p>I'm not sure about <strong>the meeting</strong> part, for I haven't watched it, but as for everything else you've told, it's a dead giveaway.</p>

"<p><strong>Note: After reading the A&amp;M rules and a few related questions, it would appear that I am not violating the ""back your sources"" rule as this is a speculation question, which appears to be allowed (see <a href=""http://meta.anime.stackexchange.com/questions/2483/"">Is a question that asks about a future event on-topic?</a>). Either way, my answer is the following:</strong></p>

<p>Knowing that One Piece is a Shōnen Manga (Main characters not dying easily is one of the trends) and that Sanji is fairly popular, here's what I can come up with:</p>

<p>My best candidate:</p>

<ul>
<li>Sanji broke his leg(s) with one too many <code>Diable Jambe</code>

<ul>
<li>Will probably have a <em>Miraculous Recovery</em> later on</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Other possibilities:</p>

<ul>
<li>Sirens/Mermaids saved him when the ship fell in pieces, current location unknown.</li>
<li>Temporarily Dead</li>
</ul>

<p>In the unlikely case that Sanji is dead, here is what could have happened:</p>

<ul>
<li>A Kraken (or other <em>Mysterious Being From The Sea</em>) finished him</li>
<li>One of the Kaido crewmen escaped and wanted revenge</li>
<li>Ate a devil fruit and drowned.</li>
<li>(Comical) Ate a devil fruit, got rescued by a mermaid, but died of nosebleed.</li>
</ul>

<p>To answer point #5, Luffy believes in Sanji. Following the Shōnen archetype, when the main character says it'll be okay, it'll be okay. If sanji broke a leg, he'd probably crack a joke about having rubber bones, or something.</p>

"<p>Any explanation as to why the imaginary friend of Afro was a ninja even though Afro was a samurai? Or was it just for characterization purpose? </p>
"
"<p>In the latest chapter of the Manga, Chapter 147, Souma beats Eizan in a shokugeki. The terms were for Eizan to stop destroying the Polar Star Dorm, but does Souma get to also usurp Eizan's position in the Elite 10 as the no. 9 spot (I believe Eizan is number 9 but not sure) because he beat him in a shokugeki? Or is there not enough information to answer?</p>
"
"<blockquote>
  <p>Each side must lay out their ""compensation"", or something they must give up if they were to lose the challenge. Both sides must agree that the compensation of the duel equate with each other.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href=""http://shokugekinosoma.wikia.com/wiki/Shokugeki"" rel=""nofollow"">http://shokugekinosoma.wikia.com/wiki/Shokugeki</a></p>

<p>I guess the battle will only save the polar star dorm. Originally, whatever they bet before the Shokugeki is what they'll get when they win. This means if Souma wants to dethrone him, he'll need to propose another battle asking for the position if he wins.</p>

<p>But we'll see on the next chapter what would be the outcome.</p>
"
"<p>First of all : <strong>Ninja Ninja is the imaginary friend</strong> of Afro.<br /><br />
<a href=""http://afrosamurai.wikia.com/wiki/Ninja_Ninja"" rel=""nofollow"">Wiki</a> quotted:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ninja Ninja (ニンジャニンジャ, Ninja Ninja) is likely to be a figment of Afro's imagination to cope with severe psychiatric trauma from unbearable sights and actions of death. Being that Afro is an emotionless murderer, his mind may well have created Ninja Ninja to hold his other emotions excluding Anger and hatred ; He often hangs with Afro as his self-appointed ""Road Dog"". Another possible understanding of Ninja-Ninja that would also be relevant to his regular Buddhist inspired spiritual practices is that Ninja Ninja represents Afro's ""[Mind""], which tries to affect Afro through voicing doubts and fears. Contrasting Ninja Ninja against Afro's actions in this context gives Afro a different set of characteristics. As to say, he has fears, doubts and anxieties yet continues onward in spite of them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><br />
A canonical reference which you yourself can veruify is the in <strong>Episode 5</strong>, precisely at <strong>14m 05s</strong>, <a href=""http://afrosamurai.wikia.com/wiki/Justice"" rel=""nofollow"">Justice</a> quotted :</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I almost chuckled when you killed that imaginary friend of yours!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Referring to the act where Afro killed Ninja-Ninja but no blood splattered.
<br /><br /></p>

<p>Now to add to the wiki, notice the contradictions in the two characters:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Afro</strong> : Calm, Composed, Risk-taker,lives life on the edge</li>
<li><strong>Ninja Ninja</strong> : Afraid of all combats, high levels of anxiety, unconfident, slacky, always after them booties</li>
</ul>

<p>Noticing these two character differences, its safe to say that Ninja Ninja is the <strong>altered ego</strong> of the Afro's real self. He's a part of Afro that he himself refuses to acknowledge as a part of himself and treats it as somebody else. Why? Because of the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bushido"" rel=""nofollow"">Bushido or the Samurai Code</a>. He can't allow himself (a samurai) to be unconfident, slacky, pervy or heave a loose attitude. Therefore, he is tempted and warned and mocked by Ninja Ninja time and again, here and there.
<br />
<br />
Another reason I thought of was and which is mentioned in wiki itself is that all the burden of killing and slaughtering mercilessly could drive a person insane! He has to keep his mind off any such distractions. That's is another reason of existence of Ninja Ninja.
<br />
<br />
Now to answer you question as to why he could interact with real world objects :<br/>  He interacted with the same objects that Afro touched. Here are some instances : 
<br/></p>

<ol>
<li><p>In Resurrection he commented how awful the steak was! At the same time Afro was having the steak but he (being a Samurai after all) shouldn't be complaining about such things but his altered ego did it for him to keep Afro calm!</p></li>
<li><p>He killed or discarded his Altered ego in ressurrection by dodging a poisoned needle in such a way it hit Ninja-Ninja, and also in the first season he killed it when he was about to face formidable enemies to prevent any second thoughts or distractions!
<br/>
And I don't remember if he was ever noticed by any other character in the anime.(Tell me on which episode at what time if I'm mistaken)</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Hope this seems reasonable!</p>

<li><p><em>Die Gefängnis</em> — <em>The prison.</em> They got the article wrong, it should be <em>das.</em> I don’t know why none of the production crew could look the word up in a dictionary when they did so well with everything else (even umlauts). But whatever. The title of course references the prison the dolls and Jun are in in Souseiseki’s master’s dream.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Abschied</em> — <em>Farewell,</em> preparing for Shinku’s departure into the N-field.</p></li>

"
"<p>Preface: This is coming entirely from the anime’s perspective and yet without the 2013 one, which I've only started watching.</p>

<p>We are introduced to Shinku, Hina-Ichigo, Suigintou, Suiseiseki and Souseiseki in the first season in order of appearance. Bara-Suishou and Kanaria are introduced in the first and third episodes of <em>Träumend,</em> respectively. During episode 1 of <em>Träumend</em>, Shinku explicitly refers to herself as the fifth Rozen Maiden doll, and Bara-Suishou answers to the seventh.</p>

<p>In episode 1 of the OVA <em>Ouvertüre</em>, we learn that Shinku then only knew about three Rozen Maiden dolls at the time of <em>Ouvertüre.</em> However, for some reason, she knows that there should be seven. Also in that episode, Shinku gets to know Suigintou for the first time.</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> She finds out, that Suigintou is broken and initially does not even have a <em>Rosa Mystica</em> thus concluding that she shouldn’t be a Rozen Maiden. However in the second OVA episode, Suigintou has been restored after defeat and granted a <em>Rosa Mystica,</em> obviously making her a true Rozen Maiden.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In episode 12 of <em>Träumend,</em> we learn that</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Bara-Suishou was not an original <em>Rozen Maiden</em> but rather an <em>Enju Maiden</em> being crafted by a different doll maker. It is not clearly revealed as far as I can tell whether she has a <em>Rosa Mystica</em> but she cannot cope with winning the Alice game and thus the other six girls’ <em>Rosa Mysticas,</em> possibly because she is not pure enough. In any case, the situation is restored to a pre-Alice-game situation where only those dolls defeated by Rozen Maidens stay defeated: Hina-Ichigo and Souseiseki (by Shinku and Suigintou).<br>
<br>
 I conclude from these facts, that Bara-Suishou is quite a bit younger than the other dolls.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Therefore, the dolls must somehow know that there are seven of them but not who they are until they met each other.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Why did they know that they must be seven?</p></li>
<li><p>How and why did they know the how many-th doll they are?</p></li>
<li><blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> How was it possible that <em>none</em> of the six met the seventh <em>proper</em> Rozen Maiden in the over 100 years that they had been living and fighting all over the world, so that they all assumed Bara-Suishou to be the proper seventh?</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Shouldn’t there have been any clues for the other dolls that Bara-Suishou is ‘non-canonical’? E.g. the scene at the end of <em>Träumend</em> 10 where they meet Enju and call him <em>father.</em></p>

"<p>The question ""How and how much do the dolls know about the other dolls?"" is hard to answer by the anime perspective.</p>

<p>The anime storyline started to differ from the original manga storyline, and the differences became great enough that they can be considered different works.</p>

<p>Not many details are included about the dolls' past in the anime, and the plot offered in both <em>Träumend</em> and <em>Ouvertüre</em> was discontinued, as they were animation original plots, not related to the manga storyline, so what we have seen is all we have to try and deduce answers for that specific scenario.</p>

<p>The second manga series advanced the manga story, and gave more information about the Rozen Maiden's past. And it contradicts and negates the information given by <em>Ouvertüre</em>.</p>

<p>It is revealed that, at first, the dolls all lived together in what they called ""The Miniature Garden"", altought it was more of a big deposit than a real garden. They spent time together, playing around.</p>

<p>Yet, events happened, and while they expected their creator to be making a seventh doll, neither the seventh nor their creator ever appeared, and as they started to question wether they had ben abandoned and forgotten, LaPlace appeared before them and started the Alice Game.</p>

<p>So, by the manga plot, the six know maidens all knew about each other, because they lived together as sisters before the game began. But they never knew if a seventh really existed.</p>

<p>But the manga plot also does not have a Bara-Suishou. She exists only for the anime plot.</p>

<p>As for the actual seventh doll, the reason none of the maidens met her over the years, is because the seventh doll did not have a real body, so she was not able to properly participate in the game.</p>

<p>Sorry, but since I still haven't finished reading the manga, this is all I know at the moment.</p>

"<p>Anime seasons are <em>generally</em> 12/13 episodes long. There are quite a number of exceptions though, where more or fewer episodes are fitted into the same timeslots. Most notably, however, a season can have 11,12 or 13 episodes a season. I've seen this discrepancy occur regularly.</p>

<p>I would have thought that keeping the episode amount standard is good for keeping the seasons aligned &mdash; 52 weeks in a year / 4 seasons in a year = 13 episodes per season. The variant I see most is 12 episodes at a time or 12 episodes with a bonus DVD-only OVA. What do they do with the 1 week gap?</p>

<p>Do stations plan their seasons far enough in advance to make it even out overall? What if a show is cancelled?</p>

<p><strong>Why does this anomaly exist?</strong> Surely it makes it awkward to schedule TV.</p>
"
"<p>This seems to happen in most regions. The typical reasons I've seen given are:</p>

<ul>
<li>shows don't all start on the same day or even the same week</li>
<li>sometimes airtime slots are occupied by sports, seasonal, or other non-regular programs</li>
<li>networks may choose not to broadcast new episodes on holidays with historically low viewership</li>
<li>shows are sometimes only given an awkward number of slots <a href=""http://finance.yahoo.com/news/cbs-adds-7-more-episodes-005636930.html"">like SuperGirl here</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>I would also hope that some studios choose to show more or less episodes to ensure they have the right pacing and tell the whole story without an obnoxious amount of filler.</p>

<p>I imagine networks know pretty far in advance what their lineup will look like. Pilot episodes or other proposal material is submitted to the network far in advance for them to review before agreeing to broadcast.

"<p>Actually, anime airing is usually divided in 4 ""seasons"" each year, following the earth's seasons. TV schedules get defined only close to the start of next season, and usually there are shows which were supposed to air that won't or they might get delayed. </p>

<p>Also, most of the time shows don't start airing on the same day/week within a season, and might get a one-week break during the season (i.e. non-planned event on TV, holiday in Japan). </p>

<p>To answer your question, anime TV scheduling isn't done that much in advance, and is honestly a complicated mess. TV networks won't plan a year ahead because they still don't know which series they are going to air and when they will be ready, so having a different number of episodes per show doesn't really screw up their scheduling.</p>

"<p>The following anwer is made by assuming that they are playing on a Bomberman version similar to one of those which actually exist. </p>

<p>A proof that this may be similar to a known version of Bomberman is the bonus Ayano is trying to pick up, which looks really similar to <a href=""http://bomberman.wikia.com/wiki/Fire"" rel=""nofollow"">Fire</a> and  <a href=""http://bomberman.wikia.com/wiki/Full_Fire"" rel=""nofollow"">Full Fire</a>  bonuses</p>

<h3>Basic Bomberman knowledge</h3>

<p>In the classic games Bomberman, there are a lot of <a href=""http://bomberman.wikia.com/wiki/Power-Ups"" rel=""nofollow"">power-ups</a>. </p>

<p>One in particular, <a href=""http://bomberman.wikia.com/wiki/Kick"" rel=""nofollow"">Kick</a>, gives to the one who collected it the ability to kick away Bombs. This is the only ability that grants the power to move a bomb after it has been planted.</p>

<p>This may be used in 2 ways :</p>

<ul>
<li>To eject the bomb that would threaten your life;</li>
<li>To push an enemy bomb or <strong>your bomb</strong> into the enemy's face.</li>
</ul>

<p>What's more, it is important to know that bomb explose after a determined delay after it has been planted. </p>

<hr>

<h3>But what happend exactly?</h3>

<p>Ayano did plant a bomb in order to destroy a wall and therefore is unable to move (if she does, she may be killed by her own bomb)</p>

<p><a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/p2PKY.png"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/p2PKY.png"" alt=""Ayano blocked""></a></p>

<p>After the wall exploded, Ayano's first reflex was to leave this dead-end to pick-up a bonus.</p>

<p><a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/jy9hd.png"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/jy9hd.png"" alt=""Ayano picking bonus""></a></p>

<p>Toshino may have anticipated that Ayano would have this behavior. </p>

<p>Toshino planted a bomb near to herself, managing to time it so it would explode just a little bit after Ayano's bomb. Then she pushed the bomb with the bonus we talked about earlier (we can be sure of this as long as the ability to move bombs is unique to this bonus) and killed Ayano.</p>

<hr>

<h3>Why is Yui reacting this way?</h3>

<p>Bomberman is usually meant to be played around strategy, which means placing your bombs in order to force the enemy players' movements, and therefore block them. 
As an example, placing a bomb on a line will force a player to go to the other end of this line. By playing on this kind of <em>forcing</em>, you can ""<em>place</em>"" enemies on a dead-end or a really close place where they are more vulnerable to bombs.</p>

<p>The natural reaction of an awared Bomberman player is to spend the less possible time in dead-ends. They are deadly because <strong>you cannot go through bombs unless you have the <a href=""http://bomberman.wikia.com/wiki/Bomb_Pass"" rel=""nofollow"">Bomb Pass bonus</a></strong>.</p>

<p>Here, Toshino is just waiting for enemies to destroy walls in order to kill them instead of placing bombs herself.</p>

<p>Therefore, this kind of trick can be seen as unfair or dirty because it is playing on a survival reflex and is not really the part of a global strategy. </p>

<p>There is a shrine or temple and someone is carrying boxes. They trip or something and these beads fall out. The beads do something that makes the character crazy and not too far off is a couple people reading under a tree. Then a fight breaks out.</p>

<p>The Shrine/Temple was not the main setting of the anime and one of the people under the tree was maybe a little girl.</p>

<p>I believe the person carrying the boxes was a girl with purple hair and the beads were some type of jewellery. I think they were absorbed making her angry or jealous to the point of fighting someone at/near the tree.</p>

<p>I want to say it was a fantasy type setting but I don't remember monsters or such however there is more fighting with magic or magic like abilities.</p>

<p>I watched it only a few years back maybe like 2013, but I'm not certain though it had a ""newer"" art style. </p>

""Japanese folklore states that the ninja descended from a demon that was half man and half crow. However, it seems more likely that the ninja slowly evolved as an opposing force to their upper-class contemporaries, the samurai, in early feudal Japan.""

Ninjutsu versus Bushido:</p>

<p>Ninjutsu developed as an opposing force to the samurai code of bushido. Samurai valued loyalty and honor above all else. Going into battle, a samurai would select a single opponent, announce his challenge, list his family pedigree, and then attack. Samurai wore bright colors on their armor to announce their clan identity. Ideally, at least, bushido was noble and highly stylized, but it couldn't always get the job done.</p>

<p>That is where ninjutsu came in: the ninja code valued accomplishing a mission by whatever means necessary. Sneak attacks, poison, seduction and spying were all shameful to the samurai, but fair play by the rules of the ninja.""</p>

<p>I believe that the 'too much chakra' explanation was a fan-theory.</p>

<p>To try and answer the question, I believe that the reason that Naruto passed is because he learned the Kage Bunshin technique. It is a much more complex (and dangerous) technique, which can be seen by the fact that is Forbidden technique. But even so, the Kage Bunshin is still a Bunshin technique.</p>

"<p>Slight spoilers for Tsukimonogatari</p>

<p>It is explained that Kagenui (and another character specific to Tsukimonogatari) had a curse put onto them which prevents them from touching the ground. There's little-to-no mention as to what happens if Kagenui ever does touch the ground, but either way, with the amount of dedication she takes to never stepping on it, it seems to be something relatively serious.</p>

<p>If I remember correctly, this curse was put onto her and the other character for their work on bringing Ononoki into being (as in, in the form she is now).</p>

<p>About her walking on the floor of the cram school ruins, I'd say it's probably because it's the floor of a building, not the actual ground. She's able to walk on structures built on the ground, just not the ground itself.</p>

"<p>As you say, there are enough weeks in a year for there to be four 13-episode parts. This is true, and each of these parts is a season. However, there aren't always exactly 13 days of each day of the week in season. For example, the summer 2016 season (July-September) will have 14 Saturdays.</p>

<p>As to why shows go for 12 or 13 episodes, it's generally something the anime production companies decide early on in creating an anime (a few months prior to the show airing). Different studios and shows will have their reasons, but either way, there we are. Unless we were there when the decision was made in some board room, we don't know why a show got 12 episodes over 13.</p>

<p>When the planned season where the show will be airing is about to start, the anime production companies will call the TV stations and ask for time slots. (Generally, TV stations themselves aren't involved in producing anime, only just putting them on TV.) For example, one will call to say ""we want to air a show on Saturday nights at 24:30 for the next 12 Saturdays"". Another will call asking ""we want to air a show on Thursday nights at 24:00 for the next 13 Thursdays"". Whether or not they get the slot depends entirely upon whether or not someone else took it yet (and if the price for the slot is worth it).</p>

<p>Anime TV scheduling is competitive, as is a number of things in the anime production world. Anime production companies will try to be as quick as they can about getting a TV slot, but it usually isn't until relatively close to the start of the anime season that TV stations get a full schedule figured out. TV stations can count on their slots being filled, though, with the wide amount of anime coming out each season nowadays (and they can always rely on reruns otherwise).</p>

<p>So, to sum it up, anime production companies know from early on how many episodes they want. How they decide that is dependent upon the show. When it comes to the TV stations, they just offer up the time slots, that's it. The anime companies take them as soon as they can, for as many nights as they want them.</p>
"
"<p>My guess is to save themselves money. Dubbing a song in English always seemed to be a rare thing anyway. Anime licensing/dubbing companies here in the US are always trying to skimp as much as they can, to keep themselves in the black.</p>

<p>It takes them extra time and money to find a singer to sing the song in English, get access to the instrumental version of the song (unless they decide to create their own instrumental, which is even more expensive), give the singer time to learn and practice the song, and then get them in to record said song.</p>

<p>The alternative is just leaving the song as it is, in Japanese, and slapping on subtitles for the lyrics.</p>

<p>For these companies, it just isn't worth the hassle. When they do it, it's because they believe the show will sell better this way.</p>
"
"<p>I'd pretty much say that they just find someone else to fill the role. A decent number of voice actors audition for a role, but of course only one gets the part. If something unfortunate like that happens, the production companies can, without much difficulty, find someone else to fill the slot.</p>

<p>It's kind of heartless to say that yeah, our favorite seiyuu is replaceable, but unfortunately, it's how business works. </p>

<p>Anime production companies generally won't change how they do a story or cancel a series because of something like this. When a voice actor passes away, an anime studio may already have the next 2, 3, or so episodes already animated in some form, and even more with a written script; to go back and change all those drawings/animations to write out a character is time-consuming and expensive. Frankly, it has to be someone much more crucial to the show's production to die for the companies to begin even considering these options.</p>

  <p> That Natsu is Zeref's brother!</p>

<p><strong>Can someone please help me by telling me which manga I need to read first and what is the order of the others?</strong></p>

<p>And</p>

<p>If possible, <strong>Can someone explain the labelling ""Fairy Tail 465 - 400 Years""?</strong> so that I know what to look out for in the future, to prevent spoiling it for myself.</p>

"<p>Well it is hard determine the age as the dragon slayers have come from 400 years in the past.Technically Natsu is about 417-419 years old</p>

"<p>Being a long time fan of Kazuki Takahashi's Yu-Gi-Oh! series, I tried to looking into any manga that he may have produced after the completion of Yu-Gi-Oh! (Millenium World), but it seems like he just stopped writing manga after that.</p>

"<p>You should read the chapters in order from Chapter 1 to the latest. On the majority of the websites they will put the latest characters (based on chapter number) towards the top of the page.</p>

<p>As for your second question: Fairy Tail 465 - 400 Years; means the that is chapter 465 of the series, and the title of that particular chapter is '400 years'.</p>

<p>As an FYI to you, there are several other Fairy Tail series that are pseudo-canon (or fully canon) related to the main story. Some of them are written by the same author of the core series. Just be warned that some of them have spoilers for historic events of the main series, but they are all really good.</p>

"<p>Sometimes I have difficulty understanding Holo and Lawrence's wit, such as in this conversation on pages 48-49 of volume 9 of the light novels:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Holo: Aye, we're all greedy, always running about in service of our own gain.</p>
  
  <p>Lawrence: On that count, I'm forced to agree. Of course...Of course, if I weren't so greedy, I'd be able to buy you tastier food.</p>
  
  <p>Holo: Mm. But is seeing my pleasure not in your interests as well?</p>
  
  <p>Lawrence: If you were truly so easily bribed by food, then that might be so.</p>
  
  <p>Holo: And what other methods could you use?</p>
  
  <p>Lawrence: If food is out, then with words or manners.</p>
  
  <p>Holo: Neither of which is so reliable in your case.</p>
  
  <p>Lawrence: (<em>Quoting Eve</em>) Or you could imagine you've been deceived and decide to trust both. They might well turn out to be genuine.</p>
  
  <p>Holo: That isn't what I meant to say.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They were originally talking about Holo's attempt to get a narwahl, but then it branched off into this conversation.</p>

<p>With line 8, Lawrence feels that he has effectively put Holo in a corner. The text also mentions that line 8 is something Eve previously said. The text then states that Holo has no counterattack. However, when Holo makes her reply with line 9, Lawrence feels like she has done something unfair. I am uncertain as to why Lawrence feels as though he has won, and as to why he feels that Holo was unfair with line 9. </p>

<p>As we can see, there are two pucks on a single hockey table. They collide and goal. It doesn't look like one came flying from another table. As I know there will be only one puck in a single game on a table. So what is going on in this part? Does air hockey have different gameplay rules in Japan? </p>

"<p>A typical air hockey match consists of using two pushers and one puck. And as @jphager2 suggests in his comment, there's no need for a net in an air hockey match, hence, it could be a multi-purpose table.</p>

<p>So what's the deal with two pucks? Now, in that Chapter, Raku and Chitoge had a lot of fun in the arcade. And the bill had to be a decent amount. So instead of someone willingly agreeing to pay the bill, they keep a match on condition that the loser has to pay for all the games. </p>

<p>Since the the stakes were high, it is most likely that they used two pucks to increase the difficulty of the game. </p>

"<p>I have been watching the English dub of it on public TV and I haven't seen any mention of <em>K-On</em> in the series itself (with the exception of the OPs/EDs).</p>

<p>So I am wondering, what does K-On refer to in the series? If it refers to nothing, then is there a particular reason/meaning to the name K-On?</p>
"
"<p>""K-On"" is pronounced the same as the word 軽音 <em>keion</em>, which means ""light music"" (in the Japanese sense, not the classical sense). The main characters are, of course, part of the light music club, which is the 軽音部 <em>keion-bu</em>. The ""K-On club"", if you will.</p>

<p>If you had watched it with Japanese audio, you would have probably noticed the word sprinkled all over the place (since they talk about the club a lot, obviously). The <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7r5wq2gDpEM"">eyecatches</a> (I forget for which season) also have audio of Yui saying ""K-On"". I suppose they must have changed the eyecatches to something else for the English dub.</p>
"
"<p>The <em>K-On!!</em> anime features a large number of songs performed by Houkago Tea Time. In addition to staples like ""Gohan wa Okazu""  and ""Fuwa Fuwa Time"", there are a number of other ones that I don't believe ever got playtime in the anime, like ""Watashi no Koi wa Hotchkiss"", to say nothing of the OP/ED themes and their B-sides, plus a ton of character songs (and not just for the main five, but also for Ui, Jun, and Nodoka). </p>

<p>Now, I haven't read the manga, but it's clearly inconceivable that all these dozens of songs could have been described in any substantial way in a mere four volumes of manga. In fact, I have to wonder if any of these songs were even noted as existing in the manga.</p>

<p>Do any of the songs in the anime originate in any way from the manga (even if only by virtue of a shared title or a lyrical excerpt)? If so, which ones?</p>

<p>(Ignore ""Tsubasa wo Kudasai"", which is <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsubasa_wo_Kudasai"">a cover of a very old song</a>.)</p>
"
"<p>This is all based on memory as I don't have the manga volumes to hand at the moment, but several of the songs were mentioned by title in the manga, and a few of them had lyrics shown that were used in the anime versions.</p>

<p>""Fuwa Fuwa Time"" was in the manga, and we even see its lyrics in one scene when Mio hands her draft of the song to the others for feedback. If I remember correctly, ""Watashi no Koi wa Hotchkiss"" and ""Fudepen Ballpen"" are mentioned on the set list before one of the concerts. I believe that ""Curry Nochi Rice"" was also mentioned late in the manga, and I'm fairly sure the storyline where Yui first writes ""Gohan wa Okazu"", then writes ""U&amp;I"" for Ui after Ui falls ill happened in the manga the same way it happened in the anime. I believe we did also see the lyrics for ""U&amp;I"" when Ui finds Yui asleep at her desk after working on the song all night and looks over what Yui wrote.</p>

<p>The opening and ending themes were never mentioned or hinted at in the manga, and several of the other songs--e.g. ""Pure Pure Heart"", ""Tenshi ni Nareta yo!""--were associated with anime-only plots. But a surprising number of the songs in the anime were actually mentioned by title in the manga.</p>

<hr>

<p>Edit: I bought the digital editions and hunted down photographic evidence of my earlier claims.</p>

<p>In Volume 1, we see Ritsu and Sawako react with horror as they read Mio's draft of ""Fuwa Fuwa Time"".</p>

<p><a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/WUlRr.jpg"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/WUlRr.jpg"" alt=""fuwa fuwa time""></a></p>

<p>In the background of the third and fourth panels on the left, we can see the first few stanzas of the song translated into English.</p>

<p>In Volume 2, Mio hands Ritsu a set list with four songs on it: ""Fuwa Fuwa Time"", ""Curry Nochi Rice"", ""Watashi no Koi wa Hotchkiss"", and ""Fudepen Ballpen"":</p>

<p><a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/X4NMHl.png"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/X4NMHl.png"" alt=""set list vol 2""></a></p>

<p>And in Volume 4, we see Yui write ""Gohan wa Okazu"":</p>

<p><a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/Xhqe1l.png"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/Xhqe1l.png"" alt=""gohan wa okazu""></a></p>

<p>Then later ""U&amp;I"":</p>

<p><a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/oGTApl.jpg"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/oGTApl.jpg"" alt=""u&amp;i""></a></p>

<p>In Volume 4, we also get a few lines from a song that Mio was working on, which provokes the usual revulsion in Ritsu and Azusa:</p>

<p><a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/vjf31l.png"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/vjf31l.png"" alt=""unknown song""></a></p>

<p>At the end of the chapter, Ritsu declares that they'll develop a song around these lyrics in addition to ""U&amp;I"" to spare Mio's feelings. However, I don't think there was any song in the anime based around these lyrics.</p>
"
"<p>Of all the songs released, <em>Fuwa Fuwa Time</em>, <em>Gohan was Okazu</em> and <em>U&amp;I</em> are the only pieces that appeared in the manga.  This can be verified by noticing that they are only songs whose lyrics are officially attributed to the original author.   You can look at the Note 28 of <a href=""https://ja.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=%E3%81%91%E3%81%84%E3%81%8A%E3%82%93!&amp;oldid=57176494#.E6.8C.BF.E5.85.A5.E6.AD.8C"" rel=""nofollow"">the relevant article in the Japanese Wikipedia</a> to see this.  Note that even for these songs, only some part of the songs appeared in the books; they were significantly augmented by a professional lyricist.</p>

"<p>In the first episode in Ouran High School Host Club, Haruhi is introduced with very drab clothing and hair.

But this doesn't explain why she dresses badly. I understand how she needs to cross-dress to pay back her debt, but did she actually cross-dress to begin with?</p>
"
"<p>In the series the ""Forest of Decay"" grows above the petrified remains of ancient trees. Dialogue from the anime and manga suggest that the toxins from the immense pollution humanity caused in the past are absorbed by the plants while water and sand are filtered through the remains of the petrified wood and become purified, which is why the wells that people made have clean soil and water. </p>

<p>The petrified trees seems to be in part inspired by the natural process of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petrified_wood"">petrified wood</a>, a special type of fossilization. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>Source <a href=""http://ouran.wikia.com/wiki/Haruhi_Fujioka#Appearance"" rel=""nofollow"">Haruhi Fujioka - Apperance (1st Paragraph)</a></p>

<p>The glasses are because she does have bad eyesight and wears contacts throughout the series (as we see when Renge is making a film and Takami sees Haruhi shed a tear without needing eyedrops).</p>

<p>As for the reason why she ""cross-dresses"" before becoming a Host it's because she doesn't see it as cross-dressing because to her gender doesn't matter.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Two characteristics that define Haruhi is her straightforward nature and <strong>belief that one's gender doesn't define one's choices</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Source <a href=""http://ouran.wikia.com/wiki/Haruhi_Fujioka#Personality"" rel=""nofollow"">Haruhi Fujioka - Personality (First Paragraph)</a></p>

<p>This is also apparent when the Host Club go to the beach (a real one, not an Otori rehab clinic) and Haruhi stands up against a couple of guys who are harassing the girls. Haruhi doesn't see that her being a girl means anything different so with that mind set there is no male/female clothing, just clothing.</p>

<p>Of course one can also assume her transvestite father may have also left a bad impression of how girls/women really are.</p>
"
"<p>From the <a href=""http://ouran.wikia.com/wiki/Haruhi_Fujioka"" rel=""nofollow"">wikia</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When first introduced in the anime, she sports a nerdy, boyish look that differs greatly from her middle-school appearance. Having gotten gum in her hair just before school begins, she cuts it short and being unable to afford the expensive Ouran uniform, she wears shapeless, baggy clothing. With her messily-styled hairdo, large glasses (which once belonged to her grandfather) and masculine clothing, she's thought to be male and Haruhi does nothing to discredit this idea.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Technically, Haruhi didn't cross dress. She wore ""shapeless, baggy clothing"", which were mistaken to be masculine because of her overall appearance. She does nothing to discredit this, thus being mistaken for a male.</p>

<p>The first part is how everyone mistakes her as a male at the start. However, Haruhi doesn't really think gender matters that much, thus has no qualms about her new uniform, or perpetuating this mistaken view.</p>

"<p>A major difference between Inuyasha and several others when it comes to the jewel shard's effects is that Inuyasha is heavily influenced by his human side, having been raised by his mother until her death and without a full blooded relative around to teach him control of his demon side. I've noticed that half demons in the show can lean towards either being more like their human side or demon side. Jinenji and Inuyasha would lead towards their human sides with their love for their human mothers whom raised them.</p>

<p>Naraku on the other hand chose his demon side through and through which is only displayed so surely whenever we see him try to suppress or throw away Onigumo's human feelings for Kikyo. As such, his becoming full demon in power has little effect on his mind because he's already using that side's state of mind to begin with.</p>

<p>Because Inuyasha's demon blood was never trained properly and said blood is so potent to begin with, his more baser instincts are what come out when it over powers his human side. (This potency and his expected death is actually why Inuyasha's father had Tetsaiga passed on to Inuyasha because he knew the results that would come if his demon blood overpowered his human blood in life or death situations) Demons are much more blood thirsty than humans, paticularly those lower class and weaker demons who have not developed a higher order of thinking which is why they are often referred to a little more than ""savage beasts"". Sesshomaru has had centuries training and controlling and evolving those instincts and power with the supposed assistance and overview of both parents. </p>

<p>Koga too is very in tune with his wolf-ish animal instincts before he even gains his shards, and everyone else who does not seem to have major effects mentally seem to already know their place in the world and do not have questions on where they stand like Inuyasha who is constantly torn from his years of shunning in both races to wanting the jewel at all just so he can fit in to one category.</p>

<p>Now Kagome and the crew have thrown him for a huge loop with their ease in accepting every part of who he is now, which completely throws off everything he's learned about his kind in the eyes of just about everyone else in Feudal Japan. (And that's about 150 years of being rejected by everyone but his mom and Kikyo)</p>

"<p>We know that Obito's Kamui, Tobirama/Minato's Flying Thundergod are SpaceTime jutsus. They are using the fourth dimension to go to any/marked places at will. As per physics &amp; Theory of relativity, if you have mastered the fourth dimension you can do both Space AND Time travel. Why can't they do time travel when they can do space travel ?</p>
"
"<p>To time travel, one needs to be <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_travel#Via_faster-than-light_.28FTL.29_travel"" rel=""nofollow"">faster than light</a>. While those ninjas use Time-Space Jutsu, none of them are faster than light.</p>

<p><strong>Obito</strong></p>

<p>Of the three, Obito is the slowest as his space-time jutsu (kamui) has some delay, proven by Kakashi's successfully landing attack on him before he managed to disappear.</p>

<p><strong>Senju Tobirama &amp; Namikaze Minato</strong></p>

<p>Both are very fast. Minato can even teleport to one of his marked kunai. I'm not sure if Tobirama can also do that, I don't remember. But the point is, although they are incredibly fast, they are not faster than light. We can safely say this, because if they are faster than light, then Minato wouldn't have his arm ripped by Madara and Tobirama won't be pinned on the ground. They would have been able to avoid Madara's attacks if they are faster than light. Thus, they cannot time travel.</p>

"<p>The black coloring induced by Haki was only introduced after the timeskip. Before that, when Haki is used, it is not visible with two exceptions: Garp's punch at Enies Lobby and Whitebeard's fist at Marineford. </p>

<p>For example, in chapter 512, Rayleigh faces Kizaru in a sword duel. Rayleigh is using a simple sword while the admiral is wielding an energy sword made of pure light. In this fight, for Rayleigh's sword to be effective against Kizaru, he is obviously using Haki, even if the Haki is not visible at all. This is confirmed by the fact that Rayleigh's sword swing injures Kizaru, a logia user. </p>

<p>Therefore, Shanks' sword is not ""made"" of anything special (i.e. seastone), he was simply embedding it with Haki. He may be wielding one of the world's great swords but this has yet to be confirmed.</p>

"<p>In <em>Mirai-hen</em>, Akihito contemplates the matter (around 7 minutes into the movie). </p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Akihito wonders whether Mirai's memory loss was the doing of the KnK. I take this to imply that Mirai being there in the first place may <em>also</em> have been the doing of the KnK.<br>
<br>
 This explanation seems consistent with what we learn about the KnK during <em>Mirai-hen</em>: that it is, in fact, some sort of ""gate"" between the world of humans and the world of youmu. That is, it seems entirely plausible that the KnK could have transported Mirai from wherever-she-was and put her back into the human world.<br>
<br>
 The motives of the KnK in doing so seem unclear to me, though (insofar as the KnK is sentient enough to <em>have</em> motives) - Mirai's lineage's sole purpose in life was to destroy the KnK, so I find it curious that it would choose to be useful Mirai in this way. </p>

"<p>I've just rewatched the Enies Lobby arc and still don't understand how Spandam became the leader of CP9. Why didn't Lucci become the leader? He's the strongest member of CP9, but why Spandam is the leader? He can't even use Rokushiki.</p>
"
"<p>While Oda doesn't specifically state how Spandam became the leader of CP9, I think that we can make some inferences</p>

<ul>
<li><p>the Wikia stated that Spandam ""relies on his natural talents of knowledge and deception, as opposed to actual combat.""</p></li>
<li><p>he also is an ardent believer in ""absolute justice,"" the form of justification that the World Government uses, and the Government itself.  We have seen the coruptness of the One Piece world government, so it isn't unthinkable in how Spandam was able to either bribe or trick his way up there.</p></li>
<li><p>We can also see how the members of CP9 barely tolerate him, but they do, implying that we was placed there because of higher government positions.</p></li>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> He actually does  become the boss of Spandam after the time skip.  They both are now in CP0.  According to the Wikia, Lucci had tried killing Spandam after the latter called Marines upon CP9, but seems to have gotten over that disagreement.</p>

"<p>It's not necessarily the strongest person who is the leader of a military group like this one. While I'm not aware of it being stated anywhere in particular <em>why</em> Spandam is the leader of CP9. There are some facts that can help us draw a conclusion.</p>

<hr>

<p>Spandam's personality makes him the type of person that only cares about how he can get promoted. Often times, these are the people that get promoted due to the various schemes they are willing to do at other's expense.</p>

<p><a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/pNaPE.jpg""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/pNaPEm.jpg"" alt=""Spandam&#39;s promotion""></a></p>

<p>From the <a href=""http://onepiece.wikia.com/wiki/Spandam"">One Piece Wikia on Spandam</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>He is not detached from the idea of exploitation, backstabbing, or the use of loopholes to get his own way, as he has proven many times in the past.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p>While we don't know when CP9 was formed, we do know that Spandine, Spandam's father, was CP9's previous leader. His role in the organization could likely have put him in a position to recommend his son to receive this position.</p>

<hr>

<p>From <a href=""http://onepiece.wikia.com/wiki/SBS_Volume_54"">SBS Volume 54</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The majority of CP9 is made up of orphaned children who were left to the government, but I thought it would be interesting if they also had the children of CP9 members, kind of like thoroughbreds. Kumadori's mom is different.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Finally, the other members of CP9 were raised as assassins, to follow the government's orders. So it's natural to have someone above them that will watch over them.</p>

  <p>Gohan was the strongest in his mystic form back at the end of DBZ. How could Gohan have become so weak that he lost the ability to turn Super Saiyan 2 in such a short period of time? While on the other hand, Frieza was able to surpass Goku's Super Saiyan Blue transformation in only 4 months of training. That doesn't make sense.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The theory acts actually goes like this, Mystic Gohan got his powers without training (Old Ki awakened his powers). After the Kid Buu incident and Berus arrival approximately 5.5 years had passed, Mystic Gohan didn't train for 5 whole years, he didn't even use his KI for that much time. At first he got the power as a given and after that he didn't train so his power drained off in the first place. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Tagoma was even able to pierce him with a ki blast. Now he is losing left and right in every episode. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Tagoma was even able to pierce him with a ki blast, that was due to his body. He hadn't trained in a while making his body dull, your body needs to be activated with a certain amount of KI to deflect energy blasts.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Most recently Frieza in his base form was shooting ki blasts through Super Saiyan Gohan. So Frieza's base form is stronger than Super Saiyan now? How did that happen?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Frieza had said that he was born so much powerful so he didn't need to train. Well Goku was weak as compared to Frieza from the very begenning so it could be that training had different results on both of them, may be frieza had this as a natural talent that's why he surpassed Majin-Buu and Mystic Gohan in his base form. </p>

"<p>the intro/outros are different.
 otherwise, <em>(I just watched all of the 1999v, and started w/the 2011, and could barely tell the difference...except)</em>
 the 2011 in/out theme is a bit obnoxious, while I'm partial to the 1999 version.</p>

<p>imo the 1999 ending song (with the female voice) is the best.
otherwise, I've watched all of the 1999v, and up to ep11 on the 2011v... with the verdict of the 2011v is a quicker story, and one youtube version (1-5 combined into one video) completely skips the first episode entirely. </p>

<p>one of my favorite parts was in the 1999v ep1, when Gon meets the fox-bear, and Kite, and this is a very touching part of the story that is left out of the 2011v. This sub-story also comes into play later on, and should be considered important..so, if you only watch the 2011v, then I recommend to (also, at least) watch the 1999v ep.1 as well to get a few extra bits of the story.</p>

  <p>Madara could have used Izanagi,he still had the Sharingan, as I know he can switch.</p>

<p>Having the Sharingan alone isn't enough, you need to activate the Izanagi before hand to perform this jutsu, if you recall from Sasuke against Danzo, Danzo had to activate the jutsu each time he had to use a new eye. That means the jutsu needs to be activated before hand. As an example when Madara was fighting Hashirama even then he activated Izanagi at first when Hashirama was about to kill him.</p>

"<p>From the manga/anime, we do not know how Brooke learned which devil fruit he had eaten, but we can safely speculate on different possible scenarios.</p>

<p>As the answer in the possible <a href=""http://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/5919/how-is-the-ability-of-a-devil-fruit-discovered"">duplicate</a> says, there is a ""Devil Fruit Encyclopedia"" which lists the names and abilities of the known devil fruits (the encyclopedia is not complete). Some devil fruits come with illustrations. This is how Blackbeard was able to identify the Yami Yami no Mi fruit and steal it from his nakama Thatch. </p>

<p>It is possible that the entry for Brook's  Yomi Yomi no Mi fruit was illustrated and therefore he knew what the fruit was before he ate it. However, note that this fruit is rather peculiar in that it does not grant any abilities while the user is still alive. Even though this is speculation, this may be the <strong>ONLY</strong> fruit with that characteristic. Therefore, even if there were no illustrations, one could have identified his fruit by the ability it came with, or lack thereof. </p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> (After Kaine's comment)</p>

<p>In chapter 676, when the salamender Slime dies and turns into gas, the powers of the artificial devil fruit he had eaten are re-introduced in a nearby apple. That means that if a devil fruit user dies near another fruit, and that fruit changes shape, one can know which type of devil fruit it is based on the deceased user's powers.</p>

"<p>Saw this manga one year ago, but I think it's not new, because when I starting reading it had already 70ish chapters, more or a bit less</p>

<p>Let's state what I remember:</p>

<ul>
<li>In the beginning there's some chapters on a ship that is transporting the people (with superpowers) to another city, where they will fight (I don't remember if there's a prize to the winner or how the winner is chosen, by killing or such things)</li>
<li>One of them demonstrated his power, disassemble (or alike), and did that to a clock that he had with him (or someone gave it to him); His power did something similar to <a href=""http://smg.photobucket.com/user/sergiolorenzon/media/heb13.jpg.html"" rel=""nofollow"">this</a></li>
<li>There's a girl that can pass through wall, but to do so, she needs to get naked</li>
<li>And then, there's one guy I believe is the protagonist, his power is something like the protagonist from Charlotte (receive the powers of the person he possessed), but he doesn't need to possess the others, just touch them; If I'm not mistaken, some of the people on the ship are afraid of him</li>
<li>There's a guy who can store almost anything in his pocket or his hair, because he stores things in another dimension</li>
<li>There's some type of organization that wear an Owl head, or it's actually their head</li>
<li>I remember another chapter where people get stuck in the walls of a building, action made by one of the ""evil people with superpower"" (I don't remember if it was a bad or a good character)</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm not sure if the next things I'll state is about the manga I was talking above, I could be mixing with another manga</p>

<ul>
<li>There's a doctor in this city, though much hate him, the people (with superpowers) need him, because he's the only one who give them treatment to the wounds of the battles</li>
<li>That doctor has a zombie assistant, a child</li>

When you use raikari it speeds your movement due to the Lighting Chakra and if you don't have sharingan to go with you(for seeing your opponents attacks from a longer range) or a lightining shield(like the raikage's have) you are in for open attacks.

"<p>Maou has been around for over 3 hundred years and has been taught more magic then even alciel knows. Emi has half human blood in her, so even though she can fly, heal, knock out someone, and use a sacred sword, she could not win in a fight against the demon king. The only reason she was able to corner him was because she had her comrades with her.</p>
"
"<p>To add to that answer, Vegeta was also in a ""good mood"" at this point as in his mind he now had all of the dragon balls. So the idea of Gohan coming after him later on wasn't really an issue since he figured he be an immortal soon. As far as Vegeta wanting Gohan to become stronger, that could be the case. Throughout the series, mostly after Gohan has grown up, Vegeta often shows visible frustration at Gohan's unwillingness to train the way he and his father do. It annoys him that Gohan has so much latent power yet he refuses to train and try to become even stronger. It's an insult to his Saiyan heritage, in his mind.</p>
"
"<p>Gohan's hidden power was talked about from almost the very first episode of Dragon Ball Z until nearly the very end. As far as he goes, his strength comes from the fact that he was thrown into fighting life and death battles when he was just 4 with the arrival of Raditz and his training under Piccolo. Just look at his resume: Raditz, the Saiyans, Frieza and all his minions, and then Cell. I stop at Cell because that was the last time he seriously trained for any sustained amount of time. But even after that, he stopped training for 7 years and his power decreased to the point where he was ""only"" a little stronger than Perfect Cell. During the Buu saga, the Old Kaioshin just unlocked the rest of his dormant power. So with all he experienced when he was a kid, it's only natural that he'd be a formidable fighter regardless of how much he's let himself go.</p>

<p>As far as Goten goes, he was being trained by Chichi. She might not be very powerful herself compared to the Z fighters, but she's certainly the strongest female in the world aside from 18. Her training methods were never really discussed but from the one flashback of her sparring with Goten, we can see that she was going pretty hard on him so it wouldn't be too far fetched to think that she'd be able to make him powerful. Like Gohan, he has the hidden power, so it's just a matter of training. The main difference is that Chichi allows Goten to train whereas Gohan had to either sneak off for that or there had to be something threatening Earth.</p>

"<p>I believe <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship_in_Japan"" rel=""nofollow"">Japan's obscenity laws</a> have some particular rules regarding pubic hair. Also, often hentai artists prefer a hairless body for their particular demographic / fetish / etc.</p>

<p>Up until the mid 1990s, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornography_in_Japan"" rel=""nofollow"">pubic hair had to be censored</a> in Japanese media. The law has been relaxed since, but as it had been common to do without hair, many artists continued with it.</p>

<p>Saying that, there are some hentai works that contain pubic hair - but whether they are complying with the law is another topic, as mangaka's regularly 'interpret' the law loosely. Such as opting for a very minimal censor bar:</p>

<p><a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/iAwVS.png"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/iAwVS.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>A female version would be similarly censored to a minimal interpretation of the law. Unfortunately I don't have any appropriate pictures of fruit on hand.</p>

"<p>I may have the phrases figured out.  Initially I was extra confused as to why there would be such out-of-context English phrases printed in a Japanese anime.  Senshin cleared that up, and I realized everyone could read the text.</p>

<p>I've now watched some of the original 1999 Hunter x Hunter anime series.  In those, the psychotic villain (and sometimes ally) Hisoka occasionally refers to Gon as ""unripe fruit"".  (I do not believe he ever says that in the 2011 version.)  The context is, even though Hisoka feels sorely tempted, it is too early to destroy Gon (and perhaps Killua) now.  He is like unripe fruit, and it will be much more enjoyable to destroy the boy mentally and physically once Gon is older and gained significant skill.</p>

<p>Knowing that everyone can read ""brush your teeth"" helped me see the image afresh.  I thought Killua was just smiling, but now I see it is a huge, clenched-teeth smile.  Plus his right hand seems to be grasping an invisible tooth brush and motioning as if demonstrating proper tooth brushing technique.  The ""Hunterpedia"" environment is being presented as a classroom.</p>

<p>The one remaining puzzle is why Gon's left hand seems to be motioning as well.</p>

"<p>From what I remember: Lelouch and Nunnally were given as hostages to Japan. Britannia invades Japan. Lelouch and Nunnally somehow live.</p>

<p><strong>Why exactly are they alive and not announced dead?</strong></p>

<p>I thought the whole point of taking or giving hostages is to ensure a certain agreement. When Britannia invaded Japan, it seems whatever agreement Britannia and Japan had was breached so why didn't Genbu or whoever execute Lelouch and Nunnally? Is it that someone tried but failed to do so?</p>

<p>Alternatively, if for some reason the relevant legitimate or de facto authorities of Japan didn't want to execute Lelouch and Nunnally (pity, morality, attempt at using them as double agents or whatever), why didn't Lelouch or someone decide to have his and Nunnally's (fake) deaths made known rather than making Clovis, Euphemia, Cornelia, et al merely presume or suspect their deaths?</p>

<p>Could be remembering the series wrong, but it seems like they guessed Lelouch and Nunnally were dead rather than, say, found out from Japanese news. If I were one of them, I would find it suspicious that the Japanese authorities didn't execute or announce that they executed them.</p>
"
"<p>After the Second Pacific War and Invasion of Japan, Lelouch and Nunnally decided to live under false identities (not to have plastic surgery and be seen in public).</p>

<p>Why? What exactly were they thinking? They really wouldn't be recognised? I seem to recall Cornelia and Kirihara recognised Lelouch.</p>
"
"<p>As a kid, Lelouch vowed to destroy Britannia or something, but how was he going to do that without the Geass or rich or powerful allies besides Suzaku and the Ashford family? It's not like the Japanese were using or planning to use him or Nunnally as double agents or anything like that, or were they?</p>

<p>Anytime pre-Geass, did he actually stand a chance of exacting his childhood revenge?</p>
"
"<p>Lelouch and Nunnally being sent to Japan as Hostages was itself another ploy. In Season 2 when Charles is explaining everything to Lelouch when they are trapped in the Sword of Akasha he revealed that he sent them away to protect them for V.V who had already murdered Marianne. </p>

<p>Also at the start of the series we see C.C watching a young Lelouch and Suzaku probably before the war so given the connection Marianne had with C.C during the series it's possible C.C (before being captured) was sent by Marianne to look out for her children.</p>

<p>Prior the start of the War Britannia haddn't fully developed their Knightmares which was one of the key pieces of technology which gave Britannia an edge</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>However, when Britannia finally developed its Knightmare Frames fleet and decided to invade Japan to seize control of the Sakuradite mines, consequently discarding Lelouch's use as a diplomatic tool</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Source: <a href=""http://codegeass.wikia.com/wiki/Lelouch_vi_Britannia#Character_Outline"" rel=""nofollow"">Lelouch vi Britannia - Character Outline (2nd Paragraph)</a></p>

<p>This means executing them would have no merit. remember also that Lelouch had forfeited his claim to the Throne and before doing this the background chatter by the Nobles talked about them being lucky if Nunnally could be married off for political gain in her condition. their value as hostages were already much lower and Japan's main bargaining chip was their Sakuradite which, now with their Knightmares, Britannia could take by force and stop the other super powers from getting it.</p>

<p>Also i would think Suzaku and Todoh would have done something to save them if someone got the idea to punish Britannia by executing them (and i suspect at the start of the series were we see Lelouch vow to destroy Britannia it was Todoh who we see at the fire).</p>

<p>As for making Lelouch's and Nunnally's deaths known to be false this would probably just insult Britannia. the first thing that would be done if this happened was to denounce Japan's claims and because most Britannians look down on foreigners chances are that Charles would claim that Lelouch and Nunnally were impostors withother probably voicing their disgust that the Japanese have the audacity to use foreign commoners to pose as members of the Imperial Family.</p>

<p>Lets not forget that the heirs to the throne were fighting one another, while there are some would would want to protect Lelouch and Nunnally there are others who would use the war as a cover to kill them permanently removing them from the line of succession. weather the Japanese knew is or not doesn't matter as Lelouch would be opposed to it because it would be putting Nunnally in greater danger.</p>

<p>They are always seen when in an action sequence. Why do mangakas draw these kinds of lines and what do they mean?</p>
"
"<p>The top drawing shows when a character is moving fast (such as running or hitting something with power) The lines show the direction the movement is happening. The lower drawing shows that this is a very important piece of information or that the character is at an intense state of emotion: such as if the character finds out that his/her friend is a mass murderer.</p>
"
"<p>During the beginning of the series when he was on his way to class and he ended up fighting in the garage is the ""start"" of the ability to get revenge. If he couldn't get revenge there would be no show, so he gains power more and more as the series progresses onward. The entire plot was based around his revenge so that was also more of a backstory explaining why he hated Britannia thus setting way for his awesome revenge and brilliant use of people's emotions to make the people of Britannia realize they should work together and stop hating their political leaders. </p>

"<p>The term you're looking for is (generically) ""speed lines"". Unsurprisingly, they are typically as a visual indicator that something is speedy. </p>

<p>The terminology is a little silly, though - the horizontal, fixed-width lines in your first image are clearly used for different purposes from the vanishing-point-oriented, variable-width lines in your second image, and bucketing them all as ""speed lines"" is a bit inaccurate.</p>

<p>As it turns out, Japanese has better terminology for these lines. There is a broader term <a href=""https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%8A%B9%E6%9E%9C%E7%B7%9A"">効果線</a> ""effect lines"" that subsumes both スピード線 ""speed lines"" (your first image) and 集中線 ""focus lines"" (your second image), as well as some other rarer styles of line. This is a more appropriate choice of words, in my opinion: the ""focus lines"", unlike the lines in your first image, are used to draw focus to whatever is ""at"" the vanishing point of the lines. </p>

<p>(This visual language seems fairly intuitive and universal to me, so I'm a little surprised that you had this question - not that there's anything wrong with that.)</p>

"
"<p>The left drawing looks like it is showing something happening at speed, for example if you were to put a character there in front of those horizontal lines, you'd get the impression that that character is moving at speed, e.g. like running.</p>

<p>The one on the right has the effect of focusing the reader on a particular aspect of that drawing square, and it's use can hugely vary. It can also be used to reveal something surprising by putting an object/character between those exiting lines.</p>

"<p><strong>Theory 1</strong>: As <a href=""http://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/28281/why-does-moral-shoot-through-a-pillow#comment39583_28281"">senshin mentioned</a> this is likely meant as a silencer, or suppressor, for the gun.</p>

<p>It seems to be a pretty popular belief that shooting through a pillow would dampen the sound of the gun. I can't find any reliable information on this unfortunately, only some videos that show <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NJ-0MePb4g"">some</a> <a href=""https://youtu.be/cnMeTlXsXC8?t=75"">effect</a>. However, the decibel values from the first video are roughly in line with what <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suppressor#Effectiveness"">Wikipedia says</a> is a typical dampening achieved by a real suppressor, i.e. around 130dB which is still very loud. In the end the sound levels also depend on many other things such as sub- or supersonic bullets or the firing mechanism as discussed <a href=""http://www.intuitor.com/moviephysics/mpmain.html#Sound"">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Theory 2</strong>: A pillow could be used to contain splatter, in particular keep it off the shooter's clothes.</p>

<p>The latter doesn't really fit the distance between target and pillow in the image and since you say the sound effect is muffled in the anime, Theory 1 seems to be what they were going for.</p>

"<p>There is no real answer since it doesnt exist!
But based on what happened in the story, Lelouch visited a ""underground"" type club? to play chess, so there is a possibility that he he already had connections in the underground world.
Also by Anime logic the fact that he was so smart, the main character would find a way..</p>

<p>This is more of a discussion of opinions than a direct question..!</p>
"
"<p>When Lelouch made his vow to Suzaku to destroy Britannia this was more of a child venting his frustration at how powerless he was as he was seeing a close friend's homeland be ravaged by the same ideals he thought claimed his mother's life and crippled his sister.</p>

<p>When Lelouch got Geass in his monologue he points out how he was living as a zombie just going though the motions of living but not really living. so between when he made his vow and when he got Geass Lelouch appeared to accept reality that all he could do was look after Nunnally, at least until an opportunity came which would allow him to fight back (which Geass was)</p>

<p>Also i should point out that there was no way the Ashford Family could help him even if he did do something as a child. after Marianne's death the Ashford Family, who were her supports, lost alot of standing.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>She is aware of Lelouch's identity as a former prince of Britannia, since her family were close supporters of his mother, Empress Marianne. This relationship however, would lead to the family's nobility status being stripped.</p>
  
  <p>The Ashfords, wanting to restore their former glory, have two options in doing so; either reinstate Lelouch and Nunnally back into the royal family, or to arrange a marriage with a noble. Since the former would get both of them killed, the Ashfords opted for the latter, and arrange several marriage interviews for Milly, with Earl Lloyd Asplund eventually winning out; </p>

<p>The only other thing he could try and do is unify the Resistance Factions but as we could see when he first tried commanding them they weren't fully trusting at first and when things went wrong the second time the group he was commanding abandoned him. really the only reason he gained so much support and fame with the resistance factions was because of his miracles brought on by his Geass</p>

<p>So unless C.C contacted Lelouch much much earlier there was really no way he could put up any sort plan to undermine and destroy Britannia</p>

"<p>During episode 11 of Tokyo Ravens, there was a scene on a weekend that Dairenji Suzuka visited Tsuchimikado Harutora's room and explored its inside just to annoy Harutora.</p>

<p>Then after that, Suzuka also asked to enter Tsuchimakado Natsume's room. However, Natsume deliberately refused Suzuka's demand even though that they know that Suzuka can black mail Natsume about revealing her great secret.</p>

<p>And after that, Natsume was forcibly tied by Suzuka in order for them to visit Her room. The inside of the room was pretty normal, so they wondered why would Natsume be that worried, but as Suzuka monitored the room, she noticed a very complicated barrier that is protecting Natsume's closet. Curiously, Suzuka tried to forcibly open the closet by removing the barrier. Then Natsume desperately crawled going to her room with tears in her face showing her great fear of Suzuka opening the closet and them knowing the contents inside.</p>

<p>(Just look at her annoyingly cute expression as she crawled! XD)

<p>Since Harutora was kind enough to feel pity on Natsume, He ordered Kon to release Natsume from her binding.</p>

<p>As soon as Natsume's binding was released, she desperately called Hokuto (Overpowered) just to protect her secret; Thus destroying her room due to Hokuto's size.</p>

<p>Now, this is my question:</p>

<ol>
<li>Why was Natsume desperate of not letting them (Suzuka, Harutora, Touji) enter her room, even though its pretty normal? (if there is no exact reason, maybe a girl's perspective will do)</li>
<li>What is inside Natsume's closet? Is it so very important that she even protected it with strong barriers and even called Hokuto just to protect it? (there is also a <a href=""http://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/21200/what-was-natsume-hiding-in-her-closet-in-episode-11"">question related to this</a> but the answers did not fill the void in my heart.</li>
</ol>
"
"<p>There are several reasons why no one noticed that Natsume was a girl:</p>

<ol>
<li>She was dressing as a boy, therefore no one should suspect her.</li>
<li>On the novel, an onmyouji can identify whether you're a girl or boy based on your aura. Boys naturally have yang aura and girls have yin aura. <br><br>
Normally, when a practitioner has a shikigami, the shikigami's aura should be the opposite so that their compatibility will be in harmony.<br><br>
However, Natsume's prideful shikigami which is Hokuto have a yin aura, therefore it made conflict in their auras, thus negating the yin aura and making it a yang aura. In result, anyone would assume that Natsume was indeed a boy.</li>
<li>It is rumored that Natsume was Yakou's reincarnation, since she was the next heir of the Tsuchimikado family, they preconceived that she is a boy.</li>

"<p>From my experience with Arakawa Under the Bridge (and it's been quite a bit of time), the two brothers (along with a number of other characters at Rec's welcoming party) don't get a proper introduction until later on in the first or second seasons.</p>

<p>I would say it was Shaft making an animation mistake, since the two of them weren't characters they were focusing on yet, so they could draw them without as much attention to detail/quality.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was something with the manga though; whether the author hadn't made a final decision on their appearances until later on, she just drew them like that for the time being. Shaft, for whatever reason, could've replicated this. (Part of me finds that unlikely because they would've received the characters' heights and such from the manga publishers by the time they started the anime, but part of me think it may be possible because it's Shaft lol.)</p>

<p>I could look through the manga and see what I could find, but right now, I'd say it was Shaft just making a mistake.</p>

"<p>WARNING: THIS ANSWER CONTAINS SPOILERS UP TO EPISODE 23</p>

<p>The amount of time that's passed in Dragon Ball Super is apparently open to interpretation. In BoG, Gohan was probably still the strongest or at least on the same level as Goku before he goes SSJG, hence the reason why they made it a point to have him step in as if he was the only one who could stop Beerus. Obviously, that didn't work out too well for him. But he powered up into his ""mystic"" form and that's the last time we see it, so far. </p>

<p>I don't see how he could have fallen so far behind Goku and Vegeta prior to their being trained by Whis, but basically Gohan hasn't trained, like at all. Not like the time between when he fought Cell and Majin Buu where he just slacks on his training—this time he really did nothing at all. The most ""training"" you see him do is when he's play fighting with Mr. Satan as Great Saiyaman over baby Pan. </p>

<p>They do make it a point to show that he hasn't necessarily lost his power, as he's able to easily beat Ginyu (in Tagoma's body) as a Super Saiyan, just the ability to access all of it at will without seriously injuring or killing himself has been lost. Against Frieza, he may have been able to fight with him and at least hold him off till Goku and Vegeta got there, but we all saw what bringing out more power than his body can handle did to him. Think Kaioken and what happened to Goku when he fought Vegeta, except on a much larger scale. </p>

<p>They also made it a point to show that maybe he wasn't necessarily ""too weak"" to face Frieza, just too soft. He lets his guard down while showing mercy to Ginyu in the same way Goku did with Frieza and pays for it with a ki blast through the shoulder. Given that he was clearly angry with himself for letting his training go, which made him unable to protect his family, maybe he's learned his lesson about just assuming his dad or Vegeta will always be there to protect everyone and will find some motivation to train a little bit. We'll see. My point is that they seem to be putting raw power into a grey area and focusing more on ability, experience and fighting spirit in this series. That's just my opinion based on the fact that Roshi was there fighting when Yamcha is easily at least still stronger than he is. Anyway, I hope that helps anyone wondering what's happening with Gohan. He's not weak, power-wise, he's just out of shape and rocking the dad bod.</p>

<p>Sasuke Uchiha, was developing into the prodigy that his elder brother Itachi was. Orochimaru had experienced Itachi's power first hand. And it proved too great for him. </p>

<p>Another reason, was the Uchiha clan's famed Sharingan. Itachi's prowess with his Sharingan was outstanding. Orochimaru expected the same from Sasuke.</p>

<p>Since Orochimaru couldn't take control of Itachi's body, he decided to settle for his younger brother's. </p>

<p>As to why Naruto wasn't chosen, Orochimaru favoured Sasuke over Naruto. Because at that time, Naruto was at the back of the class, and Sasuke was the Uchiha prodigy. Also, the fact that Sasuke is Sharingan abled and Itachi's brother, outweighed Naruto's overall. </p>

<p>The two reasons as to why Orochimaru used the Five Elements Seal:</p>

<ul>
<li>He wanted to disallow Naruto from using the Kyubi's chakra.</li>
<li>And to tamper his control over his own chakra.</li>
</ul>

"<p>No, the transformation sequence hasn't been censored. The visuals in the original are the same.</p>

<p>Sailor Moon is Shoujo, so it would have been originally intended for teen and preteen girls.</p>
"
"<p>In general, Sailor Moon was heavily edited for the US release as detailed by fans for example <a href=""http://www.smuncensored.com/season.php?season=1"">here</a>. In particular nudity was avoided as exemplified below.</p>

<p><sup>The source of these images is <a href=""http://www.movie-censorship.com/report.php?ID=1489254"">this</a> comparison between the US and the German version. While the German version is not completely uncensored (see the linked site for details) it is almost equal to the Japanese original and does not have censorship of nudity.</sup></p>

<p>Regarding the <strong>transformation scenes</strong> in particular: Many sites claim the US censorship manifested itself in removal of the breast outlines, however all examples I find on youtube look the same to me. The two sites mentioned above also say that the only change is a speed-up of the transformation - likely to fit the overall episode runtime due to other edits.</p>

<p>Other changes include the removal of violence in particular against children and gender changes as not to display homosexuality. This all pertains to the original US release, while subsequent ones <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sailor_Moon_%28anime%29#Localization"">apparently</a> stayed more true to the Japanese original.</p>

<p>To address the second question, as <a href=""http://anime.stackexchange.com/a/28304/34"">Skullclutter already mentioned</a> Sailor Moon is considered a <em>shōjo</em> series and therefore aimed at young women.</p>

"<p>The question itself is self-explanatory!

"<p>First, I was going to ask where the Arbiters originated from? Like where were they chosen from? But then after watching the animé, I learned the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Arbiters' 2nd Law : Arbiters have no emotions since they are dummies!</li>
<li>Decim's statement to Chiyuki : If humans stay here for too long, they’ll turn into dummies!</li>
</ol>

<p>These two things make me think that the Arbiters might be previously humans turned to dummies and then to Arbiters! Is it possible? Is that true? And if not then what about the origin of the Arbiters? How are they made or chosen?</p>

<p>As far as I remember the story is never set in Italy, however the Mafia-like organizations featured in the Anime are likely what makes the connection here and you will probably agree that there is quite a bit of ""ruckus"" going on,</p>
"
"<p>As per the <a href=""http://death-parade.wikia.com/wiki/Arbiters"">Wikia article on Arbiters</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Their existence remains a mystery. Nona has stated that they are not human, do not experience emotions like humans do, and have never lived or died. They are even made to look like humans but are created for the specific purpose of judging humans.</strong> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This makes it evident that the Arbiters were never humans and shall never be.</p>

<hr>

<p>The only exception to the ""feeling emotion"" bit is <a href=""http://death-parade.wikia.com/wiki/Decim"">Decim</a>.</p>

<p><a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/JsLPW.png""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/JsLPW.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<pre><code>                        Decim expressing human emotion
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>However, Decim appears to be an exception as Nona has implanted human emotions in him which, though at the beginning did not yet seem to appear or were not yet tapped, appear to be surfacing with him as Chiyuki criticizes him for drawing the darkness of human hearts and passing judgement, stating that it is not right for them to be doing that since humans are more simple than the arbiters think. </p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p>Simply put, the origin of the Arbiters is unknown. Since they're said to be ""created"", we  can only assume that some methods/technology is used for creating them, or maybe <a href=""http://death-parade.wikia.com/wiki/Oculus"">Oculus</a> has some power to create them:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Oculus is the creator of the system of arbitration. He observes all floors and is in a higher position than Nona. He is the second in line to the position of God.</strong></p>

<p>Note: This is only speculation on my part. There's no mention of it in Death Parade or Death Billiards (Movie), so we can never truly know where they originate from.</p>

"<p>The anime starts off with the guy in a hotel room, he turned on the TV and got a knock at the door. It turned out to be a girl that at the moment he didn't know but I think she turned out to be his cousin? They almost had sex because she seduced him and he thought she was a random call girl but he realized at the last second who she was I think and he kicked her out wearing no clothes lol.</p>

<p>Then, he started taking a bunch of college entrance exams failing all of them I think... he ran into some beautiful woman who I think went to the Tokyo U, or some kind of prestigious University that he couldn't hope to get into. But he went and took the exam anyway and that's about all I remember.</p>

<p>However, I encountered a few more terminologies concerning anime and mangas referring to masculine homosexuality :</p>

<ul>
<li>Shōnen'ai</li>
<li>JUNE</li>
<li>Yaoi</li>
<li>Boys' love</li>

<p>What are the main differences between those genres?</p>
"
"<p>As mentioned in <a href=""http://anime.stackexchange.com/a/14374/15542"">this answer</a>, the terms <em>seme</em> and <em>uke</em> are used in yaoi to describe a duality:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Yaoi fans have adapted these terms to describe the roles in a male/male relationship: the seme is the one who takes the traditional male role: initiates the relationship, ""pursues"" the uke and is usually ""on top"" during sex. This can get ridiculously codified and outright heteronormative, e.g. the seme has to be taller and stronger, not show their emotions, etc. The ""uke ends up winning"" aspect may or may not be relevant.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If there is an equivalent to this kind of relationship in yuri manga and animation, what is it called?</p>
"
"<p>In the author's notes in the last chapter (113) of The Gamer, he is talking about a webtoon that is apparently very similar, and I assume a lot of people have asked them if hey got anything to do with it, which they deny.</p>

<p>Can anyone tell me what webtoon they mean?</p>
"
"<p>On <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seme"">Wikipedia for Seme</a> one of the dot points do say</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Seme, a manga/anime term for a dominant partner in a homosexual relationship</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and following the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yaoi#Seme_and_uke"">Seme link</a> in the first paragraph it says</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The two participants in a yaoi relationship (<strong>and to a lesser extent in yuri</strong>) are often referred to as seme (""top"") and uke (""bottom""). </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now given that the first page only says homosexsual and according to <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexuality"">Wikipedia</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Homosexuality (from Ancient Greek ὁμός, meaning ""same"", and Latin sexus, meaning ""sex"") is romantic attraction, sexual attraction or sexual behavior between members of the same sex or gender.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and that Shoujo Ai/Yuri involves lesbian relationships which are romantic attraction, sexual attraction or sexual behavior between 2 females the terms probably are the same in Shoujo Ai/Yuri</p>

<p>Funny enough if we look at the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuri"">Yuri Page on Wikipedia</a> it's a disambiguation page unlike the Yaoi Page i linked to and the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuri_(genre)"">Yuri Genre</a> pages is no where near as fleshed out as the Yaoi page (and there is no Yaoi (Genre) page either). Given that <em>seme</em> and <em>uke</em> are fan terms one might assume that Yaoi fans wanted clear terms to decried who is the dominate partner in the relationship that Yuri fans do not have much need for (because in my view in Shoujo Ai/Yuri there is no set dominate partner rather that role can switch very easily between the members of the relationship)</p>

"<p><strong>Shounen-Ai</strong> 
Literally translated means boys love. However, in these type of series, it usually represents an innocent, non sexual nature of homosexuality.
Ex- 7-Ghosts.</p>

<p>(Taken from wikipedia)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The term shōnen-ai (boy love) originally connoted ephebophilia or pederasty in Japan, but from the early 1970s to the late 1980s, was used to describe a new genre of shōjo manga, primarily produced by the Year 24 Group of women authors, about beautiful boys in love. Characteristics of shōnen-ai include exoticism, often taking place in Europe, and idealism. Jeffrey Angles particularly notes Moto Hagio's The Heart of Thomas (1974) and Keiko Takemiya's Kaze to Ki no Uta (1976-1984) as being groundbreaking, noting their portrayal of intense friendship between males, including jealousy and desire.</p>

Read chapter 436, 464 and 465. In chapter 436, when Zeref thinks about his past, how he created all other demons to kill him, but all of them failed. He then says, ""And so, finally I made you. I made you.... With the hope that you'd truly be as your name States, END. And if you read further down that chapter, he also says that the body Natsu was given is not his own body, but the body of Zeref's deceased brother. In chapter 464 and 465, When Natsu faces Zeref once again face to face. Zeref tells Natsu the truth behind the END, and also Zeref left Natsu with Igneel(a friend of Zeref): as Igneel didn't have ill feelings towards humans. So yeah, I think this helped you.

"<p>Just give you some info about the <a href=""http://dragonball.wikia.com/wiki/Potara"" rel=""nofollow"">Potara earrings</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
  <li><em>Potara Fusion</em> is similar to the <em>Fusion Dance technique</em>, however unlike the Fusion Dance, the Potara Fusion is <strong>permanent</strong>.</li>
  <li>To use the Potara fusion, the two fusees each take one of the two earrings and put them on opposing ears. The two will automatically merge as soon as the earrings are put on.</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>After the fusion is done, the fused character has 2 earrings on each side of their ears, neither in the Anime nor the Manga has shown that fused character remove the Potara earrings. This makes me wonder what happens when fused character like <em>Vegito</em> remove one or two of the earrings, will they be separated? Or still permanently fused forever?</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/Nwq36.png"" width=""450""></p>

"<p>No, removing the earrings does NOT nullify the fusion.</p>

<p>Source - <a href=""http://universaldragonball.wikia.com/wiki/Potara_Earrings"" rel=""nofollow"">http://universaldragonball.wikia.com/wiki/Potara_Earrings</a></p>

<p>Quote from the wiki - </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The earrings have the ability to fuse two people into a single entity, substantially enhancing the abilities of both individuals. The resulting fusion lasts forever, even if the fused being removes the earrings. However, there is one instance where the Potara Fusion will be nullified and restore the fused being back to their original forms, which is when they are sucked into an environment that would not support it (as seen with Vegito being absorbed inside Buu).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Edit: I've found a quote of Elder Kaioshin, stating that the Potara earrings are meant to be eternal-lasting.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Context: Elder Kaioshin gives the Potara to Goku Elder Kaioshin: “Here! Put
  this Potara on your left ear! [ ] Put the other one on Gohan’s ear.
  Just by doing that, you two will be able to merge together! Like with
  Fusion.” Goku: “Huh! Re-really!?” Elder Kaioshin: “Of course. And
  what’s more, the effect is greater than with Fusion! This has been the
  trump card treasure of the Kaioshins since long ago.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>source - Chapter: 501 (DBZ 307), P6.2-6</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Context: Goku asks how long Potara-based fusion lasts
  Elder Kaioshin: ""The Potara don't have such a weakness. It's eternal! You'll never return to normal again!""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>source - Chapter: 501 (DBZ 307), P11.6</p>

<p>Edit 2 -
As jphager2 has mentioned in the comments below, after using the Potara Earrings, they can then be removed &amp; re-used to fuse 2 new people, we've never been given information about the possibility of 2 fusions being able to fuse, and the only information I can find on it is speculation.</p>

"<p>My personal theory is that it represents Mavis's search for the faeries with Zera. In one scene, Zera and Mavis are talking, and Mavis points out that Zera's hair looks like tails. To also explain another idea about the faeries, think back to when Zera ""disappeared"" and when they hugged in the pond. In the pond, it looked like we saw a little ball of light- a fairy. And when Zera disappeared, and Mavis was crying, it looked like Zera turned into a group of faeries! And when Warrod, Yuri, and Precht heard her voice, it looked like a faerie was flying past them. Sorry if this spoils. :/</p>

  <p>Shin was one of Orochimaru's experimental test subjects and followers,

  Together they performed various experiments, cultivating clones from
  Shin's teeth and nerves in order to uncover many secrets of genetics.
  At some point Shin became intrigued by the Uchiha clan, especially
  Itachi Uchiha. As such, he began to imitate the Uchiha: adopting their
  surname and customary clothing, as well as numerous Sharingan which
  have been implanted all over his body. <strong>His Sharingan-embedded right
  arm was harvested by Orochimaru and transplanted to Danzō Shimura

As of Ging I don't know but he might lie about it to. Now you have probably been thinking, ""who does he think gons bio mother is? My answer is mito-San because as far as we know there aren't any laws against underage sex in the HxH universe, so what if ging gons grandmother and mito-San are lying and ging didn't just turn up one day and ask gons grandmother and mito-San to raise gon. What if mito San and ging are the 2 bio parents of gon. * note I'm just going to say that after thinking about it I think that ging wouldn't lie to gon about that so what if togashi is just not showing us mito San telling gon that gon is his dad and that she is his bio mother.</p>

<p>We can assume then that one of these objects&mdash;presumably the brooch and/or the soul, as the other Sailor Guardians do not have the Legendary Silver Crystal&mdash;is necessary for ""maintaining"" the transformed state.

"<p>After a failed attempt at recalling the name of a childhood acquaintance, Miho helpfully guided Sakura to look at the blackboard where the teacher had the name of the transfer student written down. Sakura continued to feign remembering the guy, but then the scene panned down to reveal that Sakura kept one hand off the table while Miho remarked about Sakura being a liar.</p>

<p><a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/RtyT6.jpg"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/RtyT6.jpg"" alt=""Episode 4 at 4 minutes 41 seconds""></a></p>

<p>My questions are:</p>

<ol>
<li>How could Miho tell, for sure, that Sakura was lying? Was it the hand gesture or something she said?</li>
<li>Is this a Japanese culture thing, and what should Sakura have done if she truly remembered the guy?</li>
</ol>
"
"<p>Some anime series use captions to translate signs, text messages, speech bubbles, and the like while others do not. I'm left guessing when some characters only communicate through these messages and nothing is translated. Are these extra translations done by specific studios or on a case by case basis?</p>
"
"<p>I am not aware of any Japanese body language rooted in having one hand on the table and the other pointed down like that. In fact, Japanese gesture communication is generally conducted at chest-height or higher.</p>

<p>Miho knew that Sakura was lying because she had just finished guiding Sakura to look at the blackboard, because she had been able to tell that Sakura obviously didn't remember his name, and clearly wasn't really paying attention when he was introduced to the class. Miho had just helped provide Sakura with his name since she obviously didn't remember him, so of course she knew that Sakura was lying when she pretended to still remember him.</p>

<p>The camera pan-down was more likely intended to center the view on Miho for her delivery of the 'liar' line than it was to display hand position or body language. And the camera was lowered as far as it was to cut Sakura and the transfer student's heads out of the frame to make it very clear where your focus was supposed to be (on Miho).</p>

<p>If Sakura had actually remembered the transfer student, she wouldn't have needed Miho to point his name out on the blackboard, and thus Miho wouldn't have believed her to be lying when she claimed to remember him.</p>

<p>So, in short, Miho's ""liar"" line was delivered because she just helped Sakura with the name of someone Sakura clearly didn't remember...then Sakura used that help to pretend she had remembered him all along, pretending Miho hadn't actually helped.</p>

<p>For some people, this might be acceptable because they just helped a friend save face...but it obviously annoyed Miho.</p>

"<p>After watching Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion and Code Geass:Lelouch of the Rebellion R2, I simply couldn't understand why Lelouch allowed himself to be overthrown by the Black Knights, and even lied about what his intent was. Or why he lied to Suzaku about ordering Euphie to kill the Japanese. So I spent hours trying to come up with a theory, and I ended up with this.</p>

<p>I think that Lelouch had planned for Suzaku to kill him all along. If he had admitted that he didn't mean to make Euphie kill the Japanese, Suzaku would be unable to kill Lelouch. In order for the Zero Requiem to succeed, Lelouch had to die. And Lelouch trusted nobody more than Suzaku, even when they were enemies. After all, he frequently said that there was nothing they couldn't do together.</p>

<p>Many people have wondered if Lelouch really did use the Black Knights. I believe this is partly true and partly false. When he was confronted by the Black Knights after they heard the recorded conversation between Lelouch and Suzaku, he told them that everything he had done was for his entertainment, and that the Black Knights were just pawns to him. I think he did this to protect the Black Knights-if they believed they were worthless to him they would have no reason to rescue him now that Schneizel knew his identity. This would protect the Black Knights. This implies that he cared for them and did not use them.
However, the Black Knights were essential to his plan, as he was relying on them to create a better world once he died. So he couldn't afford for them to collapse and be defeated. This could be seen as using them.</p>

<p>So I guess Lelouch is evil, but he is fighting on the side of justice-he is willing to sacrifice his humanity for the greater good. And an evil hero is still a hero. And as Suzaku realised at last, it's the end result that matters, not the means of getting there.</p>

<p>I hope you consider and expand my theory, and I hope this answers the question.</p>

"<p>The answer is <strong>YES</strong> and <strong>NO</strong>, it all depends on which Akira Toriyama wants them to be.</p>

<p><em>Potara Fusion</em> is not just a fusion, it somewhat merge two beings into one,  sharing both memories. Unlike the <em>Fusion Dance</em>, even though they have fused into one being, but they still have both performers' conscious, that's why you hear 2 sounds overlapping when fused character is talking.</p>

<p>I saw this example on the wiki, it says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Have Goku and Vegeta fuse with Potara Earrings, then have Trunks and Goten do the same. Then, have Vegito remove one of his earring and have Trunken do the same, and they'll become Gogetenks. It's like how Supreme Kai and Kibito fused by removing their Potara Earrings. I don't think they've ever said what happens if a Potara fusion removes their earrings, so I assume it would work this way. By that logic, everyone in the DBZ universe could fuse into one ultimate being.</p>

"<p>I haven't watched all of it yet, but it seems as if Nausicaä isn't wearing underpants in the anime version. Either that, or she's wearing tight-fitting slacks that are of a colour close to skin tone. Is she wearing underpants?</p>

<p>If she isn't wearing underpants, what is the outside-universe reason for not doing so? Within-universe, it seems to make sense: a lot of the clothing worn is very simple clothing, as if it were hand-made. However, while other Ghibli works I've come across seem moderately relaxed with regards to clothing (you can briefly see totally innocent underwear in Kiki's delivery service, and there's a joking suggestion of nude portraiture) it seems a little surprising. Is a bias against prudishness a shared theme of Ghibli, along with a love of flying and a love of nature?</p>

His insatiable love for spilling the blood of powerful fighters in combat and his enjoyment of extreme pain while doing so fuels his seemingly sadomasochistic desires. In order for them to grow to their full potential (so as to improve the pleasure of killing them later), Hisoka allows the main protagonists to live in situations wherein he is easily able to kill them. Likewise, he grows excited to meet any new people he deems worthy of fighting or anyone with potential to be a good fighter and entertain him in the future. </p>

  <p>Disney’s first Studio Ghibli Blu-ray release includes the movie on DVD and is of the digitally restored version. Suffice it to say this is the best the movie has ever looked in the States. The movie is presented in anamorphic widescreen in 1.85:1 ratio for both discs while the Blu-ray is in 1080p High Definition.    </p>
  
  <p>It is absolutely gorgeous with the colors finally being faithful. This is important due to prior releases making it look like Nausicaä wasn’t wearing any pants or underwear! The color of her pants were too close to the skin tone used and got lost in the mastering before this release.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.asianblurayguide.com/capture/1707/nausicaa_of_the_valley_of_the_wind_anime_japan/"">Here</a> is a gallery of images from the Blu-ray release. We can see that, while the pants are still not as white as in the manga, they are definitely a different shade from her face:</p>

<p>I wouldn't say that Ghibli films have ""a bias against prudishness"". They'll show underwear or a bath scene if it makes sense to show it, but by anime standards, they're quite sparing with nudity and sexual themes. Miyazaki himself is usually considered a feminist; <a href=""https://bitchmedia.org/post/feminism-miyazaki-and-spirited-away-movie-princess-mononoke"">here</a> is one of many articles I found praising the feminist themes in his work. Even without all the other evidence, it just doesn't feel in character for Miyazaki to draw a heroine with no pants and no underwear running around exposing her naked rear end through an entire movie. So even if all we had was the DVD release and didn't have the Blu-ray or manga to suggest it to us, my vote would still go to ""no, she's wearing pants"".</p>

"<p>""Precursors"" or ""forerunners"" would be the title given to the society/societies that came before but they are not titles that would be classified as a genre.   The closest thing to an official genre title that you would get is, ""post-apocalyptic"". Post-apocalyptic settings are those that take place after the end of the world. in certain instances the end of the world does not mean the end of humanity and so they start the world anew. I would recommend searching post-apocalyptic animes if reborn society is what you are into. Attack On Titan, Gargantia on the Verdurous Planet, and Murder Princess, are all examples of animes with functional societies that speak of ""technology from the old world"", even though the ancient technology is futuristic by comparison to their own.

"<p>It has already been 3 thousand years with respect to the current events when the 10 Commandments fought for their race and were defeated and sealed away. Meliodas himself being a demon was definitely involved and witnessed it all. He has been alive all these thousands of years.</p>

<p>The Seven Deadly Sins were formed much more recently. The Seven Deadly Sins were an independent group of knights serving the Kingdom of Liones. So it is obvious that they have been around for a while but only during the time of Liones.</p>

<p>Gowther was recently revealed to be a doll created by a great magician. Meliodas is a demon. King is a fairy. Diane is a Giant and Ban is an immortal. Those explain why they have such long life spans. But the true nature of Escanor and Merlin has not been revealed yet.</p>

<p>Still, the Kingdom of Liones was probably founded much later after the 10 Commandments were defeated. The back stories of some of the characters have been revealed before they joined The Seven Deadly Sins. Ban and Diane for instance. They have been shown to be in their younger years living in pretty much the same timeline as the current one with no demons. So it is safe to assume that The Seven Deadly Sins were created fairly recently as compared the thousands of years.</p>

<p>Gowther is revealed to be ""Gowther the Selfless"" of the 10 Commandments. He lost his memories because of his selflessness. By the time he joined the Sins, he had no memories of his past. That means he must have been a part of the 10 Commandments before he had joined the Sins.</p>

<p>It is unclear though whether he was part of the 10 Commandments back when they were defeated 3 thousand years ago or became a part of them afterwards like Fraudrin. If Gowther was a part of the 10 commandments back then, then Meliodas probably knows about him and hasn't revealed the truth to anyone thus far.</p>

"<p>""> Within the realm of officially-licensed properties (which are produced by or with the approval of Bird Studio, Shueisha, and Toei Animation), Dragon Ball AF simply does not exist. Any AF dōjinshi, should they even exist, occupy the same canonical status as fan fiction and fan art. Akira Toriyama publicly stated that he had no intention of continuing the series (which he finished in 1995), though he has drawn a ""parody"" series, Nekomajin, in which several Dragon Ball characters appear, a one-shot crossover between Dragon Ball and One Piece, in collaboration with One Piece creator Eiichiro Oda, entitled Cross Epoch, and the OVA Dragon Ball: Yo! Son Goku and His Friends Return!!. Toriyama also oversaw production of Dragon Ball GT and played a major role in the character designs of Dragon Ball Online.""</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Dragon Ball fansite Daizenshuu EX has created a specifically-designed list[4] of the features of AF that should disprove its existence to the especially obstinate. These are:</p>
  
  <ol>
  <li>Lack of advertising in Japanese media.
  This point includes print sources (such as the Japanese Shonen Jump), TV ads, and official Japanese websites. Since Dragon Ball is well-known throughout Japan, a sequel series would not be released unpromoted, nor would it go unnoticed by the Japanese population. Daizenshuu EX took advantage of this fact, however, as part of its 2004 April Fool's joke, creating both a ""print ad"" and a ""TV commercial"" from other sources. This material, bereft of its context, has since been cited as ""evidence"" for the existence of AF.</li>
  <li>Lack of official announcements by Toriyama, Shueisha, or Toei Animation.
  Tying in to the idea of ""advertising"" above, none of the official Japanese sources of Dragon Ball material have come forward with any news on the scale of AF. Such a series would warrant at least a comment, if not an elaborately-staged introduction, from one or more of these entities. Of course, this has not stopped fans from claiming that such an announcement has already taken place (though there is no record of one ever occurring).</li>
  <li>Lack of articles, previews, or reviews of the series, in Japanese magazines or online blogs.
  Note, however, that some Japanese fans have taken to commenting on the AF phenomenon outside of Japan, and this may be regarded as commentary on the ""series"" itself by those who do not speak Japanese. Indeed, the language barrier has often been a source of obfuscation, both for those who would believe the rumors, and those whose goal is to spread them further.</li>
  <li>Lack of scans from manga releases or screen captures/movie clips from new episodes.
  While many ""faked"" images (generally produced as humorous commentary on the rumors, or outside of AF but incorporated into it accidentally) do exist, there are no raw manga scans or unaltered screenshots available, anywhere. Particularly good artwork may be mistakenly viewed as ""promotional art,"" but no media from within the manga/anime exists. Therefore, the burden of proof is on those who claim they own the series to put forth something they cannot possibly have (calls for such individuals to show whatever material they have are usually met by excuses or ad-hominem attacks).</li>
  <li>Lack of scanlations or fansubs.
  Ethical and legal issues aside, a series as popular as Dragon Ball would not long remain without a fan-translated version. The methods of digital distribution are such that it would be virtually impossible not to find such materials, even in a casual search. Neither of these two things exists, however.</li>
  <li>Lack of official merchandise.
  Dragon Ball is, and always has been, heavily marketed commercially. In Japan, a multitude of items, from action figures, to snacks, soundtracks, stationery, desks, and even children's eyedrops, have been sold as Dragon Ball products or endorsed by characters from the series. The lack of official AF merchandise, then, is a strong indicator that such a series does not in fact exist.</li>
  <li>Official denial by both Viz Media and FUNimation Entertainment.
  Such denials would run counter to the financial interests of both of these companies (the distributors of Dragon Ball manga and anime in the United States) were the rumors to be true. It is highly unlikely that they would categorically dismiss a property that could make them millions of dollars.""</li>

"<p>I have a problem with the manga Bleach.

But when they go to soul society it is clearly hinted that the shinigamis there choose their soul cutters and that the soul cutters they have have existed for generations before them. Can someone help explain this to me?</p>
"
"<p><strong>This answer can only be explained with a big spoiler. Those who hasn't read Bleach till the latest chapter and wish not to be spoiled might better avoid reading this altogether.</strong></p>

<p>Note: the way I understand it, there are 3 questions you asked.</p>

<ol>
<li>The correlation between spiritual powers and Zanpakutou's size.</li>
<li>Zanpakutou existed even before the Shinigami.</li>
<li>Did Ichigo's Zanpakutou existed before him.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Answer to Question 1</h2>

<p>A Shinigami's Zanpakutou's (soul cutter in English dub) size reflects the Shinigami's spiritual powers. The more spiritual power it unleashed, the bigger it becomes. This is generally true.</p>

<p><strong>Example 1</strong></p>

<p>Renji's Zanpakutou's <a href=""http://bleach.wikia.com/wiki/File:Ep16RenjiStandsOver.png"" rel=""nofollow"">normal shape</a> is a normal Katana. When the released into Shikai form (<a href=""http://bleach.wikia.com/wiki/File:Zabimaru.png"" rel=""nofollow"">Zabimaru</a>), it unleash more spiritual power and its shape got bigger. It gets even bigger when Renji is in Bankai state (<a href=""http://bleach.wikia.com/wiki/File:Ep52Hihi%C5%8DZabimaru.png"" rel=""nofollow"">Hihio Zabimaru</a>) and even his body is covered by his power in form of the furry cloak.</p>

<p><strong>Example 2</strong></p>

<p>Zaraki Kenpachi's Zanpakutou's <a href=""http://bleach.wikia.com/wiki/File:36Kenpachi_unsheathes.png"" rel=""nofollow"">normal form</a> is a long katana with chipped blade. When released into <a href=""http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/bleach/images/d/dc/577Nozarashi.png/revision/latest?cb=20140417055411&amp;path-prefix=en"" rel=""nofollow"">shikai</a>, his Zanpakutou changed form into a chopping axe shape.</p>

<p><strong>Example 3</strong></p>

<p>Madarame Ikkaku's Zanpakutou's <a href=""http://bleach.wikia.com/wiki/File:Ikkaku_237-122.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">normal form</a> is a normal katana. It's shikai form (<a href=""http://bleach.wikia.com/wiki/File:Ikkaku_releases_shikai.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">Houzukimaru</a>) is a spear, it's bankai form (<a href=""http://bleach.wikia.com/wiki/File:Ikkaku_Bankai.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">Ryuumon Houzukimaru</a>) is a huge blades linked with chain.</p>

<p><strong>Example 4</strong></p>

<p>Soi Fon's Zanpakutou is a <a href=""http://bleach.wikia.com/wiki/File:Soifon_Yoruichi_battle_2.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">short katana</a>. <a href=""http://bleach.wikia.com/wiki/File:Suzumebachi.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">Shikai form</a> changed it into a smaller shape, but it's <a href=""http://bleach.wikia.com/wiki/File:Soifonbankai.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">bankai</a> changed it into a big rocket launcher like thing. Notice how its shikai form is smaller that its normal form, unlike the previous two examples, which is why I said that Zanpakutou's size reflects the spiritual power is generall true. Also, so far she has never been see using her Zanpakutou in its normal, unreleased state.</p>

<p>Another exception to this is Kurosaki Ichigo. Kurosaki Ichigo's Zanpakutou is always in its shikai form. But its bankai form actually made the blade smaller, and denser, unlike bankai in general, which was noted by Kuchiki Byakuya during their fight. Byakuya also said that he don't believe that such a small sword (compared to Ichigo's shikai and bankai in general) can be his bankai.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong>
As mentioned by Ryan and Memor-X, Zanpakutou's size can be controlled. This was mentioned by Kurosaki Isshin to Grand Fisher, that if Zanpakutou's size is not controlled, those with huge Spiritual Power like the Captains, would literally have skyscrapers on their hands. </p>

<h2>Answer to Question 2</h2>

<p>Normally, a shinigami is given an Asauchi, a blank Zanpakutou created by the creator of Asauchi, <a href=""http://bleach.wikia.com/wiki/%C5%8Cetsu_Nimaiya"" rel=""nofollow"">Ouetsu Nimaiya</a>. This blank Zanpakutou will develop along with its wielder and make itself unique. This is how Shinigami normally got their Zanpakutou. Therefore, since all Zanpakutou (with the exception of Zangetsu) was an Asauchi, it can be said that it existed generations before the current generation of Shinigami).</p>

<h2>Answer to Question 3</h2>

<p>Kurosaki Ichigo's Zanpakutou, Zangetsu, is special since Ichigo is a son of Shinigami and Quincy. His father, Kurosaki Isshin is a Shinigami and his mother was a Quincy. What he used to fight until his fight with Aizen Sousuke where he lost his ""Shinigami"" powers due to the use of Final Getsuga Tenshou, was later revealed to be his Quincy powers. It was confirmed by Zangetsu (old man form) himself. Zangetsu also said that the reason his figure is so similar to that of Ywach was because Ichigo also has a Quincy blood in him. His power is in his blood, thus it can be said that his Zanpakutou existed from the very moment he was born.</p>

"<p>This is quite complicated to be fair, and the explanation has many spoilers...</p>

<p>So ichigo's powers come from a combination of</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> his mother, a quincy, so indirectly from Yhwach, and from his father, a shinigami.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He orginally got this large zanpakuto from rukia.</p>

<p><a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/jBym5.jpg"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/jBym5.jpg"" alt=""Ichigos first sword""></a></p>

<p>This was rukia's power, with the sword made large by his own large reiatsu. He lost this power after byakuya cut his chain link and soul sleep. Urahara trained ichigo, and he became a shinigami with his classic zanpakuto.</p>

<p>Lots of stuff and things happen, then he loses this power when</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> he uses the final getsuga tenshou to 'defeat' aizen.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He gets a real shinigami power back when a few captains come and give it to him. Later on, he's fighting against Jugram Haschwalth who</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> cuts his zanpakuto in two, forcing ichigo to have to go the soul palace to get it reforged, where he has to go through the process all shinigami do to get a new zanpakuto, by fighting a Asauchi. After this he speaks with hollow ichigo in his soul, who reveals he is zangetsu, and the original zangetsu was his quincy powers, and zangetsu(hollow ichigo) is his true zanpakuto. He then creates his current two sword zanpakuto when he grabs the Asauchi.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So yes, ichigo's current zanpakuto has existed before him, like all other shinigami, and was fully created when he imprinted his power onto it.</p>

<p>And now in the most recent manga issue, we finally see</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> ichigo's true final form (maybe... up till now at least!) when zangetsu has brought out his hollow powers and ichigo has the horn on the side of his face: <a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/omXhm.png"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/omXhm.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>I think... lol it's damn complicated, I probably missed something or made a mistake...</p>

"<p>To specifically answer the question. There are 2 parts.</p>

<p>The Asauchi and the Zanpaktou spirit. <a href=""http://bleach.wikia.com/wiki/Zanpakut%C5%8D"" rel=""nofollow"">reference</a></p>

<p>Asauchi are made by Ōetsu Nimaiya and given to Shinigami. In that effect, the sword does exist before the shinigami. It is this base form that can change size to refelct the spiritual pressure of the wielder. Ichigo was the example, his power was so great that when he took Rukia's Asauchi, it grew to that large size he initially had. In the Arrancar arc, Isshin Kurosaki is revealed to be a Shinigami, and he says the facts. Taken from the Refernce</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>No matter what form (or size) a Zanpakutō takes, it is always virtually effortless for its owner to wield because it is a part of its owner's soul. Shinigami captains all consciously keep their Zanpakutō in a manageable size, or else they would be holding Zanpakutō the size of skyscrapers, so one cannot judge the strength of one's opponent solely by the size of their Zanpakutō</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So normal shinigami and evne seated officers do not have a massive amount of power and therefor their swords are of normal sizes. Once you reach high ranked officers and capitains, then the sizes are naturally so massive that they must control and contain it, Else it would be the size of a skyscraper.</p>

<p>The Shikai and bankai come from the Zanpaktou spirit. They in effect are a part of the Shinigami's soul, so they can not exist before the Shinigami. It is throuhg time and pouring their power into an asauchi that it turns into a complete zanpaktou and obtains Shikai and Bankai forms. Realistically, these guys can live separately from their owner Shinigami if forcefully taken from their souls, but will never do so themselves. It is however unknown what happens to the Asauchi at this point, and whether it can ever revert back to its regular form for another Shinigami or not is unclear. what is clear however is that the Shikai and Bankai forms are of Set sizes. No matter how much power the capitains grew in, their Shikai and Bankai did not change size. Mayuri Kurotsuchi even modified his bankai and could change its size though that, as well as when new forms of the Shikai and Bankai are revealed, but at no time could The shinigami ever change its actual size at will.</p>

<p>Ichigo himself is a special case, because of his blood and situation. In any case, his Zanpaktou and other powers did not exist before him. He however only had an Asauchi when he borrowed it from Rukia. He never used Shikai in that form, but we know the Asauchi can be used by anyone, which is what ichigo did. Once he reawakend his powers with Urahara, he no longer had an Asauchi and his zanpaktou itself formed without it, Though because it was not from an Asauchi, how much of a zanpaktou it really was after that is unknown. </p>

"<p>In the beginning of the series (both 2003 and Brotherhood) Cornello takes way Ed's pocket watch in order to prevent his circle-free transmutation (which is later revealed to be pointless). From this, it was implied that the pocket watch has some sort of effect on a State Alchemist's transmutations. I seem to also recall that in the 2003 series, when Ed became a State Alchemist and was given his watch, he was told it could boost his alchemy.</p>

<p>However I don't recall any instance in either series where this was the case. It's not used as a mobile circle as each combat State Alchemist had their Transmutation Circle with them (Roy's ignition gloves, Gran's gauntlets, Armstrong's metal knuckles, Kimberly's own hands) and Shou Tucker was never shown to use his (and I doubt that he used it for producing the Alexanina Chimera because he was capable of doing this from the start, having done a similar transmutation before becoming a State Alchemist).</p>

<p>I recall at one stage the chain was used to bind someone, but what I would like to know is if there was any situation, in either series, in which the boosting capabilities of the State Alchemist pocket watch is shown to have benefited an Alchemist's transmutation (without the addition of Red Stones/Fake Philosopher Stones as per the Lior Rebellion in the 2003 series).</p>
"
"<p>It is somewhat difficult to answer this with complete certainty without analysing every single transmutation that appears in <em>Fullmetal Alchemist</em>. However, I will give an answer based on my memory and impressions of the series.</p>

<p>In the manga-based continuity, the watch appears to serve largely as a marker of identity; there is never any comment about the watch's powers. We never see the watch invoked or made reference to as a source of power when State Alchemists transmute substances.</p>

<p>I do not know the 2003 series as well, but my impression is that while the claim that the watch amplifies transmutations is reasonable, we are never actually shown an instance where it is <em>explicitly</em> used in a transmutation. It is entirely possible that the State Alchemists we see are drawing from the watch's power anyway, when they attempt transmutations, but we do not ever directly see it.</p>

<p>The current revision of <a href=""http://fma.wikia.com/wiki/State_Alchemist"" rel=""nofollow"">the FMA Wikia</a> appears to support my conclusion:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Although the manga does not describe the pocketwatch as anything more than official proof that the carrier is a State Alchemist, the 2003 anime suggests that each pocketwatch is an alchemical amplifier. The 2003 anime also depicts the watch's silver chain as extendable, as in the instance when the Strong Arm Alchemist, Major Alex Louis Armstrong uses it to tie up a target.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In particular, were there actually an instance where the watch is explicitly used, I would expect there to be a note of it here, seeing how rare such an instance would be in the course of the anime.</p>

<hr>

<p>Skimming over the early Lior arc in the manga, incidentally, I cannot find any instance where Cornello takes Edward's watch from him. The watch also does not appear in this part. (I was only able to tell that Edward had his watch because I could see the chain.) This also does not occur in FMA:B.</p>

<p>As might be expected then, the section of the Lior arc in the 2003 anime where Cornello takes Edward's watch is not in the manga-continuity. (This is after Ed and Al have escaped from the fight. Cornello turns a mob on them, and they are captured again. The watch is then taken.)</p>

"<p>Expanding my comment into an answer.</p>

<p>In Japan, it’s uncommon, but not unheard of, for <a href=""http://www.makikoitoh.com/journal/men_taking_their_wives_last_names_is_not_uncommon_in_japan"" rel=""nofollow"">a man to take his wife’s name after marriage</a>. It can happen for any reason, but a common reason is when a man marries into a family with no sons and his wife’s family wants to keep their name going.</p>

<p>In modern Japan, married couples are required to pick one partner’s family name for both of them. From <a href=""http://time.com/3940094/maiden-married-names-countries/"" rel=""nofollow"">a Time article</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In contrast, Japan requires that married couples take one of the spouses’ family names, which, unsurprisingly, means that 96% of married Japanese women assume their husband’s last name.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Any children of the marriage are given that last name as well, so if the couple chooses to use the wife’s name, the children will have their mother’s family name.</p>

<p>In anime, of course, this is used as a plot device, and the exact reason depends on the show. For instance, in Evangelion, Gendou takes Yui’s last name, Ikari, to try and distance himself from some of the unsavory things he did in the past. So Shinji gets his mother’s name, which might have various meanings, given all the Freudian subtext in the show. </p>

<p>So they didn't skip the fourth hokage, they just reinstated the third one after the fourth...</p>

"<p>In the last couple of seasons of anime, I've noticed quite a few shows being set in or using characters from the Touhoku region, especially around Aomori. Examples of shows include Kumamiko: Girl Meets Bear (set in Kumade Village somewhere in northern Touhoku); Flying Witch (set in Aomori) and Wake Up, Girls! (set in Sendai), while characters include Megumi Tadokoro from Shokugeki no Soma.</p>

<p>Is it just coincidence? Or a desire to pick a setting other than Tokyo or Osaka? Or some kind of reaction to the Touhoku earthquake?</p>

"<p>I have a theory that Summer Rose is Ruby Roses's mother and Raven (last name:??) is Yang's mother (obviously!). I believe when Raven went on that mission so long ago (after she gave birth to Yang, of course), something came up and caused Raven to stay out on her mission for years to come. That lead TaiYang to believe that Raven had disappeared or died. Then, he took his old teammate Summer Rose and married her and got Ruby,</p>

<p>When Summer died, I think he thought he was a lone man raising two children and his brother (Uncle Qrow) to help, so he didn't want to marry again because he didn't want his heart to be broken once more. And I don't feel like Neo would be part of the family. It may be a coincidence that somehow they both bought the same necklace, but no one knows for sure. Thus, leading up to my Theory. Again, this is a theory and I may be wrong.</p>

"<p><strong>Timeline as figured by me</strong><br>
1.Kokuo(Han) was captured BEFORE shipuuden start<br></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Kokuō, after living in an unspecified forest, eventually fell into the possession of Iwagakure and was sealed into Han, but was captured and extracted by Akatsuki. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>2.Gyuki was captured BEFORE shipuuden starts<br></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the anime, during a joint Chūnin Exams between Konohagakure and Sunagakure, Fū attempted to stop the Suna-nin Hōichi from extracting Shukaku from its host Gaara. Her failed attempt caused her to draw the attention of Hōichi, who also began extracting Chōmei from Fū.[6] Ultimately, the extraction was stopped by the intervention of Neji Hyūga, who used his Gentle Fist to block the chakra points from which Chōmei was being extracted, thereby repelling the chains.[7] Fū was later captured by Akatsuki members Kakuzu and Hidan, leading to Chōmei being extracted from its jinchūriki and sealed within the Demonic Statue of the Outer Path.[8]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Shipuuden Starts<br><br>
3.Deidara (and Sasori) capture Shukaku (Gaara) - Naruto Returns<br></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>During Gaara's time as the Fifth Kazekage, Deidara and Sasori from the Akatsuki were assigned to capture Shukaku.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>4.Hidan and Kakuzu capture Matatabi (Yugito) - Akatsuki Suppression; Asuma Dies<br></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Soon after her introduction, Yugito was captured by two Akatsuki members, Hidan and Kakuzu. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>5.Tobi and Deidara capture Isubo the three tails - Naruto starts his wind training<br></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the manga, Tobi and Deidara confronted the beast around the same time Naruto Uzumaki had begun his Wind Release training, to which it responded by beginning to chase Tobi. With the Three-Tails distracted, Deidara moulded an explosive clay fish in an attempt to capture it.<br> This was a filler arc in the Anime, wherein Leaf tried to capture the beast and failed</p>
</blockquote>

<p>6.Kisame capture Son Goku(Roshi) - Itachi is pursued; Sasuke Vs Deidara<br></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>After an unseen and difficult battle with Kisame Hoshigaki, Rōshi was defeated and captured by the Akatsuki member</p>
</blockquote>

<p>7.Anime only: Saiken (Utakata) is captured by Pain<br></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the anime, in an attempt to stop the Fury technique from causing untold destruction, Utakata went into his full Six-Tails form to shield the blast. Later, Utakata was confronted and captured by Nagato's Six Paths of Pain. Afterwards, Saiken was extracted from Utakata's body, being sealed into the Demonic Statue of the Outer Path, thus killing the jinchūriki in the process. </p>
  
  <p>So 2 beasts were captured before anime started. The 4th Mizukage's beast was roaming alone for some reason and Utakata's beast I am not sure about. In Anime, its shown after Roshi, need a rewatch to confirm. As I remember Utakata was captured while Sasuke fought Itachi and Jiraiya, Pain. </p>

"<p>I shall talk about Uzumaki Naruto as such..Since, it is a special case.. Uzumaki clan at the time of Naruto birth(and later) were a few in number.. Mostly scattered throughout the world. Also, many decided to change their names fearing for their lives( the Uzumaki clan is quite noted for its Sealing jutsus; which was feared a lot, especially during the wartimes such as Shinobi World war 1,2 and 3). The seal which binds the Kyuubi(Nine-tailed fox) in Naruto is itself a Uzumaki Clan's jutsu. 
Also, since it was not given of any other person from Namikaze clan except for Minato, we can fairly assume Namikaze clan too was dwindling in numbers. 
Now, why was Naruto named after his mother? Interesting, right (since both clans had less members)? 
This is because of the fact that Minato Namikaze was the 4th Hokage, meaning he had his enemies. Thus, naming Naruto after his father's clan was quite dangerous. (Note that the enemies pursuing Uzumaki clan dwindled once peaceful times started after the world war 3, except for people like Orochimaru that is. )</p>

"<p>If you have already read about Rin, you would know that she sacrificed herself for the sake of Konoha. Also, she was close to Obito and Kakashi. The death of her (at the hands of Kakashi) made Obito to writhe in pain. This is also the case with Kakashi. It hence, is that as a result of Rin's death, the Mangekyou Sharingan was awakened in Kakashi. 
But, the usage of Mangekyou Sharingan by a non-Uchiha demands additional amount of chakra to be spent than by a corresponding Uchiha. </p>

"<p>The answer to your question is quite complex and can best be summarized succinctly as -- ""maybe"".  The death MAY play out exactly as you wrote it, it may play out similarly, but with someone or something else causing the bleeding, or he may die of a heart attack.  Or if certain criteria are met he may not die (but most likely he will!).</p>

<p>Let's dig in.</p>

<hr>

<h3>Rules of the trade</h3>

<p>A complete list of rules from the comics and manga is <a href=""http://deathnote.wikia.com/wiki/Rules_of_the_Death_Note"">compiled here</a>.</p>

<p>Note, while many share the first 10, there's more rules in the canon than that.  In total there are at least 66 rules that have been compiled from the source material, many of which are found in the thirteenth manga volume, <em><a href=""http://deathnote.wikia.com/wiki/Death_Note_13:_How_to_Read"">Death Note 13: How to Read</a></em>.</p>

<p>Some rules that are applicable to this scenario/question include:</p>

<p><code>Rule VI.1</code></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The conditions for death will not be realized unless it is physically
  possible for that human or it is reasonably assumed to be carried out
  by that human.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><code>Rule X.2</code></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Whether the cause of the individual's death is either a suicide or
  accident, if the death leads to the death of more than the intended,
  the person will simply die of a heart attack. This is to ensure that
  other lives are not influenced.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><code>Rule XXVI.2</code></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Even though only one name is written in the Death Note, if it
  influences and causes other humans that are not written in it to die,
  the victim's cause of death will be a heart attack.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><code>Rule XLII.1</code></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The use of the Death Note in the human world sometimes affects other
  humans' lives or shortens their original life span, even though their
  names are not actually written in the Death Note itself. In these
  cases, no matter the cause, the god of death sees only the original
  lifespan and not the shortened lifespan.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><code>Rule LV.1</code></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In occasions where the cause and situation of death is written before
  the victim's name, multiple names can be written as long as they are
  written within 40 seconds and the causes and situations of death are
  not impossible to occur.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><code>Rule LV.2</code></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the occasion where the cause of death is possible but the situation
  is not, only the cause of death will take effect for that victim. If
  both the cause and the situation are impossible, that victim will die
  of heart attack.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><code>Rule LVIII.1</code></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>By manipulating the death of a human that has influence over another
  human's life, that human's original life span can sometimes be
  lengthened.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><code>Rule LVIII.2</code></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If a god of death intentionally does the above manipulation to
  effectively lengthen a human's life span, the god of death will die,
  but even if a human does the same, the human will not die.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><code>Rule LIX.1</code></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A human death caused by Death Note will indirectly lengthen some other
  human's original life even without a specific intention to lengthen a
  particular person's original life span in the human world.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<h3>Basic rules precluding death</h3>

<p>So let us assume a couple things:</p>

<ul>
<li>Bob Schneider isn't going to die otherwise within the next 12 minutes</li>
<li>"""" hasn't been targeted with a different death scenario from another Death Note.</li>
<li>"""" is older than 780 days (~2 years) and is younger than 124 years old.</li>
<li>"""" does not own a Death Note.</li>
</ul>

<p>If any of the above are false, additional rules preventing the death would kick in.</p>

<hr>

<h3>General feasibility w/ example from the source material</h3>

<p>Now the Death Note allows people to write in a situation, perhaps even with familiar characters (this aspect is somewhat unclear).  A good example is the death of <a href=""http://deathnote.wikia.com/wiki/Matsushiro_Nakaokaji"">Matsushiro Nakaokaji</a>, a robber and murderer who is killed by Light who writes that the target bleeds to death at 1:30 p.m.  He was stabbed by a store employee and winds up dying at the prescribed time.</p>

<p><a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/M5fIS.jpg""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/M5fIS.jpg"" alt=""Death of Matsushiro Nakaokaji""></a></p>

<p>This establishes that, yes, assuming the conditions are feasible (see in particular LV.1-2), you can use the Death Note to manipulate someone other than the victim into killing them.</p>

<hr>

<h3>Death by a best friend stabbing</h3>

<p>So what does this mean in practice?</p>

<p>Well, likely Bob's best friend has to have considered stabbing him, which seems fairly likely, based on the lose definition of potential outlined in the rules regarding suicide.  Also, the friend likely has to be physically present and have an accessible knife to ensure feasibility (most homes would meet this criteria as they have knives in the kitchen).</p>

<p>If it is feasible, the next question is whether the attack will somehow result in the friend dying as well.  If so, Rules X.2 and XVI.2 clearly state Bob will instead die of a heart attack, to prevent additional deaths. Note that Rule XLLII.1 state that it's fine to short the characters lifespan (let's say Bob fights back and stabs the friend with a non-life ending injury that nonetheless shortens his life, i.e. laceration of the spleen or kidney).</p>

<p>Now let's assume that it's not feasible for that best friend, either because they're not capable of harboring such thoughts, are physical incapable (maybe they're paralyzed), or would die in the process of the attack.  Then that friend will definitely not commit the attack.</p>

<p>Does Bob have multiple best friends?</p>

<p>If so, likely the above criteria repeats.  If one best friend would die  from the stabbing, perhaps the situation will pass to a friend that meets the feasibility criteria and wouldn't die.  So maybe best friend 1 is a nerd and best friend 2 is a gym rat... the note would likely avoid the nerdy friend who would die of the counterattack, and instead pick the gym rat, who could carry out the deed without dying himself.</p>

<p>Unknowns include which best friend is chosen first and how/why, assuming there's multiple ""best friends"" of Bob capable of killing him.</p>

<hr>

<h3>Death by someone else stabbing him or some accident causing bleeding</h3>

<p>Now if no friends are capable of killing him, than the next question, per LV.1-2 is whether someone else would be capable of stabbing him.  Say he's at the store at 13:30 p.m. and no friends are around, but other people are and one of them has a knife.</p>

<p>Again, assuming no one else but Bob will die as a result of the attack and the attacker has considered stabbing a random stranger (or casual acquaintance if they happen to know Bob), then the stabbing may still occur, just not the written situation.</p>

<p>Or something else will happen to Bob (i.e. a piano falling on his leg) that causes him to bleed out at the specified time.  The requirement of no additional deaths, however, would precluding many accidents that might satisfy this end, though (think massive highway crash, etc., which would likely produce multiple fatalities).</p>

<p>If there's multiple possibilities to fulfill the cause of death, if the situation was deemed infeasible or would lead to additional deaths, it's unclear which would be picked (as with the question of which best friend would kill him if multiple are capable). Perhaps it's random.  Perhaps there's some unknown rule.</p>

<hr>

<h3>Final fall-through: death by heart attack</h3>

<p>If there's no way he's going to get stabbed or otherwise maimed in such a way to bleed out (say Bob is in an underground bunker, far from friends and other dangers) -- or if ALL such circumstances would lead to additional deaths -- then he will die from a heart attack at the ascribed time.</p>

"<p>One of the interest plot constructs in the <em>Priest</em> (manhwa) series by <code>Hyung Min-woo</code> is the antagonist <a href=""http://priest.wikia.com/wiki/Temozarela"" rel=""nofollow"">Temozarela</a>.</p>

<p>He is summarized as:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Temozarela is an arch-angel who fought on God's side in the war
  against Lucifer. However, this war caused God to lose faith in the
  angels and prefer humanity instead.</p>
  
  <p>Temozarela, bitter at this, took twelve angels to Earth to prove to
  God how flawed humans are. He set up a cult for the fallen angels

<p>I did some Google searching as I was curious whether this character (<code>Temozarela</code>) was a wholly new creation of the author. I could find no prior source material, not under that name at least.</p>

<p>Does prior fictional or religious source material for <code>Temozarela</code> exist under the same name or alternate names?</p>

"<p>Nowhere, is it ever shown that the Nara family have been using a summoned animal in the anime. So, it can only be speculated that they don't use(/have) a summoning animal. The deers that belong to the Nara's clan can be taken as a rearing of their clan. 
As far as your answer for the chakra type of Shikamaru Nara is concerned, it refers to the Yin form of release. Now basically, to mould chakra one needs to mould the Physical and Spiritual energies within ourselves in the right combination. The spiritual energy is the Yin form(or Yin release) and the Physical energy the yang release. </p>

<p>Hence, the Yin release is nothing but the Spiritual energy that Shinobis use ,can be used in a wide variety of forms. Good examples of it are the (all) Genjutsus used and also the Shadow manipulating jutsu of the Nara clan.</p>

<p>The Yin release can be based on our imagination and also be used to create form out of nothingness. It is the same concept coupled with the Yang release (used to give life into an object or form) that led to the creation of the the Nine-tailed beasts from the chakra of the Ten-tails by the Sage of the Six paths (called as the Creation of All Things Technique). </p>

<p>If you want more information, I suggest you go through the Naruto Wiki articles on Yin Release, Yang release and Yin-Yang Release.</p>

"<p>Episode 7 of <em>Koutetsujou no Kabaneri</em> brings up the point that nobody in Japan eats rice anymore, since the rice paddies are outside the stations, and hence overrun by the <em>kabane</em>. </p>

<p>This makes a lot of sense, and is a splendid bit of worldbuilding. But if they can't grow rice, what staple food(s) do they grow and eat instead? </p>

<hr>

<p>Out of all the common staple foods currently eaten, it seems that potatoes (or sweet potatoes) can provide the most calories-per-unit-area, clocking in at about 4-5 times as much as rice. But at just 4-5 times rice's calorie/area yield, they'd have to have lost no more than 75-80% of their arable land to maintain the same calorie output. Judging from the sizes of the stations we've seen, it doesn't seem plausible that they still have that much arable land - we see the railforts driving through days of outside-station land between stations.</p>

<p>Perhaps the resolution here is that Japan's population has dipped so precipitously in the face of the <em>kabane</em> menace that the meager amount of land enclosed by the stations does suffice to grow enough of some other staple crop to feed the people?</p>

"<p>One incident that I think is relevant to this question is (spoiler for those who haven’t seen it):</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Kiichiro Osoreda is killed during the bus hijacking, however the written cause of death is simply ""traffic accident""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Whilst this is entirely possible and likely on any road even without being written, the face that the written instructions are carried out (the realistic rule) implies that even in a minor way, the Death Note has exuded influence on a driver for a car to be there at the exact time, not swerve etc, and therefore accidentally cause a death.</p>

<p>Under this thinking, it would be entirely possible for Bob to be stabbed by his friend, either on purpose or accidentally, if in a situation where it COULD happen.</p>

<p>However:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Whether the cause of the individual's death is either a suicide or accident, if the death leads to the death of more than the intended, the person will simply die of a heart attack. This is to ensure that other lives are not influenced.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>makes things a bit tricky. Say Bob is stabbed accidentally, and the friend (Steve or whatever)'s life is influenced by this, either a jail term or depression that WOULD (hypothetically and assuming no further changes) lead to him committing suicide. This is a direct link, and therefore could be seen to cause 2 deaths, and as a result Bob would die of a heart attack.</p>

"<p>Yes, you are correct. After the calamity ends, the records are restored (even photographs), and some (maybe all, maybe none) of the memories.</p>

<p>Tatsuji keeps careful records of all classes 3-3. Since he reveals the truth about Mami in 1998, the data was already restored.</p>

<p>It is not shown, but he probably also tracks the deaths.</p>

<p>It is not shown if Tatsuji's memories were erased or not.  We know that the records both written and graphical (photographs) are edited and the extra removed - and later repositioned - name and image. But the memory of the calamity is not erased. People know that deaths occured. For someone tracking the calamity for as long as Tetsuji, and that know of the phenomena around the extra's records could spot a blank where something <strong>should</strong> be there. The calamity does not prevent discovery of the extra through sleuthing.</p>

<p>He could restore the information by crossing data from the records. The ""extra"" would be evident because there is no enrollment papers, no admission exam score, etc. Also the duplicate name.</p>

<p>As people remembering, it is blurry. People involved in a calamity class usually die or won't want to remember or keep themselves involved with the school.</p>

<p>So probably when Mami returned (or anyone else, for that matter) nobody that once knew her in life was there to remember.</p>

"<p>Okay, there is this background music that is quite frequently played in Beyblade V-Force. I tried searching for it online but had no luck. Even though this song/music is played at some point in almost all the episodes, I am going to be specific on just two episodes that it is played. Those episodes are 14 and 36. </p>

<p>In episode 14, it is played during the start when they are summing up the previous episode. And in episode 36, it's played when Max and Mariam are trapped in the rubble and they use their beyblades and bit beasts to break out and escape.</p>

"<p>I really like the ""Meitantei Conan"" anime, but I've always wanted to know, why is was the name translated to ""Case Closed"" when it was localized? </p>

"<p>I am rewatching the anime currently, about half way through episode 5 there is a part in which Eren and others were in a class learning about titans. Their teacher started with ""What little we know about their bodies , we learned from Recon corps most recent report ""..and then he continues teaching them how are titans killed.

"<p>In episode 27 of <em>Ushio to Tora</em> (2015-16 version), we come to learn that Hakumen no Mono has used memory-altering <em>hiyou</em> to make almost everybody forget about Ushio and Tora (Jie Mei, Saya, Hyou, and Tokisaka/Tokijun are spared for various reasons). </p>

<p>In particular, in episode 27, we specifically see Kirio having lost his memories of Ushio and Tora. Then, in episode 29 (he doesn't appear in episode 28), we see that he's regained his memories of the two of them. </p>

<p>How did that happen? (The anime seems to be eliding a bunch of details in order to fit the rest of the story into this cour, and this seems like one of those things that would've been cut.)</p>
"
"<p>So, this is a difficult question to answer because for the most part, the anime covered the important points. As far as I know, season 1 of the anime covered it sufficiently and left out trivial things. They did switched out studios for season 2, however. Season 1 was done by Brain Base and season 2 was done by Studio Feel. </p>

<p>With that said, there are a lot of things that the first episodes of S2 did not explain that are highly important. You can see a detail of it in <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/33oafj/spoilers_yahari_ore_no_seishun_love_comedy_wa/cqmurdt"" rel=""nofollow"">this detailed Reddit post</a>. In summary, it explains to non-LN readers why Yukinon is acting the way she is. LN readers would understand why and they can see the little things like facial expression and other things that might be overt. Non-LN anime watchers would have to be very attentive to capture the information otherwise.</p>

<p>This isn't a simple yes or no answer. If you don't have the time to read the LN then I recommend you watch the anime as it is, as far as I know, comprehensive. If you care about details or were confused by some of things going on, then either read the LN or read the analysis for the episodes.</p>

"<p>in fairy tail erza can use requip, but I wanna know how she gets her weapons and armor there in the first place, her ability in fairy tail is <strong>not</strong> to put and leave items there its only for switching, so how did she place all her armour there in the first place?.</p>
"
"<p>Erza's reequip magic is where she stores armor and weapons in a pocket dimension and put the on whenever she wants. fairy tail wiki direct quote:</p>

<p>This Magic allows the users to store items in a pocket dimension so they can easily summon it at any time, even during battle, which gives them a high level of flexibility in combat. However, there is a limit to how much the pocket dimension can store. Reequip can be used for simple or combat-related purposes. Some users may just choose to use it to change their clothing. More skilled users are able to Reequip different weapons in battle, and it is even possible to Reequip armors in the midst of battle, although the only Mages to ever do this are Erza Scarlet and Coordinator.</p>

<p>In my memory, i do remember that there was a OVA or a special episode or something where Lucy took a job where she dressed up as a cat girl and was looking for treasure for an old lady who turned out to be the person who raised Erza and some other children. in there, lucy went to Erza's room in a scene and Erza shows her her other armor and explains her magic(my memory might be wrong though, but fairy tail wiki is correct) the special came out when there was only 77 episodes of Fairy tail i think.</p>

<p>Hope this helps</p>
"
"<p>Lets see what wiki has to say about this.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Requip is a type of Spatial Magic and Erza's signature form of Magic, over which she possesses great mastery. It is a type of Magic that allows her to swap weapons, armor and clothes at will. Her particular form of Requip is called The Knight.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lets look at what spatial magic means.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This Magic revolves around the manipulation of space, which can allow the user to harass the asset for battle, travel, accessing alternate dimensions, and so on. This Magic is also used in conjunction for summoning concrete material or extraterrestrial beings to their stead, such as being able to conjure up armor and weapons or allow Celestial Spirits access to the human world.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This means her ability is to manipulate that space. So you're wrong to suggest she can't put items in that space.
This means Erza can store, as well as take back armors, swords etc using her spatial magic. Her Armors disappear after being damaged supposedly back to the same space. </p>

<p>I would like to address that the size of the pocket Dimension is limited. So Erza can infact put weapons and the rest are stored in her house. Again from the wiki </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Erza owns over 100 different types of armor, and over 200 different types of weapons. <br>
  This Magic allows the user to store weapons and armors in pocket dimensions and summon them during battle.[...]<br>
  The only known user, Erza, stated that there is a limit to how much the pocket dimension can store, and as a result, she leaves some of her armors in her room in Fairy Hills.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don't know how Erza creates new or repairs damaged armors. From a different question it was answered </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Erza is an user of requip magic, in other words, she can summon weapons and armors during the battles, but she does not create them.<br><a href=""http://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/14015/how-many-sets-of-armor-does-erza-have/14020#14020"">Answer Source</a></p>

"<p>During the anime and the manga, the author refers to Midori as green-skinned, in fact, even her name means green. But she doesn't look obviously green:</p>

<p><a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/L4fpVm.jpg"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/L4fpVm.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>In the manga there is a panel with RGB codes, I thought I'd color her in just to make sure it wasn't an anime adaption problem &amp; I removed the shading:</p>

<p><a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/kbzYrm.png"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/kbzYrm.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a>

<p>Midori's skin is hex value #85D8D0 or RGB (133,216,208). The green component of her skin is only 8 units larger than the blue component. Thus, even without my subjectiveness, she can't be considered green-skinned. Several color-focused websites classify the color as Cyan, not a shade of green.</p>

<p>Is there some reason for this - <a href=""http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=17970"" rel=""nofollow"">maybe based in language</a>? Why didn't they just say she was cyan / aqua / turqoise? or even, blue?</p>

"<p>Japanese has multiple words for the color <em>turquoise</em>:</p>

<ul>
<li>ターコイズブルー  (turquoise blue) this is used for dominating blue or neutral</li>
<li>ターコイズグリーン (turquoise green) this is used for dominating green.</li>
</ul>

<p>The green part in ターコイズグリーン isn't 緑 (midori), but Midori is a common girl's name.</p>

<p>And she is probably called green-skinned, because turquoise-green-skinned is way too long. So they only use the last part.</p>

<p>Source for Japanese words: <a href=""https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%82%BF%E3%83%BC%E3%82%B3%E3%82%A4%E3%82%BA%E3%83%96%E3%83%AB%E3%83%BC"" rel=""nofollow"">Wikipedia</a></p>

"<p>Think of it this way, Midori is what the Japanese would refer to as a ""<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyaru"" rel=""nofollow"">Gyaru</a>.""</p>

<p>One of the more popular styles of gyaru is ""<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganguro"" rel=""nofollow"">Ganguro</a>"", characterized by their deeply artificial tan and dyed/bleached hair.</p>

<p><a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/SVuDg.jpg"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/SVuDgm.jpg"" alt=""so gyaru""></a> </p>

<p>Green skin might refer to her natural skin color. It's likely that she chose another hue as the bronze shade of typical ganguro gyaru is too similar to her original color. After all, ganguro gyarus are not only into radical fashions radical fashions, but also radical makeup. So some order more radically different shade makes sense in this context.</p>

<p>You make the mistake in thinking ""midori"" can only refer to the kanji [緑]{midori}. If your are unaware the kanji [青]{ao} refers to both the color blue and green (more commonly the former nowadays). Another way to write this kanji is 碧. While typically pronounced ""ao,"" <a href=""http://midorinohappa.wix.com/midori"" rel=""nofollow"">many</a> <a href=""http://www.midorikomachi.com/%E6%97%A5%E6%9C%AC%E8%AA%9E/"" rel=""nofollow"">people</a> <a href=""https://www.lessismore.co.jp/staff/MidoriNishimura"" rel=""nofollow"">take</a> <a href=""http://vocaloid.wikia.com/wiki/%E7%B5%A1%E7%B9%B0%E5%B8%AB%E3%81%A8%E7%A2%A7_(Karakurishi_to_Midori)"" rel=""nofollow"">it</a> as a given name and pronounce it as ""Midori."" The name here might be use in an ironic sense (character design wise), like calling a black cat ""White.""</p>

<p>Cyan is a greenish-blue or a light blue color. This fits her character and name in two ways:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>When tanning your skin color you have to take into account your natural tone, unless you are painting over it completely</p></li>
<li><p>Her name is a bit of a pun on her complexion, she's both green (underneath) and blue (outside)</p></li>

"<p>I feel there are way too many misconceptions on this topic. I don't understand where half these answers are coming from, as a naruto fan for over 11 years now.</p>

<p><strong>Tsunade:</strong></p>

<p>I saw someone speak of Tsunade's strong taijutsu. Tsunade is a horribly weak fighter. The reason she's can punch so hard is because of her chakra control, which she fully explained to Sakura in the training flashbacks. Mind you, that she was <em>losing to Kabuto</em>. It was often stated that Kabuto was <em>""Just on Kakashi's level""</em>. Meanwhile, Kabuto was one of the strongest people in the series. Don't forget that Tsunade is a medic and not a fighter. She's exceptional as a medic, not as a fighter. As a fighter she's just your everyday jounin level.</p>

<p><strong>Jiraiya:</strong>
I saw someone answer about his taijutsu as well, stating it's so strong because of his Frog Kimute. Well, he can only use that in sage mode. Either way, I do believe Jiraiya was the strongest of the sannin and would indeed quite easily beat Kakashi. There is simply no doubt about this... or is there? The fact is that these people know each other well. If Jiraiya wouldn't know about Kakashi's sharingan, specifically his ""I'm gonna shoot you into another dimension!"" trick, He'd probably lose by surprise. Kakashi is an assassin type ninja and would almost always win a fight when it came to trickery.</p>

<p><strong>Orochimaru:</strong></p>

<p>I'm quite sure Orochimaru would win, simply because he's pretty much immortal. He has a lot of very dirty tricks and Kakashi wouldn't have the chakra/stamina to keep up the fight. Without that, Kakashi would probably win, though.</p>

<p><strong>Obito:</strong></p>

<p>Obito would probably kick Kakashi's ass, but he would also kick the asses of the Sannin. People like Orochimaru posed no threat to him at all. Obito is super OP. besides this, his Sharingan is way stronger than Kakashi's.</p>

<p><strong>Itachi:</strong></p>

<p>Kakashi would simply lose to Itachi. Itachi is possibly the strongest character to have ever existed. A lot of people tend to say ""Aside from Obito/Madara"", but I disagree. Itachi was the most genius ninja ever known to anyone, as far as we know. All we have seen from Itachi was a display of power while he was dying. We have, not once, seen Itachi go full power. His Susanoo's was so strong for a reason, though. Although Madara is sickeningly OP, I wouldn't be so sure that Obito is stronger than Itachi, let alone Kakashi.</p>

<p><strong>Kakashi himself:</strong></p>

<p>It should be noted that Kakashi's power hasn't been extremely stable throughout the series. Kakashi is known for having a laughably small chakra pool. Pretty much every genin we've seen has had a bigger chakra pool than Kakashi, especially when he uses his Sharingan.
Having said that, Kakashi is known for being a tactical genius. He's an assassin-type ninja, and would kill nearly anyone if he, for once, was the ambusher. He analyses every situation perfectly and always finds a great plan to deal with it.
That being said, absurdly OP people like orochimaru and Itachi wouldn't be bothered by it, as orochimaru immortal and Itachi is just as much a genius as Kakashi is, if not even more so. Basically, Kakashi would win almost any fight if he was the one to initiate it and his opponent would actually die from having their hearts deleted... :P</p>

<p>-- my final conlusion is: No, Kakashi did not surpass them in the sense of all-round power, but he did surpass them in a strategical sense. Basically, you'd want Kakashi as your team-leader, where as Jiraiya should be the one he's bossing around. Kakashi is basically the boogeyman. He's most dangerous when you don't see him :)</p>

"<p>In many times we are viewing a story without paying. It can be an animation boardcast on television. It can be comic or light novel that is only translated by volunteer online and one is forced to view the pirated version as this is the only way to view it. So there should be times we feel that want to have some ways to pay some money back to support the comic / light novel writer or the animation company. </p>

<p>Currently the most common way to do so is to buy some products, like BlueRay Disk, poster, figures, toys and video games etc. However, when the comic / novel / animation is so rare that you are forced to view a pirated version, it usually means it is also impossible to buy these products.  Even if it is possible, it feels odd to buy unnecessary stuff just to show my support. Sometimes it is just not environmentally friendly, and somteimes (think of strike witches) you really need to be brave enough to just possess the product itself. </p>

<p>Then I think of the donation page or the ""Buy me a beer"" button in many free software site. (like <a href=""http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/contribute"" rel=""nofollow"">this one</a>) So I am thinking if there are similar things for ACGN?</p>

"<p>A recurring story element that I've noticed is the accessibility of certain evil/dark devices at midnight.</p>

<li>In the <a href=""http://sailormoon.wikia.com/wiki/Mysterious_Sleeping_Illness!_Protect_the_Girls&#39;_Hearts_in_Love"" rel=""nofollow"">third episode</a> of <em>Sailor Moon</em>, girls listen to a midnight radio show that is hosted by the antagonists illegally.

</ol>

<p>Why do all three of these anime use midnight as a time for evil? What is special about midnight that sets it apart from any other time?</p>
"
"<p>This is an example of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathetic_fallacy"" rel=""nofollow"">pathetic fallacy</a>, more specifically an <a href=""http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmpathicEnvironment"" rel=""nofollow"">empathic environment</a>. i.e. giving an environment a percieved emotion.

<p>Some other examples include:</p>

<li>A calm breeze after turmoil has subsided.</li>
<li>A big storm buffets the castle walls as the evil king rages</li>
<li>The sun appears from the clouds as the characters see a new path to follow after being downtrodden</li>
<li>It snows and the land is harsh when a man is exiled from the city. </li>

"<p>I'm not really sure what the confusion is here. Before he is a licensed hero, he was a literally a superhero by the sheer virtue of him both being a superhuman and a person who does benevolent deeds. <a href=""http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hero"" rel=""nofollow"">A simple definition taken from Mirriam Webster</a> shows that a hero is:</p>

<ul>
<li>a :  a mythological or legendary figure often of divine descent
endowed with great strength or ability </li>
<li>b :  an illustrious warrior</li>
<li>c    :  a man admired for his achievements and noble qualities </li>
<li>d :     one    who shows great courage</li>
</ul>

<p>He meets B, C, and D. He is a warrior because, well, he fights things as his trade. He is admired by Genos. He shows great courage by shrugging off his opponents. </p>

"<p>I remember that the actual way that I learned to be fluent in English were by watching a lot of English movies.

How I learned English was memorizing the fun dialogues and I want to do the same for Japanese. Since Japanese is not so easy to pick up and having Kanji to search for is definitely informative. </p>

<p>How can we get the subtitles for a specific anime? If it were lyrics it would've been easy, but I didn't find any sites that would give subtitles of the dialogues of anime. Are there any? If not, what can be done so that we can learn dialogues of the anime, since songs and dialogues are definitely easier to memorize.</p>

"<p>I was under the impression that Kisuke's shop is where it is in order to stay out of the eyes of the Soul Society. yet during the start of Season 4 Renji is ""mooching"" off the Urahara Shop, and it doesn't seem Renji was in need to help at any time which would lead to Kisuke offering help unlike with Rukia where it was shown that after she lost her powers she was approached by Kisuke.</p>

<p>So i am wondering if the Soul Society knew that Kisuke was set up in Karakura Town and thus directed Renji to seek his aid. if not then how did Renji end up there?</p>

  <p>I know this has been pointed out before in the flashback that Monet had normal human limbs, but I still like to think that there is a harpy race out there.</p>
  
  <p>Perhaps harpies have a similar aging system to mermaids.</p>
  
  <p>*She could be switching between human and harpy form like Kokoro does. We've learned that mermaids over the age of 30 can do that. That could possibly also correlate to harpies. After all, we don't know Monet's age.
  *First you start as a normal human, then when you reach a certain age you grow wings and a tail. But you can change back and forth freely from human to harpy limbs.
  *To me, Monet's wings seem too similar to Lafitte's wings for it to be a coincidence, so Lafitte might be a Harpy too. I also don't know how sure I am since there might be some sort of angel devil fruit that Laffitte could have ate to explain his wings.</p>
  
  <p>But when I checked I found something. Monet's picture in volume cover, her legs look normal. While when you look at her other pics, her legs are in form of limbs of a harpy/bird.I have provided the pic below.
  <a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/UUEUC.jpg"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/UUEUC.jpg"" alt=""Monet&#39;s Legs analysis""></a></p>
  
  <p>So ,I think Monet is able to transform her normal limbs to Harpy limbs whenever she wants. Similar to that of mermaids.</p>
  
  <p>Another thing to note, the tips of her wings match her hair color which would not really make sense if those wings were not hers to start with. Yeah it looks more like genetic relation between wings &amp; hairs, both being green.</p>

<p>I'm not sure it makes sense that it is prosthetic and made up of Hashirama's cells, since a prosthetic limb is, by definition, artificial. The definition for prosthetic on <a href=""http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/prosthesis"" rel=""nofollow"">Merriam-Webster</a> is </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>an artificial device that replaces a missing or injured part of the body</p>

<p>Perhaps there are both organic and artificial components.</p>

<p>Well, regardless, Narutopedia states that the arm is fully maneuverable. I could be wrong on this point, but I don't think Naruto has any trouble moving the arm. So with the arm moving the same as a normal arm and with it having organic components (Hashirama's cells), I think it is reasonable to assume it is connected to his nervous system, thus allowing it to function as a normal arm.</p>

  <p>To start let me just say it has been a true honor to play such a vibrant character. Playing Pyrrha meant the absolute world to me and getting to see how much she meant to many of you as well means a lot.  </p>
  
  <p>The entire Rooster Teeth team and RWBY crew deserves so much praise for how beautifully the show was handled. I have known from the minute I was cast 3 years ago that this would be Pyrrha's fate. It was Monty's intention from the start. And although it is kind of a relief to no longer have to keep it to myself, I am very sad that her journey has come to an end. Watching that final scene was beyond emotional for me. When you've invested so much into a character it is hard to let them go.  </p>
  
  <p>Most importantly I thank Monty. I miss him every day and thank him for trusting me with Pyrrha. Monty also intended for me to play other roles after Pyrrha's exit and although I have no further details right now... I fully trust that Miles Luna and Kerry Shawcross will stay true to his wishes and have me back as someone new. I love those guys.  </p>

<p>In my experience, while most Japanese DVDs do not have subtitles in Japanese, some do. It is usually easier to find movies than TV series subtitled though.</p>

<p><strong>Streaming</strong></p>

<p>Online streaming services such as <a href=""https://www.viki.com/explore?language=ja&amp;country=japan"" rel=""nofollow"">Viki</a> have some Japanese shows with Japanese subtitles.

<p><strong>Other online resources</strong></p>

<p>Around the millennium shift some websites offered fan translations of Japan-only anime shows. That is, you could try to get the Japanese VHS/DVD and follow along with the translated script. If I remember correctly at least one of those websites had the Japanese script as well. This was before the fansubs found a home online. Maybe something similar exists today. I am not aware of any such resources though.</p>

"<p>In short, it's just a hero name which is flashier than reality.  Pun intended.  Some more recent translations have switched to using ""Flashy Flash"" instead of ""Lightspeed Flash"" specifically in order to avoid the light speed comparisons, and to better reflect the silliness in his Japanese name (Flashy Flash is a fairly literal translation).</p>

<p>In a couple pages of the webcomic we're actually given a timer on one of his actions, which allows some rough estimates of travel and attack speeds.  <a href=""http://comicvine.gamespot.com/forums/battles-7/saitama-vs-meliodas-1667719/?page=1#js-message-16163193"" rel=""nofollow"">This forum post</a> (which is itself a summary of a post somewhere else but which I don't have a link for) contains the calculations on said pages, and estimates both his movement and attack speeds (arm speed during a punch) at around 2.3% of the speed of light, which isn't even fast enough to warrant relativistic corrections.  It's hard to say what the error margin is on those, for a variety of reasons, though it should be well within an order of magnitude&mdash;20% of the speed of light would warrant the use of special relativity, at least.  However, the calculations also assume that ONE's depiction of the scene is reasonably close to scale (and his drawing skills make that questionable), and that he actually drew it to that scale after deciding how fast he really wanted Flashy Flash, aka Lightspeed Flash, to go.  The scene in question also occurs during a very serious sequence where Flash knows that many of the best combatants in S class have been defeated, so it is reasonable to assume this is near or at his maximum speed.</p>

<p>There hasn't been an official description of how fast he truly is, so this is the best we've currently got on his capabilities.</p>

<p>Here are the webcomic pages in question:</p>

"<p>What did Kirito whisper during his fight with Zekken before which he was  defeated? In episode 20, Asuna asked Zekken (Yuuki) about this and she replied that Kirito had ""figured out [her] secret"".</p>

<p>What was the secret?</p>
"
"<p>In episode 19, Asuna reports that Leafa thought that Kirito had had an exchange with Zekken during their fight. Kirito then tells Asuna about what happened:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Kirito:</strong> Um, something was bothering me.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Asuna:</strong> What?</p>
  
  <p><strong>Kirito:</strong> I asked, ""You're totally living in this world, aren't you?"" Zekken answered with a wordless smile and a charge skill at incredibly speed. That speed was beyond the limits.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Asuna:</strong> ""Totally living in this world""? Do you mean they're a really heavy user?</p>
  
  <p><strong>Kirito:</strong> No. I wasn't referring to a single VRMMO. I felt like Zekken was a product of the full-dive environment itself.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Asuna:</strong> What does that mean?</p>
  
  <p><strong>Kirito:</strong> I don't want to give you any preconceived notions. I want you to feel the rest for yourself.</p>

<p>(Text from Crunchyroll subtitles.) Thus, that she is ""totally living in this world"" must be the ""secret"" that Yuuki is referring to; we do not hear of Kirito having any major interactions with Yuuki at any point prior to their duel. Furthermore, Kirito's intuition is correct. Spoilers for the rest of the arc:</p>

  <p> In episode 22, Kirito states his guess that Yuuki is a Medicuboid user and directs Asuna to the only hospital in Japan using the device.
 We then learn that Yuuki is an AIDS patient. She has been using the Medicuboid machine experimentally to alleviate the suffering caused by her health problems. Beyond providing pain relief and alleviating sensory impairments, the Medicuboid can also immerse the user in a virtual reality environment, such as that of the video games being played in the SAO universe.</p>

"<blockquote>
  <p>Meteoroid-falling, burning, and disappear, then...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is just the title of S1E13 - 「流れ星、堕ちて燃えて尽きて、そして―」. This refers to how, after Hibiki/Chris/Tsubasa attacked the chunk of the moon knocked loose by Kadingir, the resulting fragments fell to Earth as shooting stars, i.e. meteors. (Really, the title should probably have ""meteoroids"" plural. Crunchyroll wisely titles S1E13 as ""Meteoroids Falling, Burning, Disappearing, and Then..."".)</p>

<p>I'm not aware of this line actually being uttered anywhere in-universe. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the distance, that day, when the star became music...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a direct translation of 「遥か彼方　星が音楽となった…彼の日」, which is the first line of the second and seventh verses of ""Gyakkou no Flugel"", the Zwei Wing insert song from S1E01. </p>

<p>Naturally, this line is also part of the lyrics to ""Niji-iro no Flugel"", the reorchestrated version of ""Gyakkou no Flugel"" that was used as the ED for S2E13 and S3E13.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Believe in justice and hold a determination to fist.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is almost certainly an attempt at translating the title of Hibiki's first insert song from G, 「正義を信じて、握り締めて」 ""Seigi wo Shinjite, Nigirishimete"". A more natural translation would be something like ""Believe in justice and hold it tight"". I haven't the slightest idea how ""determination to fist"" came about, and I'm happy to award a bounty to anyone who comes up with a compelling explanation of how they bumbled their way into this translation.</p>

"<p>According to wiki there is a nice explanation about weakness of <a href=""http://onepiece.wikia.com/wiki/Devil_Fruit"" rel=""nofollow"">Devil fruit</a>. I would like to highlight few points which might help you.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Oda stated in an <a href=""http://onepiece.wikia.com/wiki/SBS"" rel=""nofollow"">SBS</a> that Devil Fruit users are susceptible to all
  types of water, not just seawater.</p>
  
  <p>This includes the white sea surrounding Skypiea. He elaborated on
  this, saying that ""moving"" water, like rain or waves, does not weaken
  Devil Fruit users, while standing water does. This was also shown
  first when Monkey D. Luffy was in the Dance-Powder induced rain and
  did not feel his power slipping away, and again when on Zou, the sea
  water that Zunisha used to shower did not affect him despite being sea
  water as it was ""moving"" water.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So the main conclusion which is given in wiki that:</p>

<p><strong>Devil Fruit user will not be restricted in the water if he or she is not physically touching the water.</strong></p>

<p>So according to me it might affect as long as devil fruit users are physically touching them.</p>

"<p>When Blackbeard touches a devil fruit user, it is as if they don't have powers. Unlike the sea, when he drains your power, even physical property changes to your body are cancelled out.</p>

<p>The <a href=""http://onepiece.wikia.com/wiki/Yami_Yami_no_Mi"" rel=""nofollow"">Wikia on Yami Yami no Mi</a> talks about this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This was shown when Luffy's stretching powers were canceled on touch, unlike the effect of a body of water or seastone, both of which just inhibit a person from controlling their powers. It was shown earlier when Luffy was stuck underwater that his neck could still be stretched above the water's surface, and that Busoushoku Haki would simply nullify the defensive aspects of a Devil Fruit such as intangibility and the malleability of rubber.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The episode they are talking about is episode 447. In this episode, Blackbeard uses vortex to pull in Luffy and smashes Luffy into the ground. Crocodile notes that there was blood. This is strange since Luffy, being rubber, should be immune to the physical damage caused by being slammed into the ground.</p>

<p>Another use of the Yami Yami no Mi allowed Blackbeard to permanently remove a devil fruit user's power and give it to himself. When Whitebeard died his power was still active in Blackbeard, thus causing the fruit to not regrow. This is proof of the permanent transference of power.</p>

<p>In either of these cases, either the case where the devil fruit user has their power drained temporarily by touch, or permanently like in the case of whitebeard, would the drained user regain their ability to swim?</p>

"<p>I haven't watched this show, but I used to be a linguistics nerd, and I'm highly skeptical of the claim that these chants are written in actual Sumerian. I think they're just a mishmash of English and English-looking nonsense.</p>

<p>(There is some argument on this point. Cuneiform is a mixed logographic/syllabic writing system—a little like Japanese, actually. Most sources state there were no initial consonant clusters, but <a href=""https://books.google.com/books?id=27JOMobauYAC&amp;pg=PA1046&amp;lpg=PA1046&amp;dq=sumerian+phonotactics&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=lUfPx8ALat&amp;sig=M1QWrppiLHSLLjK4Py4pBjc8gVw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiQve3R5pHNAhVMRVIKHe1ABtIQ6AEIITAB#v=onepage&amp;q=sumerian%20phonotactics&amp;f=false"" rel=""nofollow""><em>Encyclopedia of Linguistics</em></a> says that although the cuneiform system ""precludes the writing of initial and final consonantal clusters, it is quite likely that Sumerian did have them.""

</blockquote>

<p>Because Sumerian is incredibly ancient—it's the first known written language—and so much of it has come down to us through Akkadian scribes, who kept using it after it was dead because they thought it was cool, and because of the difficulties with the writing system that I alluded to above, there's a ton we don't know about it. No one believes the reconstructed phonology is 100% correct, or even 90% correct. But what we see here is too far off base to be taken seriously as an attempt to write Sumerian according to a reconstructed phonology.</p>

<h3>You can see where they cribbed from</h3>

<p>Whatever language this is, it includes the English words <em>various</em> and <em>coffin</em>, as well as <em>killter</em>, which looks a lot like <em>kilter</em>, as in ""off kilter"". The word <em>baral</em> in the swan song looks like it comes from Hebrew בלל (balal), which <a href=""http://biblehub.com/hebrew/1101.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">means ""to confuse"" or ""to mix""</a> and is <a href=""http://www.abarim-publications.com/Meaning/Babel.html#.V1SxLZPyuRs"" rel=""nofollow"">apparently the source of the word ""Babel""</a>. It uses the English form of <em>ziggurat</em>; the Akkadian form is <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ziggurat"" rel=""nofollow""><em>ziqqurat</em></a>, while ""ziggurat"" comes from the Hebrew form <a href=""https://glosbe.com/en/he/ziggurat"" rel=""nofollow"">זיגוראט (zygwrʼt)</a>. </p>

<p>That doesn't automatically disqualify it as a real language; after all, in the Australian language Mbabaram, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mbabaram_language#Word_for_.22dog.22"" rel=""nofollow""><em>dog</em> means ""dog""</a>. But, combined with the widespread use of English for mysterious and exotic things in anime, this makes me highly suspicious of any claim that the sentences are Sumerian or any other language. </p>

<p>Aside from that, the sentences conform remarkably well to English phonology. Almost all of these words are easily pronounceable to an English speaker. The ones that look a little weird, like <em>zeios</em> and <em>rei</em>, show some pretty clear Japanese influence. </p>

<h3>Machine systems can't make heads or tails of it</h3>

<p>I fed all the activation chants and the swan song to Google Translate and <a href=""http://labs.translated.net/language-identifier/"" rel=""nofollow"">Translated.net Labs's language detector</a>, both together and individually. I wasn't expecting it to translate them, but I was hoping it would detect what language they were.</p>

<p>As a side note, machine translation still sucks, but this kind of language detection is supposed to be pretty good; Russel and Norvig claim in <em>Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach</em> that computer systems can identify languages, even based on short texts like ""Hello world"" and ""Wie geht es dir"", with greater than 99% accuracy (<em>AIMA</em> 3ed., page 862). </p>

<p>None of these systems can detect Sumerian or Akkadian, but they can detect most modern languages, even some quite obscure ones. The general consensus was that the activation chants have a Germanic flavor (Google Translate pegged them as English, even after I deleted the words <em>various</em> and <em>coffin</em>, while another service took them as Frisian, a Germanic language closely related to English), while the swan song was taken as Indonesian. Google Translate insisted that both texts together were English, while Translated.net took both texts together as <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sundanese_language"" rel=""nofollow"">Sundanese</a>. </p>

<p>For comparison, I took a passage from Shakespeare's <em>Titus Andronicus</em> and a few lines from The Who's ""Call Me Lighting"", shoved them together, and fed them to Translated.net:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>so, so; now sit: and look you eat no more
  than will preserve just so much strength in us
  as will revenge these bitter woes of ours.
  marcus, unknit that sorrow-wreathen knot:
  thy niece and i, poor creatures, want our hands,
  and cannot passionate our tenfold grief
  with folded arms. this poor right hand of mine
  is left to tyrannize upon my breast;
  who, when my heart, all mad with misery,
  beats in this hollow prison of my flesh,
  then thus i thump it down.  </p>
  
  <p>hey little girl who's dancing so lightly,  my xke is shining so brightly,  the noose around us is slowly tightening,  i'm gonna show you why they call me lightning</p>
</blockquote>

<p>English, English, and more English. It defies my suspension of disbelief to think that if these passages were all the same language, there would be so much confusion about what language that was. </p>

<p>I have no idea what algorithm Google Translate uses; Translated.net seems to use some kind of nearest neighbors algorithm.</p>

<h3>The ""translations"" are absurd</h3>

<p>The translation of Ichaival's chant seems to have been removed from the wikia sometime between when this question was asked and now, which probably doesn't say much for its authenticity. But let's take a look at the one in the OP:</p>

<p><em>Killter ichaival tron</em> -> Evening draws in the awakened Ichaival</p>

<p>Since all the chants end with <em>tron</em>, that has to be something that makes sense in every chant. Based on the context, I'm going to say that has to be ""awakened""; it <em>is</em> an activation song, so it makes sense that they would all be ""awakened"". So <em>Ichaival tron</em> means ""awakened Ichaival"". So we can postulate that this language puts modifiers after nouns, like Spanish and Irish.</p>

<p>Then what does <em>killter</em> mean? It has to mean <em>evening draws in</em>. But this is linguistically absurd; it violates <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constituent_(linguistics)"" rel=""nofollow"">constituent structure</a>. <em>draws in</em> is a verb, while <em>evening</em> is a noun. <em>killter</em> can't literally mean <em>evening draws in</em> in a real language (if it does, we've got the makings of a real whopper of a paper in theoretical syntax here—it'll be almost to theoretical syntax what those particles that traveled faster than light would have been to relativity). </p>

<p><em>killter</em> therefore must mean either <em>evening</em> or <em>draws in</em>, with the other element implied or indicated in some way by the morphology. So we have a language where you can just say <em>draws in</em>, and everyone automatically assumes you meant <em>evening draws in</em>, or a language where you can just say <em>evening</em>, and everyone assumes you meant <em>evening draws in</em>. Some languages, at least in their poetry, do allow you to get incredibly terse like this. Still...I'm not buying it. It reminds me too much of <a href=""http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/auldelv.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">Helge K Fauskanger's analysis of Auld Elvish from <em>Bored of the Rings</em></a>. </p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>I'm not convinced these are passages from a real language, or even from a somewhat sensible conlang like the <a href=""http://conlang.wikia.com/wiki/Hymmnos"" rel=""nofollow"">Hymnos language</a> from the <em>Ar Tonelico</em> series. All my instincts are telling me they're just gibberish courtesy of the people who gave us <a href=""http://anime.stackexchange.com/q/32546/7579"">a determination to fist</a>. I wish I knew where the ""translations"" came from or why they spread around the online anime community, a community generally obsessed with the minutiae of dead languages, which <a href=""http://wiki.puella-magi.net/Deciphering_the_runes#Trivia"" rel=""nofollow"">surprised the Japanese production staff of Madoka</a> with its determination to translate the runes. </p>
"
"<p>Inspired by <a href=""http://anime.stackexchange.com/a/33555/"">Evilloli's excellent answer</a>, I decided to figure out where these ""translations"" came from. </p>

<hr>

<p>After clicking through a lot of diffs on the Symphogear wikia, I was able to trace most of the ""translations"" back to <a href=""http://symphogear.wikia.com/wiki/Message_Wall:Kanade2000"" rel=""nofollow"">wikia user Kanade2000</a> - diffs: <a href=""http://symphogear.wikia.com/wiki/Ichaival?diff=8056&amp;oldid=8055"" rel=""nofollow"">Ichaival</a>, <a href=""http://symphogear.wikia.com/wiki/Ame_no_Habakiri?diff=prev&amp;oldid=8054"" rel=""nofollow"">Ame-no-Habakiri</a>, <a href=""http://symphogear.wikia.com/wiki/Gungnir?diff=prev&amp;oldid=8060"" rel=""nofollow"">Gungnir</a>. When asked <a href=""http://symphogear.wikia.com/wiki/Thread:3283"" rel=""nofollow"">""I couldn't help but notice you post the translations for the Transformation lyrics and the Zessho. If you could, could you tell me how you translated them?""</a>, the user replied ""using old norse dictionary that I found in my city library.i also have a skandinavian one and a latin one"". </p>

<p>This answer does not inspire confidence in the user's linguistic faculties, particularly when you notice that the same user <a href=""http://symphogear.wikia.com/wiki/Thread:3821"" rel=""nofollow"">also tried to change the romanization of 絶刀 <em>zettou</em> to ""zetsukatana""</a> (only a rank amateur would consider combining the <em>on</em>-reading <em>zetsu</em> with the <em>kun</em>-reading <em>katana</em>).</p>

<p>These, I think, we can chalk up to a buffoon on the internet.</p>

<hr>

<p><a href=""http://symphogear.wikia.com/wiki/Zesshou?diff=8328&amp;oldid=8090"" rel=""nofollow"">The translation for the Zesshou</a>, however, comes from <a href=""http://symphogear.wikia.com/wiki/User:Sylphfarn12"" rel=""nofollow"">wikia user Sylphfarn12</a> , and linked <a href=""http://www.symphogear-g.com/introduction/keyword_24.php"" rel=""nofollow"">G keyword 24</a> (絶唱 ""Zesshou"") as a reference. However, nothing in the text of the keyword page has anything to do with the actual text of the Zesshou. I have no idea how this user came up with their ""translation"". Buffoonery seems likely.</p>

<p>(A different buffoon in the comments of the page indicates - with a startling degree of confidence - that <a href=""http://symphogear.wikia.com/wiki/Zesshou#comm-4290"" rel=""nofollow"">""Its Basque or Malay can't remember which""</a>. Another user <a href=""http://symphogear.wikia.com/wiki/Zesshou#comm-4299"" rel=""nofollow"">rules out Malay in a reply</a>. So it must be Basque, right? Mission Accomplished!)</p>

<p>What is she talking about? Why did she do this?</p>
"
"<p>In Japan, the color schemes used by license plates are standardized at a national level. Plates with black text on a yellow background are used for ""light vehicles"" (sometimes glossed in English as ""<em>kei</em> car"" from 軽 <em>kei</em> ""light""). For example:</p>

<p><a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/sCgVu.png"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/sCgVu.png"" alt=""a light vehicle&#39;s license plate""></a></p>

<p>A three- or four-wheeled vehicle is deemed a ""light vehicle"" if its engine displacement is 660 cc or less and meets a few size and weight restrictions. </p>

<p>I don't know much about cars, but it seems that 660 cc is quite small. The five <a href=""http://www.goodcarbadcar.net/2016/02/usa-best-selling-cars-january-2016-sales-figures.html"" rel=""nofollow"">top-selling cars in the U.S. as of January 2016</a> were the Toyota Camry (2500+ cc), Honda Civic (1500+ cc), Toyota Corolla (1800+ cc), Nissan Altima (2500+ cc), and Honda Accord (2400+ cc). And these are all reasonably-sized sedans, not Hummer-esque monstrosities (6000+ cc). </p>

<p>These cars are fairly popular in Japan (<a href=""http://www.zenkeijikyo.or.jp/statistics/ken_share/1503ken_share4.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">as of Mar 2015</a>, 39% of all vehicles in Japan were light vehicles; this is up from 26% <a href=""http://www.zenkeijikyo.or.jp/statistics/ken_share/9803ken_share4.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">in 1998</a>), for reasons apparently having to do with how Japan taxes and regulates vehicles. They also sell reasonably well in South/Southeast Asia. </p>

<p>I would agree with Nori that light vehicles are conservative, primarily because they're often <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=%E8%BB%BD%E8%87%AA%E5%8B%95%E8%BB%8A&amp;tbm=isch"" rel=""nofollow"">rather boxy and unattractive</a> (because of the size restrictions) and because they accelerate slowly and generally have poor ""performance"" (because of the small engine). They seem to have many benefits, especially in urban environments (easier parking and maneuvering; lower taxes and cheaper insurance; better gas mileage; and apparently <a href=""https://www.kuruvia.com/articles/knowledges/17/"" rel=""nofollow"">there's less bureaucracy involved in registering one</a>). But you're not going to impress almost anyone with a light vehicle.</p>

<p>To do this Light had to have a second Death Note on him as he gives up ownership of his in order to retain his memories and claim ownership of the new Death Note when it's ownership is given up by one of the Shinigami. his new one he can give up ownership when he wanted to ""get rid of this pride"" while in imprisoned (ie. get rid of ownership and erasing his memories).</p>

<p>Now it was important for Rem to be the Shinigami of this Death Note that L recovered because if Rem didn't play along Misa's life would be in danger as such the fake rules wouldn't be exposed. Of course Light knew L well enough that L would still pursue Misa and seeking her execution by proving she was the Second Kira, forcing Rem's hand to then kill L.

"<p>I've been looking into this and i do consider it feasible, the retraction system checks out but some issues i have thought of (and are pretty obvious) are that it would be very heavy with the compressed gas on you,(practical use you wouldn't need the sheath or the blades cause titans don't exist). To shoot a hook out with just compressed gas you wouldn't get very far especially if its steel you would have to use something a lot lighter like carbon fiber. (i hadn't thought of pistons till i read one of these answers though). how much gas you can release out of the pressure tanks at once is pretty small with current technology so you couldn't get much of a boost from it but if you found a way to release gas faster without blowing yourself up then that would solve a lot of problems.</p>

"<p>You have already linked the entirety of the evidence for and against their relationship. As of right now in the manga, it is Hinted that they are related, but nothing has actually been said. There does seem to be a resemblance between Eleen and Erza, the power and hair, as well as looks, but that one panel you linked where Neinhart noted these things is all we have to go on.

"<p>What is the process of getting an anime for example onto CrunchyRoll? Let's say a new original anime airs in Japan and a lot of the viewers on the west want to watch it too.

"<p>Okay, I pretty much get how Demon Weapons and Death Scythes work. I get how Kishin's work too. However, on the Wiki, it says that the process of becoming a Kishin is ""initially exclusive to Demon Weapons"" and requires the ""merging between a non-Demon Weapon and a Demon Weapon"", which would be a Demon Weapon eating Kishin Eggs (or souls not on the Shimigami's list). </p>

<p>Basically, you need a Demon Sword before you can have a Kishin. </p>

<p>We know that Asura <em>ate</em> his Demon Sword and became a Kishin so my question is this: who exactly is able to become a Kishin? What would've happened is Asura's Demon Sword continued to eat human souls? Although it was never mentioned or seen in the Soul Eater universe, could a Demon Weapon/Demon Sword--perfectly capable of killing and eating by themselves-- become a Kishin without a meister?</p>

"<p>Well Kakashi was making a rough estamite when comparing narutos chakra to his own.  First of all by part 2 im pretty sure kakashis chakra pool had grown to the point that he could make 6 lightning blades each day or a little more.  Plus rasengan was never said to take up a lot of chakra.  Giant rasengan was stated to take up more chakra because of its density so i think a lightning blade could be comparable to a giant rasengan.  But even then naruto clearlly has for than 4 times kakashis chakra.  He has made dozens of clones and each could have done multiple rasengans.  Plus by the time naruto learns sage mode naruto could have done around 6 rasenshurikens with other rasengan variats and still not seem to have any noticable chakra fatigue.  I would say narutos chakra reserve is at least 6-8 times that of kakashis for him to be able to do so many rasenshurikens when the take up a lot more chakra than a lightning blade.</p>

"<p><strong>The Programmer is an unknown student from the anime <em>Angel Beats</em>.</strong> He is revealed to exist when Yuri, the leader of the SSS,</p>

<p><strong>The Programmer is widely credited with having created:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>the Angel Player program</li>
<li>The AI</li>
<li>The Shadows</li>
</ul>

<p>It is likely that he created the Angel Player program, as it existed before Kanade Tachibana entered the Afterlife.</p>

<p>It's almost certain that the AI was made by the Programmer, when he states that he is <em>""simply obeying the rules""</em> when asked what he is doing with the computers from PC Room 1.</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Yui disappeared,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The AI would have activated the Shadow program, <strong>also manufactured by the Programmer,</strong> to begin wiping out the SSS, Guild, and NPCs.</p>

<p>Now, the Programmer's background is one of mystery. It's a long story, so I'm going to take a leaf out of the <a href=""http://angelbeats.wikia.com/wiki/The_Programmer"" rel=""nofollow"">Wikia's book</a> here (with some minor edits).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Programmer's real name is unknown. But like Otonashi, he was never supposed to have entered the Afterlife, but somehow ended up there anyway.</p>
  
  <p>During his time in the Afterlife School, he fell in love with an unnamed girl who disappeared when her regret was fulfilled. Unwilling or unable to accept that, he decided to wait for her to return, which from the Afterlife School rules would require her to:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Die during her teenage years (13 to 17 or so for a 4 year gap)</li>
  <li>Have a heavy regret</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p><strong>If the girl lived an average of 85 years and reincarnated each time, there would be a 4/85 (teenage years)*9.83/1000(Japan death rate )*1%(Ad hoc chance of heavy regret)=~0.0004% every reincarnation. Each failure to hit this chance would lead to 85 years of waiting. A 10% chance to see her again would require 2.125 million years.</strong> </p>
  
  <p><em>The above calculations do not consider that the majority of the death rate is actually from the elderly rather than from teenagers.</em></p>
  
  <p>As expected, the amount stunned Yuri, due to the massive time required to be spent waiting. The AI explained that The Programmer lost his grip on sanity after waiting so long, and decided to create a program to turn himself into an NPC.</p>
  
  <p>As The Programmer felt that people who had resolved their sadness should not clutter the Afterlife School (much like patients should be discharged when they are cured rather than staying in the hospital), he created a program that kept track of the amount of love in the Afterlife School world. <strong>When the amount of love exceeded a certain amount, a ""cleaning"" program would be activated where NPCs would be changed into Shadows, which would in turn target humans and forcibly change them into NPCs, thus resetting the world into one where no humans existed.</strong></p>

"<p>In very first of episode, Luffy said that 10 peoples are enough for his crew.
But I'm little curious, by 10 he mean, is 10 including himself or 10 other peoples on the ship plus Luffy?</p>

<p>I've read somewhere (I can't remember where I read, or even this is true or not) that Oda have stated the next crew is some kind ""old enemy"" of Luffy.
I don't think that Jinbei is the person that Oda said because he is not an enemy for Luffy at all (Once again I don't even know that Oda really said that old enemy thing).</p>

<p>So, I just want to know if Oda really said something about that old enemy of Luffy, and if so did Oda also stated about Straw Hat crew members are 10 including Luffy or not?</p>
"
"<p>I don't quite understand the point of such questions. Its clearly never been made clear the extent of BB's powers. (Logia intangibility, Removing other DF's powers etc. etc.) Unless Oda decided to make this a plot point somewhere down the line, I wouldn't really care how the DF mechanics work for the Yami Yami no Mi. But fans are really passionate about it So here's my answer. There is no real point in it.</p>

<p>It is shown quite clearly that BB needs to be touching the user to negate the DF powers (Whitebeard and Ace fights). So in order for a DF user to swim, </p>

<ol>
<li>BB sits in a boat, holds one arm or touches the body of DF user. The boat has to follow the same exact path and speed of the swimmer and the instant BB loses the touch DF user drowns and BB can't save him. Unless the boat can just have 1 pirate on it, I'd rather just row.</li>
<li>BB himself can't swim being a DF user. He will lose strength and from what I know the Yami Yami no Mi power is not auto triggered.</li>
</ol>

<p>Thus only plausible scenario is</p>

<ol start=""3"">
<li>That BB can maintain his DF fruit power even when he is submerged in water, and then a DF fruit user can carry him across water.</li>
</ol>

<p>I think 3 is improbable since Crocodile did say that he has trained himself to turn into sand. Similarly BB needs to concentrate to hold his DF power and wouldn't be able to do so if submerged. Thus this power is imho inconsequential.</p>
"
"<p>I don't think that Blackbeard can remove the power of Devil Fruit permanently and the victim can't regain the ability to swim.</p>

<p>Just like stated <a href=""http://onepiece.wikia.com/wiki/Yami_Yami_no_Mi"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The most unique and frightening advantage of the fruit is that <strong>the
  user also has the ability to <em>nullify the powers of other Devil Fruits
  by simply touching the user and draining them of their abilities</em>.</strong>
  All types of Devil Fruit, be it a Paramecia, Zoan or Logia, are
  affected by this, though Logias are most affected as they can no
  longer become intangible by transforming into their respective
  element.  This nullification truly seems absolute, as though the Devil
  Fruit users had never gained their powers at all.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And also this <a href=""http://onepiece.wikia.com/wiki/Yami_Yami_no_Mi#Weaknesses"" rel=""nofollow"">part</a> stated that Blackbeard can nullify the power of other Devil Fruit users if he touch them. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In addition, while the ability to nullify Devil Fruit abilities is
  very powerful, 
  <strong>the user must actually touch and remain in contact with the victim for the effects to remain constant, meaning that <em>if the victim is
  somehow separated from the user's physical touch they will quickly
  regain their Devil Fruit abilities</em>.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, the victims can't regain their ability to swim if Blackbeard doesn't touch them to nullify their Devil Fruit power.</p>

<p>They can probably, swimming by carrying Blackbeard on their back.</p>

"<p>What the initial quote was ""about 10 people"" so there is no hard and fast rule regarding the final size of Straw Hat Crew. 
I'd like the theory of 4 more people joining. 4 (Zoro, Usopp, Sanji, Nami joined in East Blue), + 4 (Chopper, Franky, Robin and Brook) in the first half of grand line</p>

<p>Among the next 4 I am thinking Jinbei is a given. That makes 10 but I'd like to think some other allies such as Caesar, Vegapunk etc. may also join. There is this really vast theory about the following members joining which draws parallels between the previous joinees and the future recruits</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Jinbei, Smoker, Unknown Warrior probably from Elbaf and Tashigi. I liked it especially since it filled the ""old enemy Smoker"" and another female recruit as well as a fishman. I also agree with the theory that Luffy's garp is Coby. </p>

<p>About Oda's quote, Unconfirmed rumours are floating around for ages. Next recruit is an old enemy, next recruit would be a female (Cue why people wanted Monet with Logia powers or Baby5) etc. etc.</p>

They both are rival of each other, Ursula taunts Dawn in that episode; they both have taken part in a Pokemon contest. Since I am not a native speaker I could not understand what they actually spoke. The conversation was much like this -:</p>

<p><strong>Ursula:</strong> <em>Maye! Maye! But you know it isn't sweet as little Dawn.</em></p>

<p><strong>Dawn:</strong> <em>Ursula</em>.</p>

"<p>This is the explanation given by Hiroki Chiba (Scenario Writer) for the phrase:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The number ""9"" is the last single-digit number so it symbolizes the
  “end”. The phrase is a unique abstract mythological expression which
  means the end of 3 signifies the end of the world (collapse of the
  cycle of death and rebirth). The unification of Orience, the end of 3
  countries, is one of the things that 9 and 9 and 9 implies.</p>

<p>The only thing I know, is that they can grow in any weather condition, necause when Luffy meets chopper, he already has devil fruit abilities, but he never left the Drum island in his life.</p>
"
"<p>Devil fruits do not actually grow on trees. They are just normal fruits infused with a Devil fruit power. Based on its <a href=""http://onepiece.wikia.com/wiki/Devil_Fruit"" rel=""nofollow"">wikia page</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When a Devil Fruit user dies, their ability is reborn into another fruit of the same kind. Instead of growing from a plant, the ability simply regenerates inside another existing fruit, as seen when Smiley ""died"" and the Sara Sara no Mi, Model: Axolotl transplanted itself into a nearby apple. Another characteristic of a Devil Fruit's growth is that the stem becomes noticeably curlier than it was when the fruit was not endowed with the ability.</p>

<p>As stated, the only time we have seen such a process happen is in Chapter 676:</p>

"<p>In Episodes 4 and 6 we find out about the history between Utaha and Tomoya. Tomoya was a superfan of Utaha's book series, and wrote a ton of praise for it on his blog. Utaha was impressed with how thorough his knowledge of her books was, and developed tremendous respect for his opinion, to the point that she tried to give him her unfinished draft. He refused on principle, which led her to <a href=""http://anime.stackexchange.com/q/19170/7579"">start calling him ""Rinri-kun""</a>.</p>

<p>As she developed respect for Tomoya, Utaha's feelings also deepened into something like love. She often seems unsure herself whether she loves him, though, and possibly she's afraid of being rejected as she was when she asked him for feedback on her partially finished novel, so she always makes light of it and flirts with him playfully so she can back out if she needs to. The <a href=""http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2016-03-17/saekano-tv-anime-sequel-to-premiere-on-noitamina-in-april-2017/.99908"" rel=""nofollow"">upcoming sequel</a> will probably expand on Utaha and Tomoya's relationship.</p>
"
"<p>From the wording of the rules of deathnote and the way the ""eyes of Shinigami"" are explained in the anime this scenario seems plausible. </p>

<p>However, as I've said many times in such questions this is meaningless speculation since either scenario is plausible and the rules of DN leave room for speculation. So other than just saying this scenario is possible and saying that some of our better fanfic writers picking this up as a possible plot point Idk what else to add.</p>

<p>However, to add to the ""suspicion"" on a blind man scenario. There are many ways this would be a bad idea. </p>

<ul>
<li>Suddenly a blind person is cured. Publicity, DN user is exposed. Someone else may have seen them together</li>
<li>It is not so easy to hide that you are not blind. Plenty of involuntary actions, such as dodging, moving hands etc give away the fact you're not blind. It would be much tougher for a blind person who has healed to hide these signs.</li>
</ul>

<p>So on surface it may seem a good idea, but it has its own pitfalls, pros and cons just as another. Also the blind person will lose his sight the moment he gives up ownership of the DN. I would like to think that the KIRA will kill to get the Notebook back.</p>

"<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_Hunter"" rel=""nofollow""><em>City Hunter</em> on Wikipedia</a> says there are 35 Volumes to the series originally running in Japan from 1985 to 1991/1992. </p>

<p>on the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_City_Hunter_chapters"" rel=""nofollow"">List of Chapters</a> the final volume came out in April 1992 however chapter information stops at Volume 26 with Chapter 137 saying <em>""(incomplete)""</em> and with the inconsistent number of chapters per volume it's hard to extrapolate how many chapters there was by Volume 35. this relates to the Japanese release</p>

<p>the English Release appears to have more chapters per volume with Volume 5 ending at <em>Chapter 44 - Gambling Queen</em>, however judging by the names of chapters in the English version it appears some of the Japanese Chapters were split, such as <em>Volume 4: Chapter 15 - A Lame Teacher</em> in the Japanese version appears to match with the English Version's <em>Chapters 29-31 - The Wacky Professor Part 1-3</em>. As there are no ISBN numbers for the English Version after Volume 5 one can assume there are no Legal English versions released beyond Volume 5.</p>

<p>On <em>City Hunter's</em> Wikipedia Page, inside the right side info box under English publisher it says</p>

<blockquote>

<p>looking at <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gutsoon!_Entertainment"" rel=""nofollow"">Gutsoon! Entertainment's Wikipedia Page</a> it says</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>On March 15, 2004, Gutsoon! announced that they will be placing their Rajin Comics brand on hiatus. <strong>Raijin Comics ceased publication with its July 2004 issue (issue #46) and the Raijin Graphic Novels line was subsequently cancelled as well.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>this is also confirmed on <em>City Hunter's</em> Wikipedia Page</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Attempts were made to license the series for the American comic market during the 1980s; however, Hojo insisted the manga should be released in the right-to-left format. In 2002 Coamix created an American subsidiary, Gutsoon! Entertainment. City Hunter was a flagship title in their Raijin Comics Anthology. Raijin switched from a weekly format to a monthly format before being cancelled after 46 issues.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In these magazine serializations in Japan a Manga Series is generally released a chapter at a time in each issue so the 44 Chapters of the English Version run close to the 46 Issues of <em>Raijin Comics</em></p>

<p>As for other countries there doesn't seem to be any data for their release however the Wikipedia page may only be detailing the original Japanese release and English because it itself is in English as <a href=""https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/manga.php?id=1593"" rel=""nofollow"">Anime News Network</a> list other countries that the manga series has been published in, however as i don't know any other languages getting data from another Language's Wikipedia will be a bit harder.</p>

<p>From the data we have on Wikipedia for <em>City Hunter</em> we can say that only up to <em>Volume 5: Chapter 22 - The Game's Queen</em> was officially localized in English as <em>Chapter 44 - Gambling Queen</em>. any other chapters in english that are floating around on the internet i would suspect to be scanlations. </p>

<p>scanlation status is not on topic here on Anime and Manga as such you probably wont find any information here as to any announcement by the scanlation circle why they have stopped, however possible reasons could be due to </p>

<ul>
<li>Lack of access to the Raw Japanese Manga</li>
<li>Lack of Staff (scanlation circles shouldn't be profiting so the staff only works when they have the time)</li>
<li>Being told to stop by the publishers/mangaka (has happened if i recall, just not sure on the title) </li>
<li>Just a lack of interest in the series, this can be combined with Lack of Staff as Staff can leave individually when they lack interest. </li>

"<p>From the first episode of Gochuumon wa Usagi desuka? (Is the order a rabbit?) Chino's grandfather was depicted as a rabbit (very questionable since he didn't look like a rabbit, but the anime says so, so let's call him a rabbit). However, considering that both Chino's father and Chino is a normal human, and that the writer who often come to Chino's cafe (Rabbit House) used to have talks with the first owner (Chino's grandfather), there must be a time where he was a normal human. Otherwise, the writer lady would have noticed it was him when she saw the rabbit. Also since the rabbit has no arms (at least the first season doesn't show it to have arms), and considering his size, he wouldn't be able to pour coffee.

<p>One of these characters a Chinese male named Lau is responsible for oversight of the drug trafficking that occurs in London. </p>

<p>Ciel being the Earl of Phantomhive, received a mission from the queen to eliminate a rat who had been messing with Lau's business. </p>

<p>Lau gave Ciel the key who baited out his kidnapping and flushed out the rat. Which is why the main focus in the point of this episode was that Ciel likes to play games.

"<p>No, considering that one would be talking about Blue from either Pokémon Special, the games, or Pokémon Origin.
 Gary is also a name you can choose for your rival in the games, making the gameverse Blue/Gary comparison irrelevant, due to the fact that it is one's own choice.
 Gary is mainly known from originating from the anime as Ash's arrogant rival, accompanied by fangirls and cheerleaders.
 Blue, or Green in Japan, from Pokémon Special/Adventures is the more mature, and serious counterpart to Gary and Blue from the anime and games respectfully. He is Red's rival in the manga, and is considered by Red himself to be a rather powerful trainer.
 Blue from Pokémon Origins would also be rather irrelevant, since Pokémon Origins is based strictly off of the events in the games.</p>

"<p>Like other characters Cave is a personification of a company, in this case <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cave_(company)"" rel=""nofollow"">CAVE Interactive Co., Ltd</a> or just CAVE (Computer Art Visual Entertainment).</p>

<p>in Danmaku games the player normally has a very small hitbox which allows them to squeeze though the tiniest of gaps in the bullet curtain. Cave's mention of her hitbox and her nimble abilities getting through the crowd is a reference to here where the people of the crowd are like the bullets of a bullet curtain.</p>

<p>it's also worth noting that infact it was CAVE which ended up inventing these kind of games from an initial prototype template that initial template that was created by another company that some of CAVE's employees had came from.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Toaplan's Batsugun (1993) provided the prototypical template for this new breed, with Cave (formed by former employees of Toaplan, including Batsugun's main creator Tsuneki Ikeda, after the latter company collapsed) inventing the type proper with 1995's DonPachi</p>

"<p>Fact 1: Death Note exists.</p>

<p>Fact 2: Mikami wrote Kiyomi's name.</p>

<p>Fact 3: Kiyomi died.</p>

<p>Fact 4: There are more than 1 Kira.</p>

<p>Fact 5: First Kira was a student.</p>

<p>Fact 6: First Kira lived in Kanto area.</p>

<p>Fact 7: Light lived in Kanto area and was a student when Kira first surfaced.</p>

<p>Fact 8: The Kiras are working together.</p>

<p>Was Light Kira? Possibly yes considering the facts above.</p>

<p>Is it definite that Light was Kira? No. It could have been another student and it was Mikami who wrote the Kiyomi's name (IIRC piece of death note Light used to write Kiyomi's name was never discovered). </p>

<p>Fact 9: Light said, ""victory is mine"".</p>

<p>Fact 10: Light's name is the only one not written on the Death Note by Mikami Teru.</p>

<p>Fact 11: Mikami Teru has the Shinigami Eyes.</p>

<p>Fact 12: Mikami Teru called Light ""God"".</p>

<p>Is Light Kira? Yes, definitely.</p>

<p>So, it's not directly because Takada Kiyomi's name is in Teru's Death Note. It's because Mikami called Light ""God"" and Light's name being the only one not written in the Death Note.</p>

<p><a href=""http://deathnote.wikia.com/wiki/Kiyomi_Takada#Plot"" rel=""nofollow"">Takada Kiyomi's wikia entry</a> said that</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Kiyomi is forced to commit suicide by fire (presumably using the fuel
  in Mello's motorcycle and equipment), burning herself, Mello's body,
  her belongings, and everything around her.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is exactly like what was written by Mikami Teru in Death Note hold. This means that Mikami Teru has the same power as Kira and can be considered as one. Whether Light wrote Kiyomi's name in his own Death Note or not does not matter, because it is <a href=""http://www.practicalhomicide.com/Research/LOmar2007.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">impossible to determine time of death down to the minutes unless you are there at the scene</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>However, it is utterly impossible to fix the exact hour and minute
  that life ceased unless you were there at the moment of death.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What matters is that Mikami Teru wrote Kiyomi's death and cause of death and it conforms to the her death. Mikami also write down the names of those in the warehouse, all except Light's name. Why would a Kira let one person stay alive? Because that one person is also a Kira, which is confirmed by Mikami calling Light ""God""</p>

"<p>Recently finished this and what i got after thinking about it for a while was that Satoshi, lied about the paper being his sisters. If you go back and check, his sister didn't even participate in the ritual. And i thought that it was pretty weird that Satoshi gave Naomi his own paper instead of just giving her the extra charm. So i thought about it and the only explanation that makes sense is that Satoshi lied in order to bring Naomi Nakashima back safely while knowingly putting himself in jeopardy. Satoshi gave Naomi his own charm to bring her back safely but maybe it wasn't such a selfless motive. He knew he couldn't live on in the real world again with the memory of his tortured little sister dying in his arms after stupidity leaving her behind alone with the girl with the red dress. We all saw the effect all of these memories had with Naomi, after she survived, she basically went insane. (Note: In the Corpse Party game it's revealed that anyone that dies in the elementary school, memories of them are completely wiped out in the real world having them be completely forgotten by their loved ones) Also worthy of noting, the ending when Naomi's mom is talking to her doctor about how Naomi keeps talking about ""her friend"" and how ""she"" doesn't exist brings us back to the scene of Naomi killing her best friend (Seiko Shinohara) while seemingly possessed.  For Naomi, being one of the only survivors in her group of friends, and not to mention killing and watching her her best friend die drove her to insanity.</p>

"<p>Ciel Phantomhive's noble title was Earl. In medieval England, an <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earl"" rel=""nofollow"">Earl is the same as a Count in other parts of Europe</a>.

<p>My question is, since Phantomhive is his family name and not a name of a region in England (except if in Kuroshitsuji universe there is a region named Phantomhive, but I never heard of that), what region/county in England Ciel's Earl title governs over?</p>

"<h2>Here are a few possible candidates.</h2>

<h3>1. Yuzuru Otonashi</h3>

<p><a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/fxDpK.jpg"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/fxDpK.jpg"" alt=""Otonashi""></a></p>

<p>The <a href=""http://angelbeats.wikia.com/wiki/The_Programmer"" rel=""nofollow"">Programmer's</a> details match those of <a href=""http://angelbeats.wikia.com/wiki/Yuzuru_Otonashi"" rel=""nofollow"">Yuzuru Otonashi's</a> with striking similarities. Let's not forget that alongside the original ending of Angel Beats, Key issued another epilogue, aptly titled ""Another Epilogue"". In this, the main focus is another person that's arrived in the Afterlife, and he is surrounded by quiet, obedient NPCs. After challenging the reality of the Afterlife School, he is talked to by the Student Council President,</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> The Otonashi in an alternate timeline, who hasn't moved on yet,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and he is told that if he has any questions about the world that they both live in that he should come down to the Student Council room. However, as</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Otonashi heads back to the Student Council room, a girl can be heard saying, ""There's a rumor that he's waiting for someone.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So therefore, it's entirely possible that</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Otonashi is waiting for Kanade, and that this timestream somehow loops. Otonashi goes crazy waiting for Kanade, who has a infinitesimally small chance of reappearing in the Afterlife, but still, better than zero. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>He turns himself into an NPC to be able to withstand the long wait, and creates the AI, or the ""AI"" to be able to maintain the requirements of the Afterlife, not allowing love to manifest, possibly therefore saving future arrivals from the pain that he has been exposed to. This may be why he creates <a href=""http://angelbeats.wikia.com/wiki/Angel_Player"" rel=""nofollow"">Angelplayer</a>, because he knows that if Kanade reappears, then she'll know how to use it, any maybe program it to move him back from his NPC state. The members of the SSS arrive after this, then, at the time of Episode 1, the timestream loops, causing </p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Otonashi to revert back from an NPC. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Forgetting everything that's happened to him, the events continue their course the same way they did before – </p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">

<h3>2. Tachibana Kanade</h3>

<p><a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/NRuxi.png"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/NRuxi.png"" alt=""Kanade""></a></p>

<p><a href=""http://angelbeats.wikia.com/wiki/Kanade_Tachibana"" rel=""nofollow"">Tachibana Kanade</a> was one of the first people to appear in the Afterlife World, and also the only person who is able to use Angelplayer without help. Because she has this ability, she may be the one who programmed it. However, she has never expressed any recollection in creating the program.</p>

<h3>3. Takeyama</h3>

<p><a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/n0cgq.jpg"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/n0cgq.jpg"" alt=""Takeyama""></a></p>

<p><a href=""http://angelbeats.wikia.com/wiki/Takeyama"" rel=""nofollow"">Takeyama</a> is great with computers. His behavior throughout the anime is somewhat mysterious, as he constantly refers to himself as ""Christ"", suggesting that he has some great power in the Afterlife World. He is the most logical choice because of his skill with computers, and his ability to interface with Angelplayer. However, he does require English translators to use the program.</p>

<h3>4. ???</h3>

<p><a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/eo6qN.jpg"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/eo6qN.jpg"" alt=""&quot;You wouldn&#39;t know, even if I told you.&quot;""></a></p>

<p>The AI tells <a href=""http://angelbeats.wikia.com/wiki/Yuri_Nakamura"" rel=""nofollow"">Yuri</a> that the Programmer existed before the SSS appeared, and turned himself into an NPC. The AI also tells Yuri that she wouldn't know the Programmer even if the AI were to say it. This, logically, means that the Programmer cannot be a member of the SSS, Guild, or Kanade, as Yuri knows all of these people. Or, the AI could just have been made to respond that way to protect the Programmer. Perhaps we may never know...</p>

<p>How is this game supposed to work? According to Hane, ""whoever has the most wins"". The most what? It looks like ""the most people writing the same character"". But then why does Hijiri win, and not Raimu, who wrote the same character? (Aside from the reason that it's hard to organize a race when you can only communicate by writing on a notebook and no one officially recognizes your existence.)</p>

Initially I thought the characters were limited to days of the week, but Rin picked 銀 (silver), which isn't a day of the week.</p>

<p>Since Hane mentions that Onsa invented this game, I assume it isn't a real game, but maybe it's based on something, or was explained more fully in the manga.</p>

"<p>How do the death scythes work? I know the reapers use them to view cinematic records of a person's life to decide whether they are to die or not (I assume as in if the person gets in an accident, for example, the reaper uses the scythe and makes the decision). </p>

<p>But, the scythes must also have the ability to be used as any other weapon. Grell uses his to kill Madame Red and attack Sebastian.</p>
"
"<p>Death scythes from my understanding have the function of removing ones soul or essence of existence. Doing so conventionally kills the victim. </p>

<p>It should not be used in any other way than reaping people from the list. But Grell in particular is not a shinigami that follows the rules as he steps out often on a whim for adventure and excitement. </p>

<p>This is shown in several points in the jack the ripper arc in which case he is immediately brought back to HQ for disciplinary action. </p>

<p>The more notable thing that occurs is when the scythe is used on demons and zombies. But that is thoroughly explored in later chapters of the manga. </p>

  <p> <a href=""http://onepiece.wikia.com/wiki/Germa_66"" rel=""nofollow"">Germa 66 or Warmongers</a> as they have been called is an
 organization which is controlled by <a href=""http://onepiece.wikia.com/wiki/Vinsmoke_Family"" rel=""nofollow"">Vinsmoke family</a>, which
 recently we found out is <a href=""http://onepiece.wikia.com/wiki/Sanji"" rel=""nofollow"">Sanji's</a> family. They have ties with the
 <a href=""http://onepiece.wikia.com/wiki/Underworld"" rel=""nofollow"">Underwold</a> and recently with <a href=""http://onepiece.wikia.com/wiki/Charlotte_Linlin"" rel=""nofollow"">Big Mom Pirates</a>, because of the
 marriage/alliance of <a href=""http://onepiece.wikia.com/wiki/Sanji"" rel=""nofollow"">Sanji</a> and <a href=""http://onepiece.wikia.com/wiki/Purin"" rel=""nofollow"">Purin</a>.  As for the nobility
 Vinsmoke family as <a href=""http://onepiece.wikia.com/wiki/Vinsmoke_Reiju"" rel=""nofollow"">Reiju</a> said even though they don't own any
 land, they are still participate at the <a href=""http://onepiece.wikia.com/wiki/Reverie"" rel=""nofollow"">Reverie</a>
 *So to summarize, Germa 66 is an organization that is under the Vinsmoke Family and has a lot of weapons/technology at their disposal. They are not pirates and they have affliction with the nobles not directly but indirectly through Vinsmoke Family.
 This is all we know so far.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> the only interest of Hitto the tournament was to get one of the spacecraft (able to travel between universes).</p>

<p>Champa was concerned, apparently Hitto is a dangerous killer, but Hitto have left to be won was very suspicious.</p>

<p>Why did Hitto pretend to be defeated by Monaka?</p>

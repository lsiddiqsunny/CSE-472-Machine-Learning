Body
"<p>I have a Robo 3D. However A while ago, the print bed was fractured, and now it has a long crack cutting it in half. The bed still works because it is held together, by the screws holding the bed to the tracks. So I want to continue using it, because it still is fairly good, the heating element works fine, and a replacement bed is 80$, and I am unsure if the one sold on the RoBo 3D website will be compatible with my printer as I don't have the R1, but a version before that.</p>

<p><a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/b4osS.jpg"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/b4osS.jpg"" alt=""My cracked bed, with crack running straight through the center""></a></p>

<p>So my question is:
How can I best align the two glass fragments, to provide as flat a print surface as possible, and two how to best hold these two pieces in place, or if it would be best to invest in a new print bed?</p>

<p>EDIT:
Here is a image of the heating element as well to explain the situation with how it is attached<a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/4yr34.jpg"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/4yr34.jpg"" alt=""The heating element attached to the underside of the glass print bed""></a></p>

<p>EDIT:
The RoBo 3D team have said that I just need to upgrade my y-axis with a object on thingiverse and then buy their new build plate. So I am going to experiment with a glass replacement, and if that fails to succeed then I will go along with their suggestion, and buy the upgrade. Thanks everyone for their help.</p>

"<p>IMHO your best bet is to use some kind of a tape. I do not have any experience with robo3dprinter but, I have been using glass with PET tape on in for past 4 years.</p>

<p>I have seen guys using Kapton tape as well. Never tried. </p>

<p>The main disadvantage on this solution is increasing the bed thickness, I am not sure if you are able to tinker with the Z level endstop, in case not this migh be an issue. </p>

<p>The other solution you can try is replace your bed with piece of glass and then apply PET tape or any other kind, I am also not sure if you are able to replace the bed print surface of not.</p>

<p>When using glass and PET tape, you need to get the surface of PET tape rough using sand paper, and you might have to apply so called Acetone Juice to make sure that your ABS prints will stick to the bed.</p>

<p>Acetone juice is basically Aceton with disolved piece of Natural ABS plastic this created sticky layer on your bed that helps to hold your prints on the bed while printing.</p>

"<p>A little chip is fine, but I wouldn't print with that big of a crack. <strong>However</strong>, that doesn't mean you need to spend $80 on a new sheet of glass.</p>

<p>Option #1- If you want borosilicate glass, you can get a sheet from either McMaster (about $40+shipping for a 10""x10"" piece, less for smaller) or from a local glass maker (the price varies a lot, so you should check that also if you want to go that route). However, you won't be able to drill holes (tempered glass <em>will</em> break of you drill a hole). Borosilicate glass has the advantage of being <em>extremely</em> heat-resistant, so it won't break from thermal expansion. If you go this route, you should pick up a few binder clips also to attach the sheet to the heated bed.</p>

<p>Option #2- You might be able to get picture frame glass from a hardware store. It's super cheap (mine was $3 or something from lowes) and they'll often cut it to exact size. You might be able to drill this, but you have to be extremely careful. Sometimes, the hardware store can drill holes in the sheet for you if needed. If you don't want to drill, a few binder clips will work just as well.</p>

<p>Just a note for if you are using binder clips: you might need to (depending on how your hbp is set up) get a piece of glass that is slightly smaller to allow for any bed leveling screws to have room. If you're going with the picture frame glass, you should make sure that the glass will be entirely within the heated part so that there isn't any heat gradient (that's how glass cracks/shatters). </p>

"<p>If you want to do basic edits to an STL, a program such as <a href=""http://www.meshmixer.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">MeshMixer</a> might be right for your. It offers the ability to combine and subtract models, add custom supports, and similar, in a fairly straight forward manner.</p>

<p>An alternative that allows your to do complex editing of STLs would be <a href=""http://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/overview"" rel=""nofollow"">Autodesk Fusion 360</a>. Here you can import STLs into meshes, which you then may convert into solids for further editing. It is more work to use, but a very flexible solution; you can i.e choose to only convert certain faces to solid, or use the mesh as a reference point for other designs. </p>

"<p>I'm using Cura as my slicing/printing software and I just started using the BuildTak printing surface.</p>

<p>The BuildTak is damaged by pushing a hot nozzle into it and my printer's (Robo3D R1+) autoleveling feature works by pushing the nozzle into the build surface.</p>

<p>Is there a way to configure Cura so that it runs the Z probe first, then heat up the nozzle?</p>

<p>My first sheet of BuildTak already has 10 small holes in it (at the homing position and at the 9 leveling touch points)</p>

"<p>I am wondering how people that use standalone 3D printers (printers that have the ability to print autonomously from SD Card) feed in filament, prime the printhead and/or change filaments without a laptop ?</p>

<p>Do the printers have a menu to arrange all these tasks ?
I often only see the options to preheat the head to a certain temperature, but not to load/unload filament, extrude a small amount etc.</p>

<p>I understand this differs from printer to printer, but still am wondering about this.</p>

"<p>I'm thinking of another extruder on my printer, and I'm curious about this one....</p>

<p>Is it necessary to have both hot ends on same height? Why yes / why not? (if there is not)</p>
"
"<p>My printer (IdeaWerk 150) is very basic and doesn't have any options for this from the screen.</p>

<p>I wrote a really simple GCODE file that brings the nozzle up to temperature, then runs the extruder for a few seconds, then waits, then extrudes for a bit again. I think it does this 3 or 4 times then stops. I can put the file (when converted to .x3g!) onto an SD card and run it whenever I need it.</p>

<p>I have a similar file that allows me to level the bed without a computer by just moving the nozzle around to a few key points on the bed and pausing for a few seconds.</p>

<p>I used a GCODE file generated by my slicer in verbose mode to get started, along with a <a href=""http://softsolder.com/2013/03/14/g-code-and-m-code-grand-master-list/"">list of codes</a></p>

<p>I don't have these files to hand at the moment, but this is my <code>start.gcode</code>:</p>

<pre><code>(**** beginning of start.txt ****)
(This file is for a WeisTek IdeaWerk 150)
(**** begin initilization commands ****)
G21 (Metric FTW)
G90 (Absolute Positioning)
M18 (This disables the stepper motors.)

G92 X0 Y0 Z0 A0 B0 (Declare the current position to be 0,0,0,0,0)
(**** end initilization commands ****)

(**** begin homing ****)
G161 Y X F2500
G92 X0 Y0 Z0 A0 B0
G1 X5.0 Y5.0 Z-5.0 F450
G162 Z F450
G161 Y X F2500 (Home X axis maximum, go until reaching the end stop.)

G92 Z142.4 ( ** Set Bed Height ** )

G92 X-75 Y-75 (set zero for X and Y)
(**** end homing ****)

M108 R8.0 (Extruder speed = max)
M6 T0 (wait for toolhead parts, nozzle, HBP, etc., to reach temperature)

G1 Z10 F500 (Bring bed up)

M101 (Turn on Extruder)
G04 P8000 (Wait for 8 seconds for flow)
(**** end of start.txt ****)
</code></pre>

<p>If I feed <em>just</em> this file into my printer, it will heat up the nozzle, bring the bed up to about 10cm below printing height and once the nozzle is at temperature, it turns on the extruder for 8 seconds.</p>

<p>Your printer will likely be different to mine - there are a few different flavours of GCODE and you will likely have different XYZ positions, so take a look at some GCODE generated by your own slicer and identify the different parts. The principle is the same.</p>

"<p>I have searched the internet and found various 3D printers with different advantages and materials which they can print - some even multi color.  </p>

<p>However, I cannot seem to find a printer that can print multiple material with different properties; for instance, simultaneously printing PLA and metal. Is there currently such a printer available or in development? </p>
"
"<p>I don't have dual extruder printer myself, but to my understanding having both nozzles leveled at the same height is critical for getting successful prints.</p>

<p>For typical FDM printers, the lowest point of the end effector should always be the nozzle. If you, for instance, mount a fan lower than the tip of your nozzle, it will eventually collide with the printed object.</p>

<p>The effect of having unequally leveled nozzle tips for a dual extruder printer will be exactly the same: one of the nozzles will either drag against or collide with the model during print; or, one of the nozzles will be to far away from the model, giving poor layer adhesion. Either way, the result will be sub-optimal.</p>

<p>So, leveling both nozzles equally is probably a good idea. You might want to have a look at <a href=""http://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/331/levelling-heads-for-dual-extruder"">this question</a> on some advice regarding how to do it.  </p>
"
"<p>Yes and no.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>for instance simultanious printing of plas plastic and lets say metal. Is such a printer available or in development ?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Practically speaking, no.  Metal printing requires significantly higher temperatures than plastic, and the two processes are so incompatible that there is currently no good solutions that would allow one printer to print both in the same print. Whether extruding filament, laser sintering, or curing resins, the materials involved have to be fairly similar in processing environment to print adjacent to each other without issue.</p>

<p>There are many printers that are intended to print multiple materials by changing the print head.  You might, for instance, use a ceramic paste extruder, then change the head for the next print using plastic.</p>

<p>There have been efforts in the past, and some efforts are ongoing, to resolve this.  For instance wood's metal, a low temperature alloy, can be poured at temperatures compatible with plastics, so it's possible to create a printer that prints plastic, leaving troughs or voids in the plastic, then the same printer during this print would pour molten woods metal into these areas, which then solidifies into an internal metal structure.  These are intended for circuitry and electrical use, however significant problems still exist because the thermal expansion differences in these materials lead to stress and result in poor reliability.</p>

<p>So while some of these processes are being developed, this is still just in the experimental stage and there are significant problems to overcome before printers can print widely different materials in a single printing session.</p>

<p>Of course you can find plastics with such a wide range of characteristics that they can be seen as printing different materials.  Plastics imbued with wood fibers, printing next to conductive plastics with graphite, printing next to flexible plastics, etc, etc are now possible, and depending on your requirements they may meet your needs.</p>
"
"<p>If your printer has no way to move the heads up and down, or otherwise out of the way, and your slicer isn't able to detect collisions and account for head height differences in the produced G code, then they must be at exactly the same height <em>from the bed</em>.</p>

<p>If extruder A is hanging lower than extruder B, then when B has printed at a certain level, and A moves across that area, A will hit the material B has printed.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this is further complicated for newer printers because some of them rely on digital bed leveling.  If your bed isn't parallel to your X and Y axis movement, then you have to work very hard to make sure the heads are parallel to the bed, and with some mechanisms this isn't possible without making the mechanism itself parallel to the bed, so just mounting the new head at the same height as the other head might not be sufficient if your printer isn't perfectly calibrated already.</p>

<p>I have not yet seen a printer or slicer that manages heads of different heights, but I suppose it's possible to manage the problem with additional intelligence.  For instance, if the printer can move the heads up and down independently, it might move one down for printing, and the other up and out of the way when it's not printing, and then the opposite when it switches.  I can't think of a good reason to do this, though.</p>

<p>Another option would be to develop a slicer to generate G-Code that will prevent such collisions.  The printer would necessarily be limited in what it could print depending on the location of the second head, as there are some situations where it would need to print in a certain area, but a collision prevents it from getting to that area.</p>

<p>At any rate, no one has developed such software or mechanisms yet, so if you had good reason to mount the heads at different heights, you'd have to account for all of these factors and develop the complete solution yourself.</p>

"<p>Replacing your bed is the safest option, especially if you have a heated bed. Cracks and chips in the glass create an uneven surface for your prints, and can become a safety hazard; additionally, while borosilicate glass is very resistant to thermal shock, it can continue to crack or shatter when subjected to rapid/uneven temperature variations after damage. Borosilicate glass tends to break in large pieces rather than shattering (snap instead of splintering), but it's still a safety hazard. </p>

<p>It sounds like you have the Kickstarter version of the Robo3D R1; the current glass bed on the Robo3D uses magnets to hold the bed in place, so you'd probably need to replace your Y axis rails along with the bed. I would contact Robo3D support to see what options you have available for upgrading the bed and rails through them. </p>

<p>Aside from Robo3D, you have a few options:
 - If you plan to continue using the bed, Kapton tape is an effective surface application for general printing. It's very thin, but provides an effective surface for ABS &amp; PLA adherence, works with heated beds, and is compatible with secondary adherence items (blue masking tape, PVA glue, ABS slurry, etc). Kapton tape can be damaged after several prints, so plan on having several sheets on hand.
 - You can replace your current borosilicate glass with a new sheet of borosilicate glass from a secondary source
 - Aluminum plates are an effective replacement
 - Lexan sheets also make an effective replacement, but I wouldn't recommend applying heat to them.</p>

"<p>I have a dual extruder Replicator 1 and having the nozzles at the same height is a must and albeit a bit of a struggle otherwise. At one point, I had to disassemble my extruder head and the nozzles didn't line up quite right. There after, printing with the lower one obviously didn't have any troubles, however, printing with the high extruder made it so the lower extruder would scrape the molten plastic layer. This made my surface finish horrible and almost impossible for support structures to be printed.</p>

<p>Instead of fighting with my stock nozzle assembly to get everything perfectly lined up, I just shimmed the one side with some stacks of paper cutouts. This brought my extruders very close to even.</p>

<p>Also, you'll want to make sure excess plastic is cleaned off of <strong>BOTH</strong> nozzles when printing with either nozzle. I found that some prints would fail because of a small discharge from a previous print on the other nozzle.</p>
"
"<p>To add to the above answers, besides the obvious point that one hotend might collide with something another hotend positioned lower than it has printed, you also want both hotends to be positioned X microns above the bed at minimum height so your filament will stick to the bed properly. Position one a bit higher than the other and what it prints won't stick to the bed very well, position one a bit lower and it will hit the bed and clog/be unable to print the first layer.
The only reason I can think of when you'd want one hotend to be higher is a situation when you're not using both hotends and don't want the second hotend to drag on and deform a layer the main hotend has printed and is still warm and deformable. If that's an issue (I doubt) then sure, move it a bit higher.</p>

<p>If there are other reasons for what you would like to have the hotends at different heights, please add that to your question. I can't think of one myself.</p>
"
"<p>If your heatbed itself is aluminum/copper/other metal: Get a glass cut and replace it. The current one is probably attached to the heatbed with adhesive glue. If it the adhesive is cyanocrylate based, you can remove by rubbing with acetone. If silicone type, it will come off by some force. Don't worry, you won't damage aluminum. THe heating element is either inside the aluminum or under it.
If it's not alumunum it's likely a PCB heatbed. Then I wouldn't suggest to use acetone or some ""antiglue"" and would just try to apply a little force and see if the glass moves a bit. If no, don't bother, PCB heatbeds can break too. Then I'd just suggest to apply some epoxy to cover the holes surrounding the cracks and keeping the glasses uniform.</p>

<p>Also, about replacement glasses: picture frame glasses are very cheap. McMaster sells some high quality bearings and rods, but for glass there's no point to waste money. $5 is typical for that size borosilicate glass, if you're in USA (I'm not) I think your local Home Depot will cut it for free for you as well.</p>
"
"<p>In Cura (and Slic3r), you can 100% customize what the printer does before printing your actual model through custom <strong>start/end g-code</strong>.</p>

<p>If you navigate to the <code>Start/End-GCode tab in Cura</code>, then select <code>start.gcode</code>, you can see what operations are run before each print begins. Lines prefixed with <code>;</code> are comments, and does not affect the printing in any way. </p>

<p>Basically, we want to manually tell the printer to do the auto leveling <em>before</em> heating up the nozzle by editing the g-code in <code>start.gcode</code>.</p>

<h3>G-Code generated with the default start.gcode:</h3>

<p>If you try to slice some model with the default code found in <code>start.gcode</code>, you will get something like the following (depending on your printer):</p>

<pre><code>; CURA AUTOMATICALLY INSERTS THESE TEMPERATURE CODES

M190 S70.000000 ; Set bed temperature to 70 degrees
M109 S210.000000 ; Set nozzle temperature to 210 degrees


; THESE ARE THE CODES FROM START.GCODE (for a ROBO 3D R1) 

G28          ;move printer to endstops (the home position)
G92 E0       ;zero the extruded filament length
M565 Z-1     ;set z-probe offset
G1 Z5 F5000  ;move the printer 5mm above the bed
G29          ;run auto-leveling


; THE ACTUAL MODEL BEGINS HERE

;Layer count: 168
;LAYER:0
.
.
</code></pre>

<h3>Analyzing the g-code output</h3>

<p>At the top of this code snippet, we can see that Cura automatically inserts g-code for heating up the bed and nozzle to their respective temperatures with the <a href=""http://reprap.org/wiki/G-code#M190:_Wait_for_bed_temperature_to_reach_target_temp"" rel=""nofollow"">M190</a> and <a href=""http://reprap.org/wiki/G-code#M109:_Set_Extruder_Temperature_and_Wait"" rel=""nofollow"">M109</a> g-codes. This means the printer always will heat up the nozzle before reading the <code>start.gcode</code>s that we set. However, if we manually override <a href=""http://reprap.org/wiki/G-code#M109:_Set_Extruder_Temperature_and_Wait"" rel=""nofollow"">M109</a> code in <code>start.gcode</code>, the <a href=""http://reprap.org/wiki/G-code#M109:_Set_Extruder_Temperature_and_Wait"" rel=""nofollow"">M109</a> at the top will automagically disappear from the generated g-code output! (Thanks, @TomvanderZanden!)</p>

<p>We could therefore use the auto-leveling command <a href=""http://reprap.org/wiki/G-code#G29:_Detailed_Z-Probe"" rel=""nofollow"">G29</a> before manually setting the nozzle temperature with <a href=""http://reprap.org/wiki/G-code#M109:_Set_Extruder_Temperature_and_Wait"" rel=""nofollow"">M109</a>; specifically, we want to add <code>M109 S{print_temperature}</code>, which reads the <code>Basic -&gt; Print Temperature</code>-setting in Cura, and replace <code>{print_temperature}</code> with it automatically.</p>

<h3>Manipulating start.gcode:</h3>

<p>In order to postpone heating the hotend till after probing, <code>start.gcode</code> could be something like: </p>

<pre><code>G28          ;move printer to endstops (the home position)
G92 E0       ;zero the extruded filament length
M565 Z-1     ;set z-probe offset     &lt;-----   ( YOU HAVE TO ADJUST THIS, READ BELOW)
G1 Z5 F5000  ;move the printer 5mm above the bed
G29          ;run auto-leveling
M109 S{print_temperature}    ;set nozzle temperature, and wait for it heat up
</code></pre>

<p>And that's about it! You can then use these codes in your <code>start.gcode</code>. However, you probably will have to recalibrate your z-prove offset. </p>

<h3>Adjust z-probe offset:</h3>

<p>Normally, auto-leveling is done with the nozzle heated for a reason: when the nozzle is warm, it expands slightly, moving closer to the bed. You might therefore have to adjust your Z-probe offset with the <a href=""http://reprap.org/wiki/G-code#M565:_Set_Z_probe_offset"" rel=""nofollow"">M565</a> command (as demonstrated in the snippet) to account for the increase in nozzle length when warm.</p>

<h3>Remember:</h3>

<p>Remember that when editing g-code in this manner, you will take full control of how the printer operates. You could therefore very well do something unintended, so keep the power switch close! </p>
"
"<p>Is there a good method or tool to level the bed of 3D printers? I find myself making small adjustments a lot and it's mostly just trial-and-error. A normal bubble level is of limited help and trying to figure out if the head is the thickness of a sheet of paper from the bed in all corners is beyond the capability of my vision.</p>
"
"<p>I agree with several others that your best bet is to replace the glass entirely. But short of that, you might try something like Loctite ""Glass glue"", which is essentially crazy glue for glass. Be sure to level and clamp well while drying, or you'll end up with it permanently <em>not</em> straight of course. You'd want it clamped to a very flat surface, and clamped pushing the broken edges together. But I think I'd just replace it.</p>
"
"<p>The easiest way I know of (unless your printer has a Z-probe and automatic leveling), is to bring the nozzle(s) down fairly close to the bed (maybe 1/4"" or so), and then move it around while watching for anyplace that doesn't look even. Adjust the bed until it seems even. You can just eyeball it, or use a ruler or object to measure.</p>

<p>Then bring the nozzle down closer, and repeat. Each time you move it closer, you'll be able to eyeball more accurately.</p>

<p>Once you're quite close, pull out a 3x5 card, or business card, or similar, and move the nozzle up or down until the card just fits between the nozzle and the bed (with no great pressure, but no space either). Again, move the head all around the bed, and do any remaining (tiny) adjustments so it's the same everywhere.</p>

<p>Of course if the bed is at all warped this will be much harder, or even impossible. So before starting, put a good-quality straightedge along it to make sure it's actually flat.</p>
"
"<p>For the most part, you can achieve this with a dual extruding printer. However, dual extrusion is best for either multi-color printing or printing with support material. For example, printing the part with PLA and all support material with water soluble PVA.</p>

<p>In practice, printing two completely different materials is not sound engineering practice as they have the potential to not make a well enough bond to each other. So, the case of pure metal and pure plastic, the two materials will not bond well because they will not both be in the same physical state together at any point in time.</p>

<p>However, your best option would be a printer like the <a href=""https://markforged.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">MarkForged</a> which uses a composite approach by combining a common binder (ABS, PLA, Nylon, etc.) and a strong material such as Carbon Fiber, Fiberglass, or Kevlar.</p>
"
"<p>There are several ways.</p>

<p>1) Simplest is the business card/paper method.
This video shows how simple it is: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bzAE5-QgUY"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bzAE5-QgUY</a>
You should feel the same amount of resistance between the hotend and the bed on all sides. On some 3d printers there are 3 screws holding the bed (eg. Solidoodle) and on others there are 4 screws on each edge (eg. Prusa i3).
On some 3d printers you need to rotate a screw with a screwdriver to adjust it (eg Solidoodle 3) and on some you have a nut (mostly wing nut) (eg. Solidoodle 4).</p>

<p>I find most people move the extruder around when adjusting the bed by controlling the motors. I think the quicker way is stopping the motors (in Repetier Host it's the ""Stop Motor"" button) and moving the gantry by hand.</p>

<p>Tutorial: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED1Gxvw2Rmw"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED1Gxvw2Rmw</a></p>

<p>2) Second one is just more advanced version of the above. You use a dial indicator/ micrometer attached to your extruder and make sure the number on the dial is as close as possible on all edges.
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UI6eKDUzdfA"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UI6eKDUzdfA</a>
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K19BaqhYD0c"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K19BaqhYD0c</a></p>

<p>There are also digital versions of this tool.</p>

<p>You might need to print or make someother way a piece to be able to attach a micrometer to the extruder (there might be one for your 3d printer on Thingiverse already).</p>

<p>Now, remember I mentioned that you adjust the height of the edges of the print bed with a screw/nut? Well, since there is a lot of vibration during print those tend to get out of place and that might explain why you end up readjusting it over and over again. What I have found to solve this is to use a single drop of loctite (cyanocrylate glue) in the middle of the nut/screw.

<p>3) Setting up auto-bed leveling on your 3d printer if it's moddable enough.

<p>Finally, if you can't get the bed leveled no matter what, it might be uneven. That's usually caused by warping. Both PCB beds and alumnum beds can get warped. With the former just sandwitch a glass bed on top of it and it should be fine. Warped aluminum is pretty hard to flatten. In this extreme situation you might need to get a new aluminum sheet cut and drilled, preferrably a mm thicker one which is less likely to warp under the same conditions. I think this happens when you either set the bed temp too high and/or the thickness of the aluminum bed is too small (bad or cheap 3d printer design).</p>

"<p>Ocasionally while printing, my <em>y</em> axis will slip,  and the layer will from that point forward be shifted, ruining the print.</p>

<p>What might be the causes of an axis slipping? I have tried cooling the motor which seemed to have been getting warm, and the belts are not too tight.</p>

<p>This does not happen with every print, and seem to be an intermittent problem. </p>

<p>My printer is a MendelMax RepRap, and the Y axis is my moving bed.</p>
"
"<p>From what I've experienced, there could be three potential reasons.</p>

<ol>
<li>Your belt(s) could be loose. Simply loosen your Y-Axis motor and pull the motor until the belt is slightly more than taught (it will relax into a taught position). Then, tighten the motor securely in its place.</li>
<li>One of your axis endstops could be triggered mid-print. If you have a larger print, you run the risk of hitting an endstop, which could cause the machine to lose its coordinate system.</li>
<li>I found on my machine, if you run your program via USB (on MakerWare specifically, possibly others) there might be some sort of lag in the serial connection that could cause the entire program or coordinate system to shift. I repeated this issue multiple time using a USB connection and fixed it (repeatedly) by either running off of an SD card, using a different slicer (in my case the Cura plugin for OctoPi), or trying an earlier version of your software (this was my long term solution).</li>
</ol>

<p>The latter worked best for me. I tried running MakerBot Desktop on my Dual Replicator 1, but ran into the same exact issue as you. In fact, I encountered this issue around firmware 5.0 on the Replicator as well (7.? is the latest). Finally I switched back to using MakerWare 2.4.? and everything worked fine.</p>

"<p>The current to your motor driver could be set either too high or too low. If it's set too low then the torque might not be sufficient and the motor will skip steps. If it's set too high then the driver might overheat and occasionally shut down to protect itself.</p>

<p>Another option is that the printing speeds (or jerk/acceleration settings) are too high. I would start by reducing the travel speed (which presumably is higher than your printing speed) and see if that makes a difference.</p>

<p>The motor getting warm is normal and will not cause these issues.</p>
"
"<p>In my experience, the most common reason for positional offset during printing, is the <em>motor skipping steps due to physical impact</em>. </p>

<p>You stepper motors does not give <em>positional feedback</em> to your printer. So, if you forcefully move your motor during print, then the printer will not notice, and simply pretend it never happened.</p>

<p>In particular, the motor could skip steps if:</p>

<ul>
<li>Your nozzle collide with erroneous extrusions (e.g blobs) during print.</li>
<li>Your speed settings (jerk and accelleratíon) are too high for the mass (inertia) of the parts moved by the y-axis motor.</li>
</ul>

<p>Smaller collisions and nozzle drag at high speed (e.g during travel) could also cause this problem, since the strength of stepper motors is <a href=""https://www.google.no/search?q=stepper%20motor%20strength%20curve%20NEMA%2017&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=1396&amp;bih=805&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwifiuvOwN3KAhXBGCwKHUWHDPgQ_AUIBygB#imgrc=ZBI28Gp2zjb3oM%3A"">reduced at high speeds</a>.</p>

"<p>If you don't have an auto-leveling build plate or a depth gauge attachment for your X-Axis, you're pretty much stuck with the ""piece of paper"" method. To perform this easier, try shifting the paper as you adjust the bed. As soon as the paper becomes difficult to move (the nozzle is touching now), back off the build plate by about a quarter turn.</p>

<p>Please also keep in mind how your printer is constructed. If your build plate arms are plastic, they are easily susceptible to warping if you have a heated build plate. Even if the warping isn't permanent, the build plate can technically shift during a print as the arms get hotter. Some people go as far as replacing these arms with aluminum versions.</p>

"<p>From what I understand, it takes a really long time for the heated bed to heat up using an MK2a heated bed.  I've heard some people suggest that using <a href=""http://forums.reprap.org/read.php?4,584582"" rel=""nofollow"">Polyisocyanurate (PIR) foam</a> (insulation that takes quite a bit of heat to catch on fire) can be used under the headed bed to make it heat up faster.   </p>

<p>Now of course there are other methods for doing this too, for instance using a larger power supply, but at this point I'd rather just use the parts that I have without re-soldering many of the components on the RAMPS board. </p>

<p>I was wondering what a proper way to attach this to the bed would be for instance, should the springs go on the bottom or on the top of the bed?  Do I need some extra parts?  Are there any other considerations for doing this?</p>
"
"<p>If you use a seperate powersupply for your bed (or if your controller has a built in voltage regulator so it doesn't damage at higher voltages) you can sometimes find an small potentiometer near the connection terminals of your powersupply, turning this potentiometer up can raise the outputvoltage of your powersupply by a few volts max. In my case the potentiometer was orange and allowed me to turn up the voltage by almost 2Volts!</p>

<p>If your printcontroller is running from the same powersupply and is critical about input DON'T do this since it will damage the electronics.
Better option then is to find a higher voltage powersupply and power the bed Seperately. </p>

<p>A buddy of mine runs his MARK2a bed on 19V and it heats up very fast. (he uses an obscure 15V powersupply that was able to be cranked up to 19V). And he doesn't use insulation at all!</p>

"<p>An alternative solution that is used with some <a href=""https://www.think3dprint3d.com/3D-Printer-Kits/complete-3D-printer-kits/Kossel-Mini-3dPrinter-Kit"" rel=""nofollow"">Kossel Mini</a> models, is a simple <a href=""https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/RNWfKpkiA_cg16D6gPqcQ4e1uCFmW4-lIV-KVZYnFJyn3EtbCrsH_sXHKXZxkrlPjnHD1giczw676mjnJbq4SwFeJRHEGvfZqdh_j_QoX1kYxGITuiuJ9xQZ023sgMSyCEolIuo"" rel=""nofollow"">cardboard covered with aluminum tape</a> (<a href=""https://docs.google.com/document/d/1k2J78MIDsD2FBHLDnZ06bMdprNjH6nYhkiLUsjemnUc/pub"" rel=""nofollow"">docs</a>).</p>

<p>This solution has the added benefit of actually improving heat-up time, since the reflective surface of the aluminum tape <em>reflects the heat back into the bed</em>, instead of getting absorbed. </p>

<p>It is also a very simple solution, without costly materials. I guess mounting it properly could be an issue depending on your printer, but this is a fine solution for the Kossel models, at least.</p>

"<p>Glass is always level, easy to clean, easy to work with.</p>

<p>Aluminium allows for the addition of automatic bed leveling with an inductive sensor and distributes heat a little more evenly.</p>

<p>When printing mostly ABS and PLA, which one is better?</p>
"
"<p>I believe printing directly on aluminium is unwise, simply because it will expand when heated, typically giving the bed a concave or convex shape. Glass, on the other hand, does not (at least not significantly).</p>

<p>As pointed out in the comments below, the heat expansion of aluminium could potentially be mitigated by increasing the thickness of the bed, as well as heating it evenly. Also, a common solution is to place a glass plate on top of an aluminium bed, at the cost of a slightly longer heat-up time.</p>

<p>In my experience, printing directly on heated glass can be very practical and give a nice surface finish for some PLA variants and other materials that support it. I don't know if printing directly on aluminium can give similar benefits.</p>

"<p>I currently print with a .4mm nozzle on my extruder, and my prints seem to come out fairly accurate; would I see much of a difference if I went to a .3mm?</p>

<p>What are the pros and cons of larger and smaller nozzle sizes?</p>
"
"<p>My understanding is that the only difference is your range that your layer height can be. For example, the optimal layer heights for a 0.4mm nozzle fall between 0.1-0.3mm. So, we can assume a smaller nozzle will yield a lower range. Keep in mind that varying sizes in the nozzle could produce complications more prominently than with a standard size. Things such as ooze, clogging, and filament backup may occur with a smaller nozzle size if your slicing engine is not setup correctly.</p>
"
"<p>1) Smaller nozzle advantage: sharper ""corners"" (higher X and Y resolution)</p>

<p>2) Larger nozzle advantage: faster 3d printing (because you can print the shell faster as each perimeter can be thicker so you'll need less perimeters to be printed to get the same shell thickness. Same true for infill).</p>

<p>3) Smaller nozzle disadvantage (varies, debatable): higher risk of clogging. There are of course other factors which can result in clogging, but this can also affect it as even finer particles in less quality filament can get stuck now.</p>

<p>4) Smallel nozzle disadvantage: since less plastic can come out at a given duration of time, it means less speedy printing of larger layer heights, if at all possible.</p>

<p>I feel like I should get back to (1) and explain why it is so.
When companies market their 3d printer they usually talk about the layer height (the Z resolution) completely ignoring the X and Y. This makes sense for marketing. Luckily it is not hard to explain what is usually left out and what is important for one of the answers to your question on what are advantages of smaller nozzles:</p>

<p>The Z resolution depends on two main things:
1) The stepper motor driver accuracy of your 3d printer's motherboard. Pretty much all are the same now. Claiming your 3d printer can print at 20 micron layer height doesn't say anything, pretty much any 3d printed today can.
2) Nozzle/extruder quality, nozzle diameter. The latter surprisingly does not determine much. Because of how FFF/FMD 3d printing works, the perimeters of your 3d print can be way thinner than your nozzle diameter. This might sound odd but there's a simple explanation: the molten plastic coming out of the hotend is squished and stretched when the head moves. Because it is stretched, it can be made thinner as you increase how much it is squished. There's not much experimentation done on this and available online, only from personal experience I can say I can print perimeters 50% thinner than my 3mm nozzle. So I suppose if you wanted thinner perimeters than that, you would need to swap to a thinner nozzle.
Why would you want thinner perimeters? To get sharper corners or in other words better X and Y resolution for your 3d prints which is ignored by most unlike the overstated ""layer height"" (Z resolution).
Here's an illustration to help you visualize how fatter perimeters and less sharp corners/edges on your 3d model result in ""lower X/Y resolution"" (the illustration is a 2d cutout, viewed from the top):</p>

"<p>I always assumed that the smallest diameter that you could extrude was equal to the diameter of the extruder tip itself. Recently I heard that you can actually extrude a line that's as little as half the width of the nozzle opening.</p>

<p>Is that true in theory? In practice?</p>

<p>My printer's 0.3mm nozzle broke recently, and the only replacement on hand was a 1.2mm nozzle. The prints have been fast, but really coarse and imprecise. I've dialed the extrusion diameter down from about 2mm to 1.2mm for some smaller, more intricate parts, and it worked fine. Can I go down to 0.9mm or 0.6mm extrusion diameter without it screwing up my prints?</p>

<p>If I can't do that, what <em>does</em> happen if I try to print 0.6mm out of a 1.2mm extruder nozzle?</p>

<p>For this question, let's assume an FDM printer using PLA and/or ABS filament.</p>
"
"<p>The main issue with very narrow extrusion widths (less than the nozzle size) is that you get really poor ""nozzle squash."" The plastic isn't pressed down very hard as it's extruded. That causes poor layer bonding and weaker prints. </p>

<p>The flow of molten plastic coming out of the nozzle must be drawn down by tension in order to end up smaller than the nozzle opening, and that drawing effect makes it difficult to get good contact with the previous layer. So you end up with a ""stack of logs"" structure kind of like this:</p>

<p><a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/MwRXM.jpg""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/MwRXM.jpg"" alt=""0.4mm wide by 0.4mm tall strands through a 0.4mm nozzle""></a>
(This photo actually shows layer height = extrusion width = nozzle size, which is another no-no, but the end result is similar.)</p>

<p>What you want instead is something very ""mashed together"" and strong like this:
<a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/zqaDx.jpg""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/zqaDx.jpg"" alt=""0.4mm wide by 0.4mm tall strands through a 0.4mm nozzle""></a></p>

<p>How finely the the strand can draw down -- versus smearing or breaking apart into blobs -- will depend greatly on the type of filament and the printing conditions. For example, nylon draws down extremely well because it experiences a large degree of strain crystallization, and actually gets stronger and stiffer as it's stretched. PLA tends to get more brittle when strained and may break into stringy blobs. ABS doesn't change terribly much because it's highly amorphous. Polymer type, blending agents, print speed, printing temperature, and cooling will control the drawing behavior of the filament. </p>

<p>Another factor to consider is what the strand spacing is within the print. If you set the extrusion width equal to half the nozzle width, depending on the slicer, adjacent strands may be placed with pitch equal or slightly less than half the nozzle width. So after the first strand is printed (say an unimportant inner perimeter) <strong>the <em>next</em> strand will be printed with the nozzle partially overlapping the previous strand.</strong> This effectively creates a constriction to force the plastic out of a smaller opening to one side of the nozzle, which is not too different from printing with a smaller nozzle. Subsequent perimeter strands may then tend to ""heal up"" even if the first is low quality. This effect doesn't completely fix the problem, but it helps account for why under-width strands seem to work better than they ought to.</p>

<p>Of course, even if the strands turn out ok, it's arguable whether there is any benefit. If the goal of a smaller extrusion width is more precision and sharper corners, you may not actually accomplish that goal. When the filament is being drawn down by tension in the cooling polymer, it may tend to ""cut corners"" and get pulled into a rounded arc when the nozzle changes direction. That may defeat the point of using a thinner extrusion width in the first place. Generally I only recommend using under-width strands to capture thin-wall detail that is only a little bit too thin for the nozzle, not as a way to improve overall print quality.</p>

<p>In comparison, having the extrusion width equal or wider than the nozzle ensures the plastic is firmly squished downward into intimate contact with the lower layer. You can fudge this a bit and still get decent results, but it's <em>usually</em> best to keep the extrusion width equal or larger than the nozzle size. There's no hard cutoff where it will / won't work.</p>

<p>You probably don't want to exchange the Arduino unless it is broken. Does it break that often or are the two boards just the predecessors of the one board solution?</p>

<p>What are the benefits/downsides to having one/two boards?</p>
"
"<p>Many 3d printer motherboards are based on Arduino/Atmega microcontroller and just add some stepper motor drivers, MOSFETs and such in a single board. That explains why you use the Arduino IDE to update or modify their firmware.</p>

<p>Now why you would want to use an Arduino + an Arduino shield board like RAMPS? Well if you're not good at electronics, are happy with the cost of your own board, don't care much about upgrades/modding beyond what is possible with your board, maybe you shouldn't, it might be overwhelming.</p>

<p>There are several advantages with using Arduino with a shield for your 3d printer, ""two boards are not just the predecessors of the one board solution"", no.</p>

<p>1) It is moddable/exandable/upgradable/has replacable parts.
If your printer came with its own motherboard that doesn't have additional or enough pins to add more fans, enclosure lights, a second extruder, an LCD and you want to, it sucks. RAMPS can do that, it has plenty of extra pins.
It is upgradable. You want to replace the stepper drivers with a new one? Or you accidentally damaged the one you have? Fear not, you can just replace that instead of the whole motherboard.
Think if it like other motherboards being PCs on which you can't change the CPU, RAM and GPU.</p>

<p>2) It is here for a long time, you will be able to acquire one for a long time.
There isn't just one company making RAMPS or similar sheilds. Sometimes 3d printing companies go out of business or stop producing your particular motherboard. RAMPS is likely here to stay. Because Arduino is very likely here to stay.</p>

<p>3) As said above, not just one company owns or makes RAMPS or other Arduino shields. Besides the possibility of your motherboard not being produced anymore, there's also the advantage of not being at the mercy of one companies pricing and shipping policies. This is true for some other boards as well though.</p>

<p>4) It is possibly cheaper than what have you. I don't want to post a link, but one company right now is selling their derivative of Printrboard for like $180. Check the cost of Arduino Mega, stepper drivers and a RAMPS board yourself, quite a difference. That said, there are some boards which are close in price.</p>

<p>5) It's an Arduino. Why is this a good thing by itself? Because many people who have a 3d printer are tinkerers/makers and they already use Arduino for other projects. It is open source with a rich library to control many things. The modding and upgrades for your 3d printer which can be done with Arduino is another level higher. Or it can be a good learning experience for your future Arduino projects. If on the other hand you already use Arduino and are experienced with it, you might use it just because you know how to control it/fix it better than some specialized board you haven't seen before. Plus for a guy like you your 3d printer's motherboard will be an ""off-the-shelf"" part, that's nice, right?</p>

"<p>There isn't really a big advantage to one solution or the other. The approach of having separate boards means it is more modular and broken parts can be replaced more easily, but electronics don't break on their own: it is almost always user error. If you are even a tiny bit careful when assembling your electronics, you won't ever have anything break and the advantage of having modular electronics is moot. On the other hand, there's no disadvantage to using modular electronics either.</p>

<p>Of course, another advantage of modular electronics is that you can upgrade separate components (for instance, swap in better stepper drivers). The value of this advantage depends on whether you eventually want to upgrade.</p>

"
"<p>The basic answer to your question is to create better <strong>bridging</strong> or <strong>overhangs</strong> on your machine. Bridging is when you are printing between two solid pieces (like a bridge). Overhangs occur when printing off of a single solid piece and coming back. Most slicing engines allow extra settings for speed, fan power, etc for these parameters, just refer to this terminology.</p>

<p>A very common and simple solution in getting features to 3D print properly is to just slow down! If you're not a in a rush to get the part done, you bring down all of the feedrates in your slicing engine. MakerWare has mine at 90/150 mm/s for print and rapid. Typically I'll bring that down to about 50/90. My reasoning is the more time you give the plastic to cool, both while and after printing the layer, the more rigid that layer will be for the next one. When briding or overhanging, there will typically be a sagged area in the print. You can minimize this by providing the plastic more time to cool. Also keep in mind that printing on supports is still technically bridging (printing between two solid pieces).</p>

<p>Another thing to keep in mind is adhesion from one layer to the next matter just as much between the current layer and the previous as the current strand to the one next to it. So, in some cases, increasing your shell could possibly make it easier for the infill/roof/floor strands.</p>

<p>So I edited the start gcode to run the auto-leveling before heating up the hotend</p>

<p>But ABS doesn't stick to the build surface unless I pre-heat the hotend and wait about a minute.</p>

<p>So now I'm looking for a gcode command to put at the end of the start gcode that will make the printer wait a minute before printing</p>

<p>The sequence I'm looing for is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Heat up the bed</li>
<li>Auto level</li>
<li>Raise the hotend a little bit so it doesn't touch the build plate</li>
<li>Heat up the hotend</li>
<li><em>Wait a minute (that's the only part that is missing, everything else works)</em></li>
<li>Start printing</li>
</ul>

<p>Any way to insert a delay into the gcode?</p>

<p>I'm using Cura to slice/print, my printer is Robo3D R1+</p>

"<p>An alternative solution to using a hard delay with the <a href=""http://reprap.org/wiki/G-code#G4:_Dwell"">G4 dwell command</a>, is to increase the time that the temperature set with <a href=""http://reprap.org/wiki/G-code#M109:_Set_Extruder_Temperature_and_Wait"">M109</a> has to be held before it continues with the next command.</p>

<p>In Marlin, this setting is named <code>TEMP_RESIDENCY_TIME</code>, and can be found around line 150 in <code>Configuration.h</code>. By default, this is set to 5 seconds, which looks like:</p>

<pre><code>// Actual temperature must be close to target for this long before M109 returns success
#define TEMP_RESIDENCY_TIME 5  // (seconds)
</code></pre>

<p>If increasing this setting solves your exact problem, I cannot say, but it could be worth looking into.</p>
